You must go back home , because I am too old to marry again . Even if I got married tonight and later had more sons , 
Before this day is over , the wives of the officials of Persia and Media will find out what Queen Vashti has done , and they will refuse to obey their husbands . They won't respect their husbands , and their husbands will be angry with them . 
King Xerxes and his officials liked what Memucan had said , 
Esther answered , Your Majesty , if you really care for me and are willing to help , you can save me and my people . That's what I really want , 
The sailors tried their best to row to the shore . But they could not do it , and the storm kept getting worse every minute . 
So if you are about to place your gift on the altar and remember that someone is angry with you , 
But I tell you not to try to get even with a person who has done something to you . When someone slaps your right cheek , turn and let that person slap your other cheek . 
Keep us from being tempted and protect us from evil . 
 God will be as hard on you as you are on others ! He will treat you exactly as you treat them . 
Lord , my servant is at home in such terrible pain that he can't even move . 
 It is enough for students to be like their teacher and for slaves to be like their master . If people call the head of the family Satan , what will they say about the rest of the family ? 
So don't be afraid ! You are worth much more than many sparrows . 
Anyone who welcomes a prophet , just because that person is a prophet , will be given the same reward as a prophet . Anyone who welcomes a good person , just because that person is good , will be given the same reward as a good person . 
 If you are not on my side , you are against me . If you don't gather in the harvest with me , you scatter it . 
Someone told Jesus , Your mother and brothers are standing outside and want to talk with you . 
Anyone who obeys my Father in heaven is my brother or sister or mother . 
By this time the boat was a long way from the shore . It was going against the wind and was being tossed around by the waves . 
It will be terrible for people who cause even one of my little followers to sin . Those people would be better off thrown into the deepest part of the ocean with a heavy stone tied around their necks ! 
Some people are unable to marry because of birth defects or because of what someone has done to their bodies . Others stay single in order to serve God better . Anyone who can accept this teaching should do so . 
Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own money ? Why should you be jealous , if I want to be generous ? 
 But Jesus called the disciples together and said: You know foreign rulers like to order their people around . And their great leaders have full power over everyone they rule . 
The crowd told them to be quiet , but they shouted even louder , Lord and Son of David , have pity on us ! 
Jesus went into the temple and chased out everyone who was selling or buying . He turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the benches of the ones who were selling doves . 
Then Jesus left the city and went out to the village of Bethany , where he spent the night . 
 Everything they do is just to show off in front of others . They even make a big show of wearing Scripture verses on their foreheads and arms , and they wear big tassels for everyone to see . 
 You will be arrested , punished , and even killed . Because of me , you will be hated by people of all nations . 
 If you are on the roof of your house , don't go inside to get anything . 
 When the Son of Man appears , things will be just as they were when Noah lived . 
But suppose one of the servants thinks the master won't return until late . 
The king will say to them , Whenever you failed to help any of my people , no matter how unimportant they seemed , you failed to do it for me . 
Stay awake and pray that you won't be tested . You want to do what is right , but you are weak . 
When the soldiers had finished making fun of Jesus , they took off the robe . They put his own clothes back on him and led him off to be nailed to a cross . 
He stayed there for 40 days while Satan tested him . Jesus was with the wild animals , but angels took care of him . 
And when they found him , they said , Everyone is looking for you ! 
Is it easier for me to tell this man his sins are forgiven or to tell him to get up and pick up his mat and go on home ? 
Some of the teachers of the Law of Moses were Pharisees , and they saw Jesus eating with sinners and tax collectors . So they asked his disciples , Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners ? 
So the Son of Man is Lord over the Sabbath . 
 The next time Jesus taught beside Lake Galilee , a big crowd gathered . It was so large that he had to sit in a boat out on the lake , while the people stood on the shore . 
The farmer sleeps at night and is up and around during the day . Yet the seeds keep sprouting and growing , and he doesn't understand how . 
The men taking care of the pigs ran to the town and the farms to spread the news . Then the people came out to see what had happened . 
and started begging him for help . He said , My little daughter is about to die ! Please come and touch her , so she will get well and live . 
In the crowd was a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years . 
At that moment Jesus felt power go out from him . He turned to the crowd and asked , Who touched my clothes ? 
It's all right to wear sandals , but don't take along a change of clothes . 
All of them saw him and were terrified . But at this same time he said , Don't worry ! I am Jesus . Don't be afraid . 
He then got into the boat with them , and the wind died down . The disciples were completely confused . 
 Jesus groaned and said , Why are you always looking for a sign ? I can promise you that you will not be given one ! 
Don't be ashamed of me and my message among these unfaithful and sinful people ! If you are , the Son of Man will be ashamed of you when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels . 
Jesus replied , Moses gave you this law because you are so heartless . 
A woman who divorces her husband and marries again is also unfaithful . 
Then Jesus took the children in his arms and blessed them by placing his hands on them . 
Jesus and his disciples went to Jericho . And as they were leaving , they were followed by a large crowd . A blind beggar by the name of Bartimaeus son of Timaeus was sitting beside the road . 
He isn't the God of the dead , but of the living . You Sadducees are all wrong . 
Finally , some men stood up and lied about him . They said , 
It was now the evening before the Sabbath , and the Jewish people were getting ready for that sacred day . 
So they motioned to Zechariah to find out what he wanted to name his son . 
The Holy Spirit came upon Zechariah , and he began to speak:
 You , my son , will be called the prophet of God Most High . You will go ahead of the Lord to get everything ready for him . 
But the angel said , Don't be afraid ! I have good news for you , which will make everyone happy . 
At this time Anna came in and praised God . She spoke about the child Jesus to everyone who hoped for Jerusalem to be set free . 
Enosh , and Seth . The family of Jesus went all the way back to Adam and then to God . 
When Jesus returned from the Jordan River , the power of the Holy Spirit was with him , and the Spirit led him into the desert . 
Hey , Jesus of Nazareth , what do you want with us ? Are you here to get rid of us ? I know who you are ! You are God's Holy One . 
About that time Jesus went off to a mountain to pray , and he spent the whole night there . 
We are shaking the dust from our feet as a warning to you . And you can be sure that God's kingdom will soon be here ! 
Everyone who asks will receive , everyone who searches will find , and the door will be opened for everyone who knocks . 
 The people of Nineveh will also stand there with you and condemn you . They turned to God when Jonah preached , and yet here is something far greater than Jonah . 
It is like what happens when a woman mixes yeast into three batches of flour . Finally , all the dough rises . 
When the banquet was ready , he sent a servant to tell the guests , Everything is ready ! Please come . 
Another guest said , I bought five teams of oxen , and I need to try them out . Please excuse me . 
What will a king do if he has only 10 , 000 soldiers to defend himself against a king who is about to attack him with 20 , 000 soldiers ? Before he goes out to battle , won't he first sit down and decide if he can win ? 
Jesus said , In the same way there is more happiness in heaven because of one sinner who turns to God than over 99 good people who don't need to . 
But Jesus told them: You are always making yourselves look good , but God sees what is in your heart . The things that most people think are important are worthless as far as God is concerned . 
On his way to Jerusalem , Jesus went along the border between Samaria and Galilee . 
 When the Son of Man comes , things will be just as they were when Noah lived . 
In a town there was once a judge who didn't fear God or care about people . 
Jesus stopped and told some people to bring the blind man over to him . When the blind man was getting near , Jesus asked , 
When it was time to harvest the crop , he sent a servant to ask the renters for his share of the grapes . But they beat up the servant and sent him away without anything . 
So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him . Jesus asked , What do you think the owner of the vineyard will do ? 
When the time came for Jesus and the apostles to eat , 
and a servant girl saw him . Then after she had looked at him carefully , she said , This man was with Jesus ! 
Pilate asked Jesus , Are you the king of the Jews ? Those are your words , Jesus answered . 
Someday people will say , Women who never had children are really fortunate ! 
 At that time everyone will say to the mountains , Fall on us ! They will say to the hills , Hide us ! 
 All of Jesus' close friends and the women who had come with him from Galilee stood at a distance and watched . 
but did not find the body of Jesus . They came back , saying they had seen a vision of angels who told them that he is alive . 
who came to tell about the light and to lead all people to have faith . 
 I tell you for certain you will see heaven open and God's angels going up and coming down on the Son of Man . 
But Jesus knew what was in their hearts , and he would not let them have power over him . 
Nicodemus asked , How can a grown man ever be born a second time ? 
My ancestors worshiped on this mountain , but you Jews say Jerusalem is the only place to worship . 
The woman said , I know that the Messiah will come . He is the one we call Christ . When he comes , he will explain everything to us . 
In the city near the sheep gate was a pool with five porches , and its name in Hebrew was Bethzatha . 
Jesus told him , Pick up your mat and walk ! 
Later , Jesus met the man in the temple and told him , You are now well . But don't sin anymore or something worse might happen to you . 
Just as the Father raises the dead and gives life , so the Son gives life to anyone he wants to . 
They found him on the west side of the lake and asked , Rabbi , when did you get here ? 
My Father wants everyone who sees the Son to have faith in him and to have eternal life . Then I will raise them to life on the last day . 
Then Jesus said , You cannot come to me , unless the Father makes you want to come . That is why I have told these things to all of you . 
When the festival was about half over , Jesus went into the temple and started teaching . 
 The Scriptures say that the Messiah will come from the family of King David . Doesn't this mean that he will be born in David's hometown of Bethlehem ? 
 Nicodemus was there at the time . He was a member of the council , and was the same one who had earlier come to see Jesus . He said , 
You are not even 50 years old ! they said . How could you have seen Abraham ? 
What did he do to you ? they asked . How did he heal your eyes ? 
Jesus told him , I came to judge the people of this world . I am here to give sight to the blind and to make blind everyone who can see . 
The people took sides because of what Jesus had told them . 
and asked , Where have you put his body ? They replied , Lord , come and you will see . 
Jesus said: The time has come for the Son of Man to be given his glory . 
Then Jesus told the crowd , That voice spoke to help you , not me . 
They are wrong about God's justice , because I am going to the Father , and you won't see me again . 
You are now very sad . But later I will see you , and you will be so happy that no one will be able to change the way you feel . 
Jesus replied: Do you really believe me ? 
Pilate asked Jesus , What is truth ? Pilate went back out and said , I don't find this man guilty of anything ! 
It was about noon on the day before Passover , and Pilate said to the crowd , Look at your king ! 
Joseph from Arimathea was one of Jesus' disciples . He had kept it secret though , because he was afraid of the Jewish leaders . But now he asked Pilate to let him have Jesus' body . Pilate gave him permission , and Joseph took it down from the cross . 
The sun will turn dark , and the moon will be as red as blood before the great and wonderful day of the Lord appears . 
 Moses said , The Lord your God will choose one of your own people to be a prophet , just as he chose me . Listen to everything he tells you . 
So they called the two apostles back in and told them they must never , for any reason , teach anything about the name of Jesus . 
The high priest and all the other Sadducees who were with him became jealous . 
The captain of the temple police and the chief priests listened to their report , but they did not know what to think about it . 
Peter said to him , You and your money will both end up in hell if you think you can buy God's gift ! 
Saul got up from the ground , and when he opened his eyes , he could not see a thing . Someone then led him by the hand to Damascus , 
Peter said to Aeneas , Jesus Christ has healed you ! Get up and make up your bed . At once he stood up . 
Every one of the prophets has said that all who have faith in Jesus will have their sins forgiven in his name . 
Peter ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ , and they asked him to stay on for a few days . 
When I looked in it , I saw animals , wild beasts , reptiles , and birds . 
This happened three times before it was all taken back into heaven . 
Some of the followers from Cyprus and Cyrene went to Antioch and started telling Gentiles the good news about the Lord Jesus . 
But Paul and Barnabas bravely said: We had to tell God's message to you before we told it to anyone else . But you rejected the message ! This proves that you don't deserve eternal life . Now we are going to the Gentiles . 
where they preached in the town of Perga . Then they went down to Attalia 
The men who were sent by the church went through Phoenicia and Samaria , telling how the Gentiles had turned to God . This news made the Lord's followers very happy . 
God treated them in the same way that he treated us . They put their faith in him , and he made their hearts pure . 
 But Paul did not want to , because Mark had left them in Pamphylia and had stopped working with them . 
So they went on through Mysia until they came to Troas . 
to show them that the Messiah had to suffer , but that he would rise from death . Paul also told them that Jesus is the Messiah he was preaching about . 
 As I was going through your city and looking at the things you worship , I found an altar with the words , To an Unknown God . You worship this God , but you don't really know him . So I want to tell you about him . 
They asked him to stay longer , but he refused . 
Some of the Jews plotted against me and caused me a lot of sorrow and trouble . But I served the Lord and was humble . 
The soldiers obeyed the commander's orders , and that same night they took Paul to the city of Antipatris . 
I don't want to bother you , but please be patient with us and listen to me for just a few minutes . 
When we came ashore , we learned that the island was called Malta . 
The leaders replied , No one from Judea has written us a letter about you . And not one of them has come here to report on you or to say anything against you . 
But we would like to hear what you have to say . We understand that people everywhere are against this new group . 
What I am saying is that we can encourage each other by the faith that is ours . 
All who are wicked will be punished with trouble and suffering . It doesn't matter if they are Jews or Gentiles . 
If he became acceptable to God because of what he did , then he would have something to brag about . But he would never be able to brag about it to God . 
 Everything depends on having faith in God , so that God's promise is assured by his gift of undeserved grace . This promise isn't only for Abraham's descendants who have the Law . It is for all who are Abraham's descendants because they have faith , just as he did . Abraham is the ancestor of us all . 
 When we were baptized , we died and were buried with Christ . We were baptized , so we would live a new life , as Christ was raised to life by the glory of God the Father . 
Our desires fight against God , because they do not and cannot obey God's laws . 
And this hope is what saves us . But if we already have what we hope for , there is no need to keep on hoping . 
 Did the people of Israel understand or not ? Moses answered this question when he told that the Lord had said , I will make Israel jealous of people who are a nation of nobodies . I will make them angry with people who don't understand a thing . 
It is the same way now . God treated the people of Israel with undeserved grace , and so a few of them are still his followers . 
 Has anyone known the thoughts of the Lord or given him advice ? 
 A body is made up of many parts , and each of them has its own use . 
Let the Lord Jesus Christ be as near to you as the clothes you wear . Then you won't try to satisfy your selfish desires . 
Honor God by accepting each other , as Christ has accepted you . 
 As God says in the Scriptures , I will destroy the wisdom of all who claim to be wise . I will confuse those who think they know so much . 
You are God's children . He sent Christ Jesus to save us and to make us wise , acceptable , and holy . 
When I talked with you or preached , I didn't try to prove anything by sounding wise . I simply let God's Spirit show his power . 
 This is because God considers the wisdom of this world to be foolish . It is just as the Scriptures say , God catches the wise when they try to outsmart him . 
Well , having your own husband or wife should keep you from doing something immoral . 
 I instruct married couples to stay together , and this is exactly what the Lord himself taught . A wife who leaves her husband 
However , I think I am obeying God's Spirit when I say she would be happier to stay single . 
I keep my body under control and make it my slave , so I won't lose out after telling the good news to others . 
A woman should wear something on her head . It is a disgrace for a woman to shave her head or cut her hair . But if she refuses to wear something on her head , let her cut off her hair . 
This is why you must examine the way you eat and drink . 
If you really are hungry , you can eat at home . Then you won't condemn yourselves when you meet together . After I arrive , I will instruct you about the other matters . 
But God has put all parts of our body together in the way that he decided is best . 
Love should be your guide . Be eager to have the gifts that come from the Holy Spirit , especially the gift of prophecy . 
 When I went to Troas to preach the good news about Christ , I found that the Lord had already prepared the way . 
 We have been beaten , put in jail , and hurt in riots . We have worked hard and have gone without sleep or food . 
I am not saying this to be hard on you . But , as I have said before , you will always be in our thoughts , whether we live or die . 
God can bless you with everything you need , and you will always have more than enough to do all kinds of good things for others . 
Those people had better understand that when I am with you , I will do exactly what I say in my letters . 
Of course , I am now referring to the wonderful things I saw . One of Satan's angels was sent to make me suffer terribly , so that I would not feel too proud . 
I have said it before , and I will say it again . I hope God will punish anyone who preaches anything different from what you have already believed . 
 Three years later I went to visit Peter in Jerusalem and stayed with him for 15 days . 
 Fourteen years later I went to Jerusalem with Barnabas . I also took along Titus . 
They only asked us to remember the poor , and this was something I had always been eager to do . 
I have died , but Christ lives in me . And I now live by faith in the Son of God , who loved me and gave his life for me . 
And because of what Jesus Christ has done , the blessing promised to Abraham was taken to the Gentiles . This happened so that by faith we would be given the promised Holy Spirit . 
That is how it is with the promises God made to Abraham and his descendant . The promises were not made to many descendants , but only to one , and that one is Christ . 
 But the child who was born in the natural way made trouble for the child who was born because of the Spirit . The same thing is happening today . 
Then , because you belong to Christ Jesus , God will bless you with peace that no one can completely understand . And this peace will control the way you think and feel . 
because what you hope for is kept safe for you in heaven . You first heard about this hope when you believed the true message , which is the good news . 
But now you must stop doing such things . You must quit being angry , hateful , and evil . You must no longer say insulting or cruel things about others . 
And because of you , the Lord's message has spread everywhere in those regions . Now the news of your faith in God is known all over the world , and we don't have to say a thing about it . 
because when we were with you , we told you this would happen . And we did suffer , as you well know . 
Try your best to live quietly , to mind your own business , and to work hard , just as we taught you to do . 
and don't have anything to do with evil . 
Take care of any widow who is really in need . 
In the presence of God and Christ Jesus and their chosen angels , I order you to follow my instructions ! Be fair with everyone , and don't have any favorites . 
Timothy , you belong to God , so keep away from all these evil things . Try your best to please God and to be like him . Be faithful , loving , dependable , and gentle . 
Instruct them to do as many good deeds as they can and to help everyone . Remind the rich to be generous and share what they have . 
Don't be ashamed to speak for our Lord . And don't be ashamed of me , just because I am in jail for serving him . Use the power that comes from God and join with me in suffering for telling the good news . 
Now Christ Jesus has come to offer us God's gift of undeserved grace . Christ our Savior defeated death and brought us the good news . It shines like a light and offers life that never ends . 
and so I am willing to put up with anything . Then God's special people will be saved and given eternal glory because they belong to Christ Jesus . 
The Scriptures train God's servants to do all kinds of good deeds . 
This surely is a true saying . And you should be hard on such people , so you can help them grow stronger in their faith . 
He taught us to give up our wicked ways and our worldly desires and to live decent and honest lives in this world . 
I pray that God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! 
I would like to keep him here with me , where he could take your place in helping me while I am here in prison for preaching the good news . 
Suffering made Jesus perfect , and now he can save forever all who obey him . 
And when the rules for selecting a priest are changed , the Law must also be changed . 
Now Christ has been appointed to serve as a priest in a much better way , and he has given us much assurance of a better agreement . 
 But the Lord found fault with it and said , I tell you the time will come , when I will make a new agreement with the people of Israel and the people of Judah . 
Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement . Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God's eternal blessings ! 
 When the time comes , I will make an agreement with them . I will write my laws on their minds and hearts . 
We have a great high priest who is in charge of God's house . 
 Enoch had faith and did not die . He pleased God , and God took him up to heaven . This is why his body was never found . 
Why do you fight and argue with each other ? Isn't it because you are full of selfish desires that fight to control your body ? 
 My friends , above all else , don't take an oath . You must not swear by heaven or by earth or by anything else . Yes or No is all you need to say . If you say anything more , you will be condemned . 
 Elijah was just as human as we are , and for three and a half years his prayers kept the rain from falling . 
My friends , if any followers have wandered away from the truth , you should try to lead them back . 
Everything will soon come to an end . So be serious and be sensible enough to pray . 
Children , you belong to God , and you have defeated these enemies . God's Spirit is in you and is more powerful than the one who is in the world . 
These enemies belong to this world , and the world listens to them , because they speak its language . 
We are certain God will hear our prayers when we ask for what pleases him . 
The people I am talking about are behaving just like those dreamers who destroyed their own bodies . They reject all authority and insult angels . 
But these people insult powers they don't know anything about . They are like senseless animals that end up getting destroyed , because they live only by their feelings . 
 Then I looked and saw a Lamb standing in the center of the throne surrounded by the four living creatures and the elders . The Lamb looked as if it had once been killed . It had seven horns and seven eyes , which are the seven spirits of God , sent out to all the earth . 
The beast cursed God , and it cursed the name of God . It even cursed the place where God lives , as well as everyone who lives in heaven with God . 
 They cried loudly , and in their sorrow they threw dust on their heads , as they said , Pity the great city of Babylon ! Everyone who sailed the seas became rich from her treasures . But in a single hour the city was destroyed . 
 Its gates are always open during the day , and night never comes . 
the door of the house
He became thankful when they served him food.
He remained quiet and didn't say a thing.
If you are really the son of God, jump off!
When they celebrate Christmas, the tree is way inside.
Visitors are coming from upriver.
Get firewood from outside.
This time there are no berries back there at the place about which they used to talk.
