IT 1S I, TELLING A STORY, ELLANNA, THE KING ISLANDER.
My great-grandmother, my grandmother’s mother, was a shaman.
She was in a community house, which was called Attaaġmiut.
One night, a woman came in there through the doorway in the floor.
When she said that her husband was in great pain and asked that the shaman help him.
From her house down lower in the village, she would get something as payment.
Attausataat is what the shamans called the payment for their services.
The woman paid her with sinew, with good sinew.
Those pieces of sinew she placed under and alongside the Iñupiaq lamp, the old-style stone lamp.
She went along with the woman, down to another house in the village.
They entered a place under a large rock.
There was a man suffering and in great pain.
He had a lance in him, someone had speared him with a lance.
My great-grandmother removed the lance. 
She went back to the qagri where she lived.
She slept.
It wasn't far away... she was my grandmother’s mother.
She slept and then woke up.
She remembered 
Those things I was paid with last night are down below there.
She reached and got them from underneath the stone lamp.
They had turned into grass.
The sinew she had been given the night before had turned into grass.
That is the end of the story.
