Boaz went over to Ruth and said , I think it would be best for you not to pick up grain in anyone else's field . Stay here with the women 
to bring Queen Vashti to him . The king wanted her to wear her crown and let his people and his officials see how beautiful she was . 
Everyone in the provinces knew that the king had promoted him and had given him a lot of power . 
Why did you celebrate when such a dreadful disaster struck your relatives ? Why were you so pleased when everyone in Judah was suffering ? 
But when he heard that Herod's son Archelaus was now ruler of Judea , he was afraid to go there . Then in a dream he was told to go to Galilee , 
 Then a voice from heaven said , This is my own dear Son , and I am pleased with him . 
But I tell you if you look at another woman and want her , you are already unfaithful in your thoughts . 
 You know our ancestors were told , Don't use the Lord's name to make a promise unless you are going to keep it . 
 You know you have been taught , An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . 
The man got up and went home . 
As Jesus and his disciples were on their way , some people brought to him a man who could not talk because a demon was in him . 
Don't take along any gold , silver , or copper coins . 
 Everyone will hate you because of me . But if you remain faithful until the end , you will be saved . 
 Jesus answered: You surely must have read what David did when he and his followers were hungry . 
So if Satan fights against himself , how can his kingdom last ? 
 Such large crowds gathered around him that he had to sit in a boat , while the people stood on the shore . 
When the plants came up and began to mature , the farmer's servants could see the weeds . 
Leave the weeds alone until harvest time . Then I'll tell my workers to gather the weeds and tie them up and burn them . But I'll order them to store the wheat in my barn . 
The men in the boat worshiped Jesus and said , You really are the Son of God ! 
 If your eye causes you to sin , poke it out and get rid of it . You would be better off to go into life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fires of hell . 
 I promise you God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth , but God will not allow anything you don't allow . 
The king felt sorry for him and let him go free . He even told the official that he did not have to pay back the money . 
After he had agreed to pay them the usual amount for a day's work , he sent them off to his vineyard . 
If you have faith when you pray , you will be given whatever you ask for . 
Jesus had gone into the temple and was teaching when the chief priests and the leaders of the people came up to him . They asked , What right do you have to do these things ? Who gave you this authority ? 
Go out to the street corners and tell everyone you meet to come to the banquet . 
When the king went in to meet the guests , he found that one of them wasn't wearing the right kind of clothes for the wedding . 
 The Sadducees did not believe people would rise to life after death . So that same day some of the Sadducees came to Jesus and said:
But this is just the beginning of troubles . 
Learn a lesson from a fig tree . When its branches sprout and start putting out leaves , you know summer is near . 
Always be ready ! You don't know when the Son of Man will come . 
But when his disciples saw this , they became angry and complained , Why such a waste ? 
Again Jesus went to pray and said , My Father , if there is no other way , and I must suffer , I will still do what you want . 
 That is what you say ! Jesus answered . But I tell all of you , ‘Soon you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right side of God All-Powerful and coming on the clouds of heaven . ’ 
 The high priest then tore his robe and said , This man claims to be God ! We don't need any more witnesses ! You have heard what he said . 
Jesus was brought before Pilate the governor , who asked him , Are you the king of the Jews ? Those are your words ! Jesus answered . 
So when the crowd came together , Pilate asked them , Which prisoner do you want me to set free ? Do you want Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Messiah ? 
The governor's soldiers led Jesus into the fortress and brought together the rest of the troops . 
All this time Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb . 
I baptize you with water , but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit ! 
The seeds that fell on rocky ground are the people who gladly hear the message and accept it at once . 
So they left the crowd , and his disciples started across the lake with him in the boat . Some other boats followed along . 
Jesus was in the back of the boat with his head on a pillow , and he was asleep . His disciples woke him and said , Teacher , don't you care that we're about to drown ? 
 If any place won't welcome you or listen to your message , leave and shake the dust from your feet as a warning to them . 
But so many people were coming and going that Jesus and the apostles did not even have a chance to eat . Then Jesus said , Let's go to a place where we can be alone and get some rest . 
Jesus told his disciples to tell the people to sit down on the green grass . 
Jesus knew what they were thinking and asked , Why are you talking about not having any bread ? Don't you understand ? Are your minds still closed ? 
What will you gain , if you own the whole world but destroy yourself ? 
After Jesus left , he went to Judea and then on to the other side of the Jordan River . Once again large crowds came to him , and as usual , he taught them . 
Some Pharisees wanted to test Jesus . So they came up to him and asked if it was right for a man to divorce his wife . 
Everything you ask for in prayer will be yours , if you only have faith . 
Many will come and claim to be me . They will use my name and fool many people . 
If the Lord doesn't make the time shorter , no one will be left alive . But because of his chosen and special ones , he will make the time shorter . 
 You will always have the poor with you . And whenever you want to , you can give to them . But you won't always have me here with you . 
He answered , It is one of you twelve men who is eating from this dish with me . 
During the meal Jesus took some bread in his hands . He blessed the bread and broke it . Then he gave it to his disciples and said , Take this . It is my body . 
Pilate knew that the chief priests had brought Jesus to him because they were jealous . 
 People who passed by said terrible things about Jesus . They shook their heads and shouted , Ha ! So you're the one who claimed you could tear down the temple and build it again in three days . 
The crowd was waiting for Zechariah and kept wondering why he was staying in the temple so long . 
 On us who live in the dark shadow of death this light will shine to guide us into a life of peace . 
And now she was 84 years old . Night and day she served God in the temple by praying and often going without eating . 
After Passover his parents left , but they did not know that Jesus had stayed on in the city . 
Matthat , Levi , Melchi , Jannai , Joseph , 
But now you will see that the Son of Man has the right to forgive sins here on earth . Jesus then said to the man , Get up ! Pick up your mat and walk home . 
The teachers and the Pharisees were furious and started saying to one another , What can we do about Jesus ? 
A good tree cannot produce bad fruit , and a bad tree cannot produce good fruit . 
 No one lights a lamp and puts it under a bowl or under a bed . A lamp is always put on a lampstand , so people who come into a house will see the light . 
As Jesus was getting out of the boat , he was met by a man from this town . The man had demons in him . He had gone naked for a long time and no longer lived in a house , but in the graveyard . 
Jesus strictly warned his disciples not to tell anyone about this . 
Are you trying to fool someone ? You can predict the weather by looking at the earth and sky , but you don't really know what's going on right now . 
and carry it home . Then you will call in your friends and neighbors and say , Let's celebrate ! I've found my lost sheep . 
The son said , Father , I have sinned against God in heaven and against you . I am no longer good enough to be called your son . 
Jesus said to his disciples: The time will come when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man , but you will not . 
 The tax collector stood off at a distance and did not think he was good enough even to look up toward heaven . He was so sorry for what he had done that he pounded his chest and prayed , God , have pity on me ! I am such a sinner . 
The people who were going along with Jesus told the man to be quiet . But he shouted even louder , Son of David , have pity on me ! 
 The Sadducees did not believe that people would rise to life after death . So some of them came to Jesus 
 and said: Teacher , Moses wrote that if a married man dies and has no children , his brother should marry the widow . Their first son would then be thought of as the son of the dead brother . 
There were once seven brothers . The first one married , but died without having any children . 
he said to them , I have very much wanted to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer . 
Everyone in the council got up and led Jesus off to Pilate . 
He freed the man who was in jail for rioting and murder , because he was the one the crowd wanted to be set free . Then Pilate handed Jesus over for them to do what they wanted with him . 
 Jesus led his disciples out to Bethany , where he raised his hands and blessed them . 
Yet some people accepted him and put their faith in him . So he gave them the right to be the children of God . 
The Law was given by Moses , but Jesus Christ brought us undeserved kindness and truth . 
I saw this happen , and I tell you that he is the Son of God . 
Jesus replied , Mother , my time hasn't yet come ! You must not tell me what to do . 
In Jerusalem during Passover many people put their faith in Jesus , because they saw him work miracles . 
Then everyone who has faith in the Son of Man will have eternal life . 
People who do evil hate the light and won't come to the light , because it clearly shows what they have done . 
They went to John and said , Rabbi , you spoke about a man when you were with him east of the Jordan . He is now baptizing people , and everyone is going to him . 
The boy's father realized that at one o'clock the day before , Jesus had told him , Your son will live ! So the man and everyone in his family put their faith in Jesus . 
Later , Jesus went to Jerusalem for another Jewish festival . 
The man answered , Sir , I don't have anyone to put me in the pool when the water is stirred up . I try to get in , but someone else always gets there first . 
The Father wants all people to honor the Son as much as they honor him . When anyone refuses to honor the Son , this is the same as refusing to honor the Father who sent him . 
I tell you for certain that everyone who hears my message and has faith in the one who sent me has eternal life and will never be condemned . They have already gone from death to life . 
What exactly does God want us to do ? the people asked . 
And the bread that God gives is the one who came down from heaven to give life to the world . 
I am the bread that gives life ! 
Yet here he is , speaking for everyone to hear . And no one is arguing with him . Do you suppose the authorities know he is the Messiah ? 
A lot of people in the crowd put their faith in him and said , When the Messiah comes , he surely won't perform more miracles than this man has done ! 
They answered , No one has ever spoken like this man ! 
The Pharisees said to them , Have you also been fooled ? 
He answered , Someone named Jesus made some mud and smeared it on my eyes . He told me to go and wash it off in Siloam Pool . When I did , I could see . 
How strange ! the man replied . He healed my eyes , and yet you don't know where he comes from . 
The sheep will not follow strangers . They don't recognize a stranger's voice , and they run away . 
Now I am deeply troubled , and I don't know what to say . But I must not ask my Father to keep me from this time of suffering . In fact , I came into the world to suffer . 
Stay joined to me and let my teachings become part of you . Then you can pray for whatever you want , and your prayer will be answered . 
 Jesus told Peter , Put your sword away . I must drink from the cup that the Father has given me . 
Jesus answered , My kingdom doesn't belong to this world . If it did , my followers would have fought to keep me from being handed over to our leaders . No , my kingdom doesn't belong to this world . 
Then Pilate handed Jesus over to be nailed to a cross . Jesus was taken away , 
Jesus said , Come and eat ! But none of the disciples dared ask who he was . They knew he was the Lord . 
Jesus did many other things . If they were all written in books , I don't suppose there would be room enough in the whole world for all the books . 
While the apostles were still with Jesus , they asked him , Lord , are you now going to give Israel its own king again ? 
It was already late in the afternoon , and they arrested Peter and John and put them in jail for the night . 
 Then Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran . After his father died , Abraham came and settled in this land where you now live . 
 But he also said , I will punish the nation that makes them slaves . Then later they will come and worship me in this place . 
and he has seen a vision . He saw a man named Ananias coming to him and putting his hands on him , so he could see again . 
As Peter entered the house , he was still talking with Cornelius . Many people were there , 
and Peter said to them , You know that we Jews are not allowed to have anything to do with other people . But God has shown me that he doesn't think anyone is unclean or unfit . 
Paul and Barnabas preached the good news in Derbe and won some people to the Lord . Then they went back to Lystra , Iconium , and Antioch in Pisidia . 
After arriving in Antioch , they called the church together . They told the people what God had helped them do and how he had made it possible for the Gentiles to believe . 
 They had talked it over for a long time , when Peter got up and said: My friends , you know that God decided long ago to let me be the one from your group to preach the good news to the Gentiles . God did this so they would hear and obey him . 
Simon Peter has told how God first came to the Gentiles and made some of them his own people . 
We must remember that the Law of Moses has been preached in city after city for many years , and every Sabbath it is read in our synagogues . 
Judas and Silas were prophets , and they spoke a long time , encouraging and helping the Lord's followers . 
They traveled through Syria and Cilicia , encouraging the churches . 
About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing praises to God , while the other prisoners listened . 
some of the men put their faith in the Lord and went with Paul . One of them was a council member named Dionysius . A woman named Damaris and several others also put their faith in the Lord . 
Every Sabbath , Paul went to the synagogue . He spoke to Jews and Gentiles and tried to win them over . 
While Apollos was in Corinth , Paul traveled across the hill country to Ephesus , where he met some of the Lord's followers . 
No one can deny this , and so you should calm down and not do anything foolish . 
After the Festival of Thin Bread , we sailed from Philippi . Five days later we met them in Troas and stayed there for a week . 
and he had four unmarried daughters who prophesied . 
Then we got ready to go to Jerusalem . 
The light had been so bright that I couldn't see . And the others had to lead me by the hand to Damascus . 
 The Sadducees do not believe in angels or spirits or that the dead will rise to life . But the Pharisees believe in all of these , 
and learned that the charges concern only their religious laws . This man isn't guilty of anything for which he should die or even be put in jail . 
But Festus told them , Paul will be kept in Caesarea , and I am soon going there myself . 
We all fell to the ground . Then I heard a voice say to me in Aramaic , Saul , Saul , why are you so cruel to me ? It's foolish to fight against me ! 
They cut the anchors loose and let them sink into the sea . At the same time they untied the ropes that were holding the rudders . Next , they raised the sail at the front of the ship and let the wind carry the ship toward the beach . 
God has seen how I never stop praying for you , while I serve him with all my heart and tell the good news about his Son . 
Those people who don't know about God's Law will still be punished for what they do wrong . And the Law will be used to judge everyone who knows what it says . 
Don't let sin rule your body . After all , your body is bound to die , so don't obey its desires 
or let any part of it become a slave of evil . Give yourselves to God , as people who have been raised from death to life . Make every part of your body a slave that pleases God . 
If you do , you will die . But you will live , if by the help of God's Spirit you say No to your desires . 
God's Spirit makes us sure that we are his children . 
 The Spirit makes us sure about what we will be in the future . But now we groan silently , while we wait for God to show that we are his children . This means that our bodies will also be set free . 
I am sure that nothing can separate us from God's love—not life or death , not angels or spirits , not the present or the future , 
I would gladly be placed under God's curse and be separated from Christ for the good of my own people . 
God did not turn his back on his chosen people . Don't you remember reading in the Scriptures how Elijah complained to God about the people of Israel ? 
After all , it wasn't natural for branches to be cut from a wild olive tree and to be made part of a cultivated olive tree . So it is much more likely that God will join the natural branches back to the cultivated olive tree . 
Don't be like the people of this world , but let God change the way you think . Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him . 
 Be friendly with everyone . Don't be proud and feel that you know more than others . Make friends with ordinary people . 
Night is almost over , and day will soon appear . We must stop behaving as people do in the dark and be ready to live in the light . 
But you should not criticize others for eating or for not eating . After all , God welcomes everyone . 
The one who plants is just as important as the one who waters . And each one will be paid for what they do . 
Don't you know that God's people will judge the world ? And if you are going to judge the world , can't you settle small problems ? 
If your husband isn't a follower , but is willing to stay with you , don't divorce him . 
As far as the Lord is concerned , men and women need each other . 
This is why many of you are sick and weak and why a lot of others have died . 
Just as we will die because of Adam , we will be raised to life because of Christ . 
We see that the one with a spiritual body did not come first . He came after the one who had a physical body . 
My dear friends , stand firm and don't be shaken . Always keep busy working for the Lord . You know that everything you do for him is worthwhile . 
 The Scriptures say , God commanded light to shine in the dark . Now God is shining in our hearts to let you know that his glory is seen in Jesus Christ . 
We are not trying once more to brag about ourselves . But we want you to be proud of us , when you are with those who are not sincere and brag about what others think of them . 
Whether we were honored or dishonored or praised or cursed , we always told the truth about ourselves . But some people said we did not . 
When I wrote you , it wasn't to accuse the one who was wrong or to take up for the one who was hurt . I wrote , so God would show you how much you do care for us . 
 Even when I was in need , I still didn't bother you . In fact , some of the Lord's followers from Macedonia brought me what I needed . I have not been a burden to you in the past , and I will never be a burden . 
You agree that I wasn't a burden to you . Maybe that's because I was trying to catch you off guard and trick you . 
Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you ? Actually , we have been speaking to God as followers of Christ . But , my friends , we did it all for your good . 
I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will bless you and be kind to you ! May God bless you with his love , and may the Holy Spirit join all your hearts together . 
You were doing so well until someone made you turn from the truth . 
 A little yeast can change a whole batch of dough , 
And because we belong to Christ Jesus , we have killed our selfish feelings and desires . 
There Christ rules over all forces , authorities , powers , and rulers . He rules over all beings in this world and will rule in the future world as well . 
 Don't get so angry that you sin . Don't go to bed angry 
This is a great mystery , but I understand it to mean Christ and his church . 
Give my greetings to all who are God's people because of Christ Jesus . The Lord's followers here with me send you their greetings . 
God's Son was before all else , and by him everything is held together . 
I am glad I can suffer for you . I am pleased also that in my own body I can continue the suffering of Christ for his body , the church . 
 Let the message about Christ completely fill your lives , while you use all your wisdom to teach and instruct each other . With thankful hearts , sing psalms , hymns , and spiritual songs to God . 
Whatever you say or do should be done in the name of the Lord Jesus , as you give thanks to God the Father because of him . 
Please pray that I will make the message as clear as possible . 
Give my greetings to the followers at Laodicea , especially to Nympha and the church that meets in her home . 
We begged , encouraged , and urged each of you to live in a way that would honor God . He is the one who chose you to share in his own kingdom and glory . 
At last , when I could not wait any longer , I sent Timothy to find out about your faith . I hoped Satan had not tempted you and made all our work useless . 
We believe Jesus died and was raised to life . We also believe that when God brings Jesus back again , he will bring with him all who had faith in Jesus before they died . 
and with a flaming fire . Our Lord Jesus will punish anyone who doesn't know God and won't obey his message . 
 When our Lord Jesus returns , we will be gathered up to meet him . So I ask you , my friends , 
Church officials must be in control of their own families , and they must see that their children are obedient and always respectful . 
Finally , they must be well-respected by people who are not followers . Then they won't be trapped and disgraced by the devil . 
Those who serve well as officers will earn a good reputation and will be highly respected for their faith in Christ Jesus . 
I hope to visit you soon . But I am writing these instructions , 
We have put our hope in the living God , who is the Savior of everyone , but especially of those who have faith . This is why we work and struggle so hard . 
Those people who disagree are proud of themselves , but they don't really know a thing . Their minds are sick , and they like to argue over words . They cause jealousy , disagreements , unkind words , evil suspicions , 
Be humble when you correct people who oppose you . Maybe God will lead them to turn to him and learn the truth . 
But you must stay calm and be willing to suffer . You must work hard , telling the good news and to do your job well . 
Everything is pure for someone whose heart is pure . But nothing is pure for an unbeliever with a dirty mind . That person's mind and conscience are destroyed . 
Tell the older men to have self-control and to be serious and sensible . Their faith , love , and patience must never fail . 
 And when God speaks about the angels , he says , I change my angels into wind and my servants into flaming fire . 
 Angels are merely spirits sent to serve people who are going to be saved . 
 He even said to God , I will tell them your name and sing your praises when they come together to worship . 
But God has promised us a Sabbath when we will rest , even though it has not yet come . 
God's word is alive and powerful ! It is sharper than any double-edged sword . His word can cut through our spirits and souls and through our joints and marrow , until it discovers the desires and thoughts of our hearts . 
 When Christ came into the world , he said to God , Sacrifices and offerings are not what you want , but you have given me my body . 
No , you are not pleased with animal sacrifices and offerings for sin . 
So we are made holy because Christ obeyed God and offered himself once for all . 
 Abraham had faith and obeyed God . He was told to go to the land that God had said would be his , and he left for a country he had never seen . 
because he was sure that God could raise people to life . This was just like getting Isaac back from death . 
 Some women received their loved ones back from death . Many of these people were tortured , but they refused to be released . They were sure they would get a better reward when the dead are raised to life . 
God corrects all his children , and if he doesn't correct you , then you don't really belong to him . 
 Watch out for immoral and ungodly people like Esau , who sold his future blessing for only one meal . 
 because they could not obey its commands . They were even told to kill any animal that touched the mountain . 
Be humble in the Lord's presence , and he will honor you . 
 You refused to pay the people who worked in your fields , and now their unpaid wages are shouting out against you . The Lord All-Powerful has surely heard the cries of the workers who harvested your crops . 
 If you have sinned , you should tell each other what you have done . Then you can pray for one another and be healed . The prayer of an innocent person is powerful , and it can help a lot . 
You have never seen Jesus , and you don't see him now . But still you love him and have faith in him , and no words can tell how glad and happy 
 Christ carried the burden of our sins . He was nailed to the cross , so we would stop sinning and start living right . By his cuts and bruises you are healed . 
 If you are a husband , you should be thoughtful of your wife . Treat her with honor , because she isn't as strong as you are , and she shares with you in the gift of life . Then nothing will stand in the way of your prayers . 
 Just as shepherds watch over their sheep , you must watch over everyone God has placed in your care . Do it willingly in order to please God , and not simply because you think you must . Let it be something you want to do , instead of something you do merely to make money . 
self-control , patience , devotion to God , 
And if we know God listens when we pray , we are sure our prayers have already been answered . 
Everything that is wrong is sin , but not all sins are deadly . 
You also know about the angels who didn't do their work and left their proper places . God chained them with everlasting chains and is now keeping them in dark pits until the great day of judgment . 
to judge everyone . He will punish all those ungodly people for all the evil things they have done . The Lord will surely punish those ungodly sinners for every evil thing they have ever said about him . 
 Remember the teaching you were given and heard . Hold firmly to it and turn from your sins . If you don't wake up , I will come when you least expect it , just as a thief does . 
After this , I looked and saw a door that opened into heaven . Then the voice that had spoken to me at first and that sounded like a trumpet said , Come up here ! I will show you what must happen next . 
Twenty-four other thrones were in a circle around that throne . And on each of these thrones there was an elder dressed in white clothes and wearing a gold crown . 
12 , 000 from Judah , 12 , 000 from Reuben , 12 , 000 from Gad , 
The angels who stood around the throne knelt in front of it with their faces to the ground . The elders and the four living creatures knelt there with them . Then they all worshiped God 
 A war broke out in heaven . Michael and his angels were fighting against the dragon and its angels . 
The snake then spewed out water like a river to sweep the woman away . 
The oceans you saw the prostitute sitting on are crowds of people from all races and languages . 
 I saw a new heaven and a new earth . The first heaven and the first earth had disappeared , and so had the sea . 
 The wall was built of jasper , and the city was made of pure gold , clear as crystal . 
He is putting boots on.
he returned home to the one he had previously leftHe goes to bed at night and gets up by day to work.
If anyone thinks that he is standing unshakably, 
The disciples came to Jesus privately and asked him
My dear, please bring my berries from right over there.
There are cranberries on the hill back there.
He is playing among the children out there.
