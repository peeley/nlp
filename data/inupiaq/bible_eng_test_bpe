Three days later , Esther dressed in her royal robes and went to the in@@ ner court of the palace in front of the throne . The king was sitting there , fa@@ cing the open do@@ or@@ way . 
He was happy to see Esther , and he held out the gold scepter to her . When Esther came up and touched the ti@@ p of the scepter , 
the king said , Esther , what brings you here ? Just ask , and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom . 
Esther answered , Your Majesty , please come with Haman to a dinner I will prepare for you later today . 
The king said to his servants , Hurry and get Haman , so we can accept Esther's invi@@ tation . The king and Haman went to Esther's dinner , 
and while they were drinking wine , the king asked her , What can I do for you ? Just ask , and I will give you as much as half of my kingdom . 
Haman was feeling great as he left . But when he saw Mordecai at the palace gate , he noticed that Mordecai did not stand up or show him any respect . This made Haman really angry , 
but he did not say a thing . When Haman got home , he called together his friends and his wife Z@@ er@@ esh 
and started bragging about his great wealth and all his sons . He told them the many ways that the king had honored him and how all the other officials and leaders had to respect him . 
Haman added , That's not all ! Besides the king himself , I'm the only person Queen Esther invited for dinner . She has also invited the king and me to dinner tomorrow . 
But none of this makes me happy , as long as I see that Jew Mordecai serving the king . 
Haman's wife and friends said to him , Have a gallows built about 2@@ 2 meters high , and tomorrow morning ask the king to hang Mordecai there . Then later , you can have dinner with the king and enjoy yourself . This seemed like a good i@@ dea to Haman , and he had the gallows built . 
 The Pharisees and Sadducees came to Jesus and tried to test him by asking for a sign from heaven . 
He told them: If the sky is red in the evening , you say the wea@@ ther will be good . 
But if the sky is red and gloomy in the morning , you say it is going to rain . You can tell what the wea@@ ther will be like by looking at the sky . But you don't understand what is happening now . 
 You want a sign because you are evil and won't believe ! But the only sign you will be given is what happened to Jonah . Then Jesus left . 
The disciples had forgotten to bring any bread when they crossed the lake . 
 Jesus then warned them , Watch out ! Guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees . 
The disciples talked this over and said to each other , He must be saying this because we didn't bring along any bread . 
Jesus knew what they were thinking and said: You surely don't have much faith ! Why are you talking about not having any bread ? 
 Don't you understand ? Have you forgotten about the 5 , 000 people and all those baskets of leftovers from just five loaves of bread ? 
 And what about the 4 , 000 people and all those baskets of leftovers from only seven loaves of bread ? 
Don't you know by now that I am not talking to you about bread ? Watch out for the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees ! 
Finally , the disciples understood that Jesus wasn't talking about the yeast used to make bread , but about the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees . 
When Jesus and his disciples were near the town of Caesarea Philippi , he asked them , What do people say about the Son of Man ? 
 The disciples answered , Some people say you are John the Baptist or ma@@ ybe Elijah or Jer@@ e@@ mi@@ ah or some other prophet . 
Then Jesus asked , But who do you say I am ? 
 Simon Peter spoke up , You are the Messiah , the Son of the living God . 
Jesus told him: Simon , son of Jonah , you are blessed ! You didn't discover this on your own . It was shown to you by my Father in heaven . 
So I will call you Peter , which means a rock . On this rock I will build my church , and death itself will not have any power over it . 
 I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven , and God in heaven will allow whatever you allow on earth . But he will not allow anything you don't allow . 
Jesus told his disciples not to tell anyone he was the Messiah . 
From then on , Jesus began telling his disciples what would happen to him . He said , I must go to Jerusalem . There the nation's leaders , the chief priests , and the teachers of the Law of Moses will make me suffer terribly . I will be killed , but three days later I will rise to life . 
Peter took Jesus aside and told him to stop talking like that . He said , God would never let this happen to you , Lord ! 
Jesus turned to Peter and said , Satan , get away from me ! You're in my way because you think like everyone else and not like God . 
 Then Jesus said to his disciples: If any of you want to be my followers , you must forget about yourself . You must take up your cross and follow me . 
 If you want to save your life , you will destroy it . But if you give up your life for me , you will find it . 
What will you gain , if you own the whole world but destroy yourself ? What would you give to get back your soul ? 
 The Son of Man will soon come in the glory of his Father and with his angels to reward all people for what they have done . 
I promise you some of those standing here will not die before they see the Son of Man coming with his kingdom . 
 When you collect money for God's people , I want you to do exactly what I told the churches in Galatia to do . 
That is , each Sunday each of you must put aside part of what you have earned . If you do this , you won't have to take up a collec@@ tion when I come . 
Cho@@ ose some followers to take the money to Jerusalem . I will send them on with the money and with letters which show that you app@@ ro@@ ve of them . 
If you think I should go along , they can go with me . 
 After I have gone through Macedonia , I hope to see you 
and visit with you for a while . I may even stay all winter , so that you can help me on my way to wherever I will be going next . 
If the Lord lets me , I would rather come later for a longer visit than to stop off now for only a short visit . 
 I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost , 
because there is a wonderful opp@@ or@@ tun@@ i@@ ty for me to do some work here . But there are also many people who are against me . 
 When Timothy arrives , give him a friendly welcome . He is doing the Lord's work , just as I am . 
Don't let anyone mistreat him . I am looking for him to return to me together with the other followers . So when he leaves , send him off with your blessings . 
I have tried hard to get our friend Apollos to visit you with the other followers . He doesn't want to come just now , but he will come when he can . 
Keep alert . Be firm in your faith . Stay brave and strong . 
Show love in everything you do . 
 You know that Steph@@ an@@ as and his family were the first in Achaia to have faith in the Lord . They have done all they can for God's people . My friends , I ask you 
to obey leaders like them and to do the same for all others who work hard with you . 
I was glad to see Steph@@ an@@ as and For@@ tun@@ a@@ tus and A@@ cha@@ i@@ cus . Ha@@ ving them here was like having you . 
They made me feel much better , just as they made you feel better . You should app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate people like them . 
 Greetings from the churches in Asia . Aquila and Priscilla , together with the church that meets in their house , send greetings in the name of the Lord . 
All the Lord's followers send their greetings . Give each other a warm greeting . 
I am sig@@ ning this letter my@@ self@@ : PAUL . 
I pray that God will put a curse on everyone who doesn't love the Lord . And may the Lord come soon . 
I pray the Lord Jesus will be kind to you . 
I love everyone who belongs to Christ Jesus . 
 My friends , we want you to know that the churches in Macedonia have shown others God's gift of undeserved grace . 
Although they were going through hard times and were very poor , they were glad to give generously . 
They gave as much as they could af@@ for@@ d and even more , simply because they wanted to . 
They even asked and begged us to let them have the joy of giving their money for God's people . 
And they did more than we had hoped . They gave themselves first to the Lord and then to us , just as God wanted them to do . 
Titus was the one who got you started doing this good thing , so we begged him to help you finish what you had be@@ gu@@ n . 
You do everything better than anyone else . You have stronger faith . You speak better and know more . You are eager to give , and you love us better . Now you must give more generously than anyone else . 
I am not or@@ der@@ ing you to do this . I am simply testing how real your love is by com@@ par@@ ing it with the concern that others have shown . 
You know our Lord Jesus Christ treated us with undeserved grace by giving up all his riches , so you could become rich . 
A year ago you were the first ones to give , and you gave because you wanted to . So listen to my advice . 
I think you should finish what you started . If you give according to what you have , you will prove you are as eager to give as you were to think about giving . 
It doesn't matter how much you have . What matters is how much you are willing to give from what you have . 
I am not trying to make life easier for others by making life harder for you . But it is only fair 
for you to share with them when you have so much , and they have so little . Later , when they have more than enough , and you are in need , they can share with you . Then everyone will have a fair share , 
 just as the Scriptures say , Those who gathered too much had nothing left . Those who gathered only a little had all they needed . 
I am grateful that God made Titus care as much about you as we do . 
When we begged Titus to visit you , he said he would . He wanted to because he cared so much for you . 
With Titus we are also sending one of the Lord's followers who is well known in every church for spreading the good news . 
The churches chose this follower to travel with us while we carry this gift that will bring praise to the Lord and show how much we hope to help . 
We don't want anyone to find fault with the way we hand@@ le your generous gift . 
 But we want to do what pleases the Lord and what people think is right . 
We are also sending someone else with Titus and the other follower . We app@@ ro@@ ve of this man . In fact , he has already shown us many times that he wants to help . And now he wants to help even more than ever , because he tru@@ sts you so much . 
Titus is my partner , who works with me to serve you . The other two followers are sent by the churches , and they bring honor to Christ . 
Treat them in such a way that the churches will see your love and will know why we bra@@ g@@ ged about you . 
My friends , you are spiritual . So if someone is trapped in sin , you should gen@@ tly lead that person back to the right path . But watch out , and don't be tempted yourself . 
You obey the law of Christ when you offer each other a helping hand . 
If you think you are better than others , when you really aren't , you are wrong . 
Do your own work well , and then you will have something to be proud of . But don't compare yourself with others . 
We each must carry our own load . 
S@@ har@@ e every good thing you have with anyone who teaches you what God has said . 
You cannot fool God , so don't make a fool of yourself ! You will harvest what you plant . 
If you follow your selfish desires , you will harvest destruction , but if you follow the Spirit , you will harvest eternal life . 
Don't get tired of helping others . You will be rewarded when the time is right , if you don't give up . 
We should help people whenever we can , especially if they are followers of the Lord . 
You can see what big letters I make when I write with my own hand . 
Those people who are telling you to get circumcised are only trying to show how important they are . And they don't want to get into trouble for preaching about the cross of Christ . 
They are circumcised , but they don't obey the Law of Moses . All they want is to brag about having you circumcised . 
But I will never brag about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . Because of his cross , the world is dead as far as I am concerned , and I am dead as far as the world is concerned . 
It doesn't matter if you are circumcised or not . All that matters is that you are a new person . 
If you follow this rule , you will belong to God's true people . God will treat you with undeserved kindness and will bless you with peace . 
 On my own body are scar@@ s that prove I belong to Christ Jesus . So I don't want anyone to bother me anymore . 
My friends , I pray that the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you ! Amen . 
 Children , you belong to the Lord , and you do the right thing when you obey your parents . The first commandment with a promise says , 
 Obey your father and your mother , 
and you will have a long and happy life . 
 Parents , don't be hard on your children . Ra@@ ise them properly . Teach them and instruct them about the Lord . 
 Slaves , you must obey your earthly masters . Show them great respect and be as loyal to them as you are to Christ . 
Try to please them at all times , and not just when you think they are watching . You are slaves of Christ , so with your whole heart you must do what God wants you to do . 
G@@ la@@ dly serve your masters , as though they were the Lord himself , and not simply people . 
You know that you will be rewarded for any good things you do , whether you are slaves or free . 
 Sla@@ ve owners , you must treat your slaves with this same respect . Don't threa@@ ten them . They have the same Master in heaven that you do , and he doesn't have favorites . 
Finally , let the mighty strength of the Lord make you strong . 
 Put on all the armor that God gives , so you can defend yourself against the dev@@ il@@ 's tri@@ cks . 
We are not fighting against humans . We are fighting against forces and authorities and against rulers of darkness and powers in the spiritual world . 
So put on all the armor that God gives . Then when that evil day comes , you will be able to defend yourself . And when the battle is over , you will still be standing firm . 
 Be ready ! Let the truth be like a belt around your waist , and let God's justice protect you like armor . 
 Your desire to tell the good news about peace should be like sho@@ es on your feet . 
Let your faith be like a shi@@ eld , and you will be able to stop all the flaming ar@@ ro@@ ws of the evil one . 
 Let God's saving power be like a hel@@ met , and for a sword use God's message that comes from the Spirit . 
Never stop praying , especially for others . Always pray by the power of the Spirit . Stay alert and keep praying for God's people . 
Pray that I will be given the message to speak and that I may f@@ ear@@ l@@ ess@@ ly explain the mystery about the good news . 
I was sent to do this work , and this is the reason I am in jail . So pray that I will be brave and will speak as I should . 
I pray that God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will give peace , love , and faith to every follower ! 
May God be kind to everyone who keeps on loving our Lord Jesus Christ . 
 From Paul and Timothy , servants of Christ Jesus . To all God's people who belong to Christ Jesus at Philippi and to all your b@@ is@@ ho@@ ps and dea@@ c@@ ons . 
I pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to you and will bless you with peace ! 
Every time I think of you , I thank my God . 
And whenever I mention you in my prayers , it makes me happy . 
This is because you have taken part with me in spreading the good news from the first day you heard about it . 
God is the one who began this good work in you , and I am certain that he won't stop before it is complete on the day that Christ Jesus returns . 
You have a special place in my heart . So it is only natural for me to feel the way I do . All of you have helped in the work God has given me , as I defend the good news and tell about it here in jail . 
God himself knows how much I want to see you . He knows I care for you in the same way Christ Jesus does . 
I pray that your love will keep on growing and you will fully know and understand 
how to make the right cho@@ ices . Then you will still be pure and innocent when Christ returns . And until that day , 
Jesus Christ will keep you bus@@ y doing good deeds that bring glory and praise to God . 
My dear friends , I want you to know that what has happened to me has helped to spread the good news . 
 The Roman guards and all the others know I am here in jail because I serve Christ . 
Now most of the Lord's followers have become brave and are f@@ ear@@ l@@ ess@@ ly telling the message . 
Some are preaching about Christ because they are jealous and en@@ vi@@ ous of us . Others are preaching because they want to help . 
They love Christ and know I am here to defend the good news about him . 
But the ones who are jealous of us are not sincere . They just want to cause trouble for me while I am in jail . 
But that doesn't matter . All that matters is that people are telling about Christ , whether they are sincere or not . This is what makes me glad . I will keep on being glad , 
because I know that your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Christ Jesus will keep me safe . 
I honestly expect and hope I will never do anything to be ashamed of . Whether I live or die , I always want to be as brave as I am now and bring honor to Christ . 
If I live , it will be for Christ , and if I die , I will gain even more . 
I don't know what to choose . I could keep on living and doing something useful . 
It is a hard cho@@ ice to make . I want to die and be with Christ , because this would be much better . 
Then , when I visit you again , you will have good reason to take great pride in Christ Jesus because of me . 
Above all else , you must live in a way that brings honor to the good news about Christ . Then , whether I visit you or not , I will hear that all of you think alike . I will know that you are working together and are struggling side by side to get others to believe the good news . 
Be brave when you face your enemies . Your courage will show them that they are going to be destroyed , and it will show you that you will be saved . God will make all of this happen , 
and he has blessed you . Not only do you have faith in Christ , but you suffer for him . 
 You saw me suffer , and you still hear about my troubles . Now you must suffer in the same way . 
Christ encoura@@ ges you , and his love comfor@@ ts you . God's Spirit un@@ it@@ es you , and you are concerned for others . 
Now make me completely happy ! Live in har@@ mon@@ y by showing love for each other . Be united in what you think , as if you were only one person . 
Don't be jealous or proud , but be humble and consider others more important than yourselves . 
C@@ are about them as much as you care about yourselves 
and think the same way that Christ Jesus thought@@ :
Christ was truly God . But he did not try to remain equal with God . 
Instead he gave up everything and became a slave , when he became like one of us . 
Christ was humble . He obeyed God and even died on a cross . 
Then God gave Christ the highest place and honored his name above all others . 
 So at the name of Jesus everyone will bow down , those in heaven , on earth , and under the earth . 
And to the glory of God the Father everyone will openly agree , Jesus Christ is Lord ! 
My dear friends , you always obeyed when I was with you . Now that I am away , you should obey even more . So work with fear and trembling to discover what it really means to be saved . 
God is working in you to make you willing and able to obey him . 
Do everything without grumbling or arguing . 
 Then you will be the pure and innocent children of God . You live among people who are crooked and evil , but you must not do anything they can say is wrong . Try to shine as lights among the people of this world , 
as you hold firmly to the message that gives life . Then on the day when Christ returns , I can take pride in you . I can also know that my work and e@@ f@@ for@@ ts were not useless . 
Your faith in the Lord and your service are like a sacrifice offered to him . And my own blood may have to be poured out with the sacrifice . If this happens , I will be glad and rejo@@ ice with you . 
In the same way , you should be glad and rejo@@ ice with me . 
I want to be encouraged by news about you . So I hope the Lord Jesus will soon let me send Timothy to you . 
I don't have anyone else who cares about you as much as he does . 
The others think only about what in@@ ter@@ ests them and not about what concer@@ ns Christ Jesus . 
But you know what kind of person Timothy is . He has worked with me like a son in spreading the good news . 
I hope to send him to you , as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me . 
And I feel sure the Lord will also let me come soon . 
I think I ought to send my dear friend Epaph@@ ro@@ di@@ tus back to you . He is a follower and a worker and a soldier of the Lord , just as I am . You sent him to look after me , 
but now he is eager to see you . He is worried , because you heard he was sick . 
In fact , he was very sick and almost died . But God was kind to him , and also to me , and he kept me from being bur@@ d@@ ened down with sorrow . 
Now I am more eager than ever to send Epaph@@ ro@@ di@@ tus back again . You will be glad to see him , and I won't have to worry any longer . 
Be sure to give him a cheerful welcome , just as people who serve the Lord deserve . 
He almost died working for Christ , and he risked his own life to do for me what you could not . 
I want you to know what a struggle I am going through for you , for God's people at Laodicea , and for all of those followers who have never met me . 
I do it to encourage them . Then as their hearts are joined together in love , they will be wonder@@ fully blessed with complete understanding . And they will truly know Christ . Not only is he the key to God's mystery , 
but all wisdom and knowledge are hidden away in him . 
I tell you these things to keep you from being fooled by fancy talk . 
Even though I am not with you , I keep thinking about you . I am glad to know that you are living as you should and your faith in Christ is strong . 
You have accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord . Now keep on following him . 
P@@ l@@ ant your roots in Christ and let him be the foundation for your life . Be strong in your faith , just as you were taught . And be grateful . 
Don't let anyone fool you by using senseless arguments . These arguments may sound wise , but they are only human teachings . They come from the powers of this world and not from Christ . 
God lives fully in Christ . 
And you are fully grown because you belong to Christ , who is over every power and authority . 
Christ has also taken away your selfish desires , just as circumc@@ is@@ ion re@@ mo@@ ves flesh from the body . 
 And when you were baptized , it was the same as being buried with Christ . Then you were raised to life because you had faith in the power of God , who raised Christ from death . 
 You were dead , because you were sinful and were not God's people . But God let Christ make you alive , when he forgave all our sins . 
 God wiped out the charges that were against us for disobeying the Law of Moses . He took them away and nailed them to the cross . 
There Christ defeated all powers and forces . He let the whole world see them being led away as prisoners when he celebrated his victory . 
 Don't let anyone tell you what you must eat or drink . Don't let them say you must celebrate the New Mo@@ on festival , the Sabbath , or any other festival . 
These things are only a shadow of what was to come . But Christ is real ! 
Don't be cheated by people who make a show of acting humble and who worship angels . They brag about seeing visions . But it is all nonsense , because their minds are filled with selfish desires . 
 They are no longer part of Christ , who is the head of the whole body . Christ gives the body its strength , and he uses its jo@@ ints and m@@ us@@ c@@ les to hold it together , as it grows by the power of God . 
You died with Christ . Now the forces of the universe don't have any power over you . Why do you live as if you had to obey such rules as , 
Don't hand@@ le this . Don't taste that . Don't touch this . ? 
After these things are used , they are no longer good for anything . So why be bothered with the rules that humans have made up ? 
Obe@@ ying these rules may seem to be the smart thing to do . They appear to make you love God more and to be very humble and to have control over your body . But they don't really have any power over our desires . 
Finally , our friends , please pray for us . This will help the message about the Lord to spread quickly , and others will respect it , just as you do . 
Pray that we may be kept safe from worthless and evil people . After all , not everyone has faith . 
But the Lord can be trusted to make you strong and protect you from harm . 
He has made us sure that you are obeying what we taught you and that you will keep on obeying . 
I pray that the Lord will guide you to be as loving as God and as patient as Christ . 
My dear friends , in the name of the Lord Jesus , I beg you not to have anything to do with any of your people who loa@@ f around and refuse to obey the instructions we gave you . 
You surely know that you should follow our example . We didn't waste our time lo@@ af@@ ing , 
and we didn't accept food from anyone without paying for it . We didn't want to be a burden to any of you , so night and day we worked as hard as we could . 
We had the right not to work , but we wanted to set an example for you . 
We also gave you this ru@@ le@@ : If you don't work , you don't eat . 
Now we learn that some of you just loa@@ f around and won't do any work , except the work of a busy@@ body . 
So , for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ , we ask and beg these people to settle down and start working for a living . 
Dear friends , you must never become tired of doing right . 
Be on your guard against any followers who refuse to obey what we have written in this letter . Put them to shame by not having anything to do with them . 
Don't consider them your enemies . Instead , speak k@@ in@@ dly to them as you would to any other follower . 
I pray that the Lord , who gives peace , will always bless you with peace . May the Lord be with all of you . 
I always sign my letters as I am now do@@ ing@@ : PAUL . 
I pray that our Lord Jesus Christ will be kind to all of you . 
My friends , we should not all try to become teachers . In fact , teachers will be judged more strictly than others . 
 All of us do many wrong things . But if you can control your tongue , you are mature and able to control your whole body . 
By putting a bit into the mouth of a horse , we can turn the horse in different directions . 
It takes strong winds to move a large sailing ship , but the captain uses only a small ru@@ d@@ der to make it go in any direction . 
Our tongues are small too , and yet they brag about big things . It takes only a spar@@ k to start a for@@ est fire ! 
 The tongue is like a spar@@ k . It is an evil power that dir@@ ties the rest of the body and sets a person@@ 's enti@@ re life on fire with flames that come from hell itself . 
All kinds of animals , birds , reptiles , and sea creatures can be ta@@ med and have been ta@@ med . 
But our tongues get out of control . They are res@@ tless and evil , and always spreading deadly pois@@ on . 
Can clean water and dirty water both f@@ low from the same spr@@ ing ? 
Can a fig tree produce o@@ lives or a gra@@ p@@ ev@@ ine produce figs ? Does fresh water come from a well full of salt water ? 
 Are any of you wise or sensible ? Then show it by living right and by being humble and wise in everything you do . 
But if your heart is full of bitter jeal@@ ou@@ sy and self@@ ish@@ ness , don't brag or lie to cover up the truth . 
This kind of wisdom doesn't come from above . It is earthly and selfish and comes from the devil himself . 
Whenever people are jealous or selfish , they cause trouble and do all sorts of cruel things . 
But the wisdom that comes from above leads us to be pure , friendly , gentle , sensible , kind , helpful , genuine , and sincere . 
When peace@@ ma@@ kers plant seeds of peace , they will harvest justice . 
My dear friends , this is the second letter I have written to encourage you to do some honest thinking . I don't want you to forget 
what God's prophets said would happen . You must never forget what the holy prophets taught in the past . And you must remember what the apostles told you our Lord and Savior has commanded us to do . 
 But first you must realize that in the last days some people won't think about anything except their own selfish desires . They will make fun of you 
and say , Didn't your Lord promise to come back ? Yet the first leaders have already died , and the world hasn't changed a bit . 
 They will say this because they want to forget that long ago the heavens and the earth were made at God's command . The earth came out of water and was made from water . 
 Later it was destroyed by the waters of a mighty flood . 
But God has commanded the present heavens and earth to remain until the day of judgment . Then they will be set on fire , and ungodly people will be destroyed . 
 Dear friends , don't forget that for the Lord one day is the same as 1 , 000 years , and 1 , 000 years is the same as one day . 
The Lord isn't slow about keeping his promises , as some people think he is . In fact , God is patient , because he wants everyone to turn from sin and no one to be lost . 
 The day of the Lord's return will surprise us like a thief . The heavens will disappear with a loud noise , and the heat will m@@ elt the whole universe . Then the earth and everything on it will be seen for what they are . 
Everything will be destroyed . So you should serve and honor God by the way you live . 
You should look forward to the day when God judges everyone , and you should try to make it come soon . On that day the heavens will be destroyed by fire , and everything else will m@@ elt in the heat . 
 But God has promised us a new heaven and a new earth , where justice will rule . We are really looking forward to this ! 
My friends , while you are waiting , you should make certain the Lord finds you pure , spotless , and living at peace . 
Don't forget that the Lord is patient because he wants people to be saved . This is also what our dear friend Paul said when he wrote you with the wisdom God had given him . 
Paul talks about these same things in all his letters , but part of what he says is hard to understand . Some ignorant and un@@ stea@@ dy people even destroy themselves by twi@@ sting what he said . They do the same thing with other Scriptures too . 
My dear friends , you have been warned ahead of time ! So don't let the er@@ r@@ ors of evil people lead you down the wrong path and make you lose your b@@ al@@ ance . 
Let the gift of undeserved grace and the understanding that come from our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ help you keep on growing . Praise Jesus now and forever ! Amen . 
 The Word that gives life was from the beginning , and this is the one our message is about . Our ears have heard , our eyes have seen , and our hands have touched this Word . 
 The one who gives life appeared ! We saw it happen , and we are witnesses to what we have seen . Now we are telling you about this eternal life that was with the Father and appeared to us . 
We are telling you what we have seen and heard , so you may share in this life with us . And we share in it with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ . 
We are writing to tell you these things , because this makes us truly happy . 
Jesus told us God is light and doesn't have any darkness in him . Now we are telling you . 
If we say we share in life with God and keep on living in the dark , we are lying and are not living by the truth . 
 But if we live in the light , as God does , we share in life with each other . And the blood of his Son Jesus wa@@ shes all our sins away . 
If we say we have not sinned , we are fooling ourselves , and the truth isn't in our hearts . 
But if we conf@@ ess our sins to God , he can always be trusted to forgive us and take our sins away . 
If we say we have not sinned , we make God a liar , and his message isn't in our hearts .
