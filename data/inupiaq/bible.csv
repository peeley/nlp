0," During the time of the judges there was a famine in the land of Judah. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah went to live as a resident foreigner in the region of Moab, along with his wife and two sons. ","Qaŋasaaq, Israel umialgiñŋaan, niqaiḷḷiuŋarut tamaani nunami.

1," (Now the man’s name was Elimelech, his wife was Naomi, and his two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were of the clan of Ephrath from Bethlehem in Judah.) They entered the region of Moab and settled there. ","Elimelech tuquŋaruq, aasii Naomi kisiŋŋuŋagaa igñitiglu malġuk, "
2," Sometime later Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, so she and her two sons were left alone. ","nuliaŋaruak Moab-miugnik aġnagnik, Orpah-miglu Ruth-miglu. Qulit ukiut qaaŋianigmata "
3, So her sons married Moabite women. (One was named Orpah and the other Ruth.) And they continued to live there about ten years. ,"Mahlon-lu Chilion-lu tuquŋammiuk, aasii Naomi kisiŋŋuŋagaat, uiŋatalu iġñiŋiksalu."
4," Then Naomi’s two sons, Mahlon and Kilion, also died. So the woman was left all alone – bereaved of her two children as well as her husband! ",Naomi tusaamaruq Ataniġmun ikayuġnivḷugich iñuni nauriaŋich naupkaqługich; tavraasii itqanaiyaŋaruq aullaġukłuni Moab-miñ ukuagni kaluġlugik 
5," So she decided to return home from the region of Moab, accompanied by her daughters-in-law, because while she was living in Moab she had heard that the Lord had shown concern for his people, reversing the famine by providing abundant crops. ","Aullaŋarut atautchikun utiqsaqłutik Judah-mun, aglaan iglaullaġmik "
6," Now as she and her two daughters-in-law began to leave the place where she had been living to return to the land of Judah, ","uqallautiŋagaik, “Utiġusik aakavsigñiitchaqtuaġitchik. Atanġuptuq nakuugutilisik ilivsik nakuugutimmatun uvaŋalu taipkualu tuquŋaruat. "

22,May the Lord punish me severely if I do not keep my promise!,
23,Only death will be able to separate me from you!” ,
24," When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to dissuade her. ",
25, So the two of them journeyed together until they arrived in Bethlehem.,
26,"When they enteredBethlehem, the whole village was excited about their arrival. The women of the village said, “Can this be Naomi?” ",
27," But she replied to them, “Don’t call me ‘Naomi’! Call me ‘Mara’ because the Sovereign One has treated me very harshly. ",
28," I left here full, but the Lord has caused me to return empty-handed. Why do you call me ‘Naomi,’ seeing that the Lord has opposed me, and the Sovereign One has caused me to suffer?” ",
29," So Naomi returned, accompanied by her Moabite daughter-in-law Ruth, who came back with her from the region of Moab. (Now they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.)",
30," Now Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side of the family named Boaz. He was a wealthy, prominent man from the clan of Elimelech. ","Naomi iḷaqaġniqsuq atiqaqtuamik Boaz-mik, umialgumaruq suli iñuich naalaġnisuumagaat, nanmiñiq iḷagimagaa Naomi-m tuvaaqataata Elimelech-gum. "
31," One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields so I can gather grain behind whoever permits me to do so.” Naomi replied, “You may go, my daughter.” ","Uvlut iḷaŋanni Ruth-gum uqallautiniġaa Naomi, “Nauriaqaġvigmuglaŋa pukugiaġluŋa palauvaksranik unisaŋiññik pukuktuat.

32," So Ruth went and gathered grain in the fields behind the harvesters. Now she just happened to end up in the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was from the clan of Elimelech.","Tavraasii Ruth nauriaqaġvigmuŋaruq aasii pisuagaqsivḷuni aquatigun savaktuat, pukukłuni palauvaksranik tamauŋa uniñŋaraŋiññik.

35," The servant in charge of the harvesters replied, “She’s the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the region of Moab. ","Aŋutim kiugaa, “Taaganiġmiu Moab-miñ qairuaq Naomi piqatigivlugu. "
36," She asked, ‘May I follow the harvesters and gather grain among the bundles?’ Since she arrived she has been working hard from this morning until now – except for sitting in the resting hut a short time.”","Apiġiraani maliġiyumiñaġmagaaġmi aquatigun pukuktuat pukugukhuni palauvaksranik.

39," Ruth knelt before him with her forehead to the ground and said to him, “Why are you so kind and so attentive to me, even though I am a foreigner?” ","Ruth puttuq kiiñamiñik aksikł̣ugu nuna, aasii uqallakhuni Boaz-mun, “Summan uvva isumaalugiviŋa? Summan uvva nakuugutiviŋa aaniġmiuguruaŋaa?”"
40," Boaz replied to her, “I have been given a full report of all that you have done for your mother-in-law following the death of your husband – how you left your father and your mother, as well as your homeland, and came to live among people you did not know previously. ","Boaz-gum kiugaa, “Tusaaŋagitka iluqaisa piŋaratin aakaruaġnun tuvaaqatin qaŋa tuqumman.

41," May the Lord reward your efforts! May your acts of kindness be repaid fully by the Lord God of Israel, from whom you have sought protection!” ",Atanġumtuq akiḷiusiaksriḷḷisin piŋarakkun. Atanġum God-iŋata Israel naamaruamik akiḷiusiaqaqtillisin ullaŋagapku ilaa qaunagitquvlutin!”

43," Later during the mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come here and have some food! Dip your bread in the vinegar!” So she sat down beside the harvesters. Then he handed her some roasted grain. She ate until she was full and saved the rest. ","Niġiñaqsimman Boaz-gum uqallautigaa Ruth, “Qaiḷutin punniqtuġiñ kiñisaaġutin.” Tavraasii aquptaaqasiŋagaich savaktit aasii Boaz-gum aitchuŋagaa iliktitanik palauvaksranik.

47," She carried it back to town, and her mother-in-law saw how much grain she had gathered. Then Ruth gave her the roasted grain she had saved from mealtime. ","Naomi-m apiġigaa, “Sumi pukukpigich ukua palauvaksrat uvlupak? Kia nauriaqaġviani savakpich? God-imtuq ikayuġliuŋ aŋun iliŋnik ikayuiruaq!”"
48," Her mother-in-law asked her, “Where did you gather grain today? Where did you work? May the one who took notice of you be rewarded!” So Ruth told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. She said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.” ",Ruth-gum uqallautigaa Naomi savagnivḷuni nauriaqaġviani aŋutim atiqaqtuam Boaz-mik.
49," Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be rewarded by the Lord because he has shown loyalty to the living on behalf of the dead!” Then Naomi said to her, “This man is a close relative of ours; he is our guardian.” ","“Atanġum quviasaaġliuŋ Boaz!” Naomi uqallaktuq nipatuvluni. “Atanġum piiguyuitkai unniqsuqłiiŋakami iñuuruanullu tuquŋaruanullu.” Uqallavsaaqtuq, “Taamna aŋun nanmiñiq iḷagigikpuk, iḷauruq tamatkunuŋa qaunaksriksrautigiraptignun.”"

51," Naomi then said to her daughter-in-law Ruth, “It is good, my daughter, that you should go out to work with his female servants. That way you will not be harmed, which could happen in another field.” ","Naomi-m uqallautigaa Ruth, “Aaŋ, paniiŋ, iluałhaaġniaqtuq pukukkuvich aġnani savaktuani Boaz-gum nauriaqaġviŋiññi. Piyuaqpiaġaatin pukugiaġuvich allam nauriaqaġviŋanun.” "
52," So Ruth worked beside Boaz’s female servants, gathering grain until the end of the barley harvest as well as the wheat harvest. After that she stayed home with her mother-in-law.",Tavraasii Ruth-gum savaqasiŋagaich pukukhuni palauvaksranik naatchiḷġataqtiłługich. Tavra iñuuniaqatigiŋagaasuli aakaruani.
53," At that time, Naomi, her mother-in-law, said to her, “My daughter, I must find a home for you so you will be secure. ","Ikpaksraaġulimman Naomi-mim uqallautigaa Ruth, “Uiksraġnik uvva paqittuksrauruŋa, ilikkulli aimaaġviñikkumautin. "
54," Now Boaz, with whose female servants you worked, is our close relative. Look, tonight he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor. ","Itqaumalutin taamna Boaz, aġnanik savaktiqaqtuaq savaqatigiraġnik, iḷagigikpuk. Naalaġniŋŋa. Unnuksraaqpan amma palauvaksrat katagaalatchiñiaġaich. "
55," So bathe yourself, rub on some perfumed oil, and get dressed up. Then go down to the threshing floor. But don’t let the man know you’re there until he finishes his meal.

56," When he gets ready to go to sleep, take careful notice of the place where he lies down. Then go, uncover his legs, and lie down beside him. He will tell you what you should do.” ",Sumun nallaqtilaaŋa naipiqtuqsaġiñ aasii siquanikpan uliŋich makpiġḷugich nallaqsaqtutin isigaŋiññun. Uqallautiniaġaatin sutqugumisin.”

59," When Boaz had finished his meal and was feeling satisfied, he lay down to sleep at the far end of the grain heap. Then Ruth crept up quietly, uncovered his legs, and lay down beside him.

60, In the middle of the night he was startled and turned over. Now he saw a woman lying beside him! ,"Unnuaġruiññakun itiniqłaŋaruq, mumiŋaruq, aasii tupaŋaruq tautukkamiuŋ aġnaq nalaruaq isigamiñi. "
61," He said, “Who are you?” She replied, “I am Ruth, your servant. Marry your servant, for you are a guardian of the family interests.” ",“Kiñailvich?” apiġigaa.
62," He said, “May you be rewarded by the Lord, my dear! This act of devotion is greater than what you did before. For you have not sought to marry one of the young men, whether rich or poor. ","“Ruth uvaŋa, aŋuun,” Ruth-gum kiugaa. “Nanmiñiq iḷagikapkiñ, qaunagiruksraġigiŋma. Tavraasii katinŋa.”"
63," Now, my dear, don’t worry! I intend to do for you everything you propose, for everyone in the village knows that you are a worthy woman.

65," Remain here tonight. Then in the morning, if he agrees to marry you, fine, let him do so. But if he does not want to do so, I promise, as surely as the Lord lives, to marry you. Sleep here until morning.” ","Iḷumun ittuq nanmiñiq iḷautilaamnik iliŋnun suli qaunagiruksraġitilaaġnik uvaŋa, aglaan imma aŋun ittuq iliŋnun iḷaułhaaqtuaq uvamniñ. "
66," So she slept beside him until morning. She woke up while it was still dark. Boaz thought, “No one must know that a woman visited the threshing floor.” ",Tavraniittin unnuapak aasii uvlaami iḷitchuġisaġniaqtuguk ilaanun qaunagisugmagaaqpich.

67," Then he said, “Hold out the shawl you are wearing and grip it tightly.” As she held it tightly, he measured out about sixty pounds of barley into the shawl and put it on her shoulders. Then he went into town, ","Tavraasii nalaŋaruq isigaŋiññi, aglaan makinŋaruq qaummaġiksianiŋaiñŋaan tautugnaqsiḷuni qanukkii Boaz-gum iḷitchuġitquŋił̣ł̣ugich iñuich tavraniinŋatilaaŋanik. "

72, The following events happened in the days of Ahasuerus. (I am referring to that Ahasuerus who used to rule over a hundred and twenty-seven provinces extending all the way from India to Ethiopia.) ,"Umialguvianiñ Persia-m iniqpaŋani Susa-m, Umialgum Xerxes-gum atanniqsimaŋagai 127 nunaqpaich, India-miñ aullaqivḷutik Ethiopia-muaglaan."
73," In those days, as King Ahasuerus sat on his royal throne in Susa the citadel, ","Piŋayuanni ukiut umialguvianni niqinaqiutiŋagai atanaurani suli piraksriqsuqtiŋit qaukłiŋi umialgum.

74," in the third year of his reign he provided a banquet for all his officials and his servants. The army of Persia and Media was present, as well as the nobles and the officials of the provinces. ",Naalġataqługi itchaksrani tatqich piraksriqsuqtiŋit manivanŋagai suġaliñi atanniqsuqtamiñi irvigmiñi qanutun qiññaġiksigiruat suli aliuġnaqtuat.
75," He displayed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor of his majestic greatness for a lengthy period of time – a hundred and eighty days, to be exact!

76," When those days were completed, the king then provided a seven-day banquet for all the people who were present in Susa the citadel, for those of highest standing to the most lowly. It was held in the court located in the garden of the royal palace. ","Umialgum irviata siḷataani qiñiyunaqutiqaŋaruq talukiyaaqaqhuni suŋauraaqtaanik suli qatiqtaanik ukił̣haanik, qiḷiġviqaqhuni tigluuraaqtaanik ukił̣haanik qivliaqtaanik tigummiviqaqhutik maapumik ayagutiligaanik.

77," The furnishings included linen and purple curtains hung by cords of the finest linen and purple wool on silver rings, alabaster columns, gold and silver couches displayed on a floor made of valuable stones of alabaster, mother-of-pearl, and mineral stone. ","Imġutiŋich qallugaurat savaaguŋammiut manigñik kaviqsuaniñ, allakaaġiiḷḷaavlutik, suli iḷaŋaniiqsinŋammigaich umialgum wine-gutimiñik. "

79," There were no restrictions on the drinking, for the king had instructed all of his supervisors that they should do as everyone so desired. ","Taimmaliasii, umialgum igluqpaŋani tuvaaqataata Vashti-m niqinaqiutiqpaŋagaich aġnat."

81," On the seventh day, as King Ahasuerus was feeling the effects of the wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who attended him, ","Piraksriŋagai umialgum qaġġisitquvlugu tuvaaqatini Vashti, niaquġutiqaġlugu.

82," to bring Queen Vashti into the king’s presence wearing her royal high turban. He wanted to show the people and the officials her beauty, for she was very attractive. ","Tavraasii kivgami uqallautimmanni Vashti piraksriutaagun umialgum, kamaksriŋaitchuq. Tavra umialik qinnalipiaġataŋaruq."
83," But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s bidding conveyed through the eunuchs. Then the king became extremely angry, and his rage consumed him.","Piḷġusiġiŋagaa umialgum apiqsriyumiñaqłuni pitquraliqiriñun qanuq pitquraġlu suli piraksriun inniaġmagaan, tavraasii ququaŋagai siḷġiqsuqtini, iḷisimaniaġmata qanuq piraksrautilaamiñik. "
84, The king then inquired of the wise men who were discerners of the times – for it was the royal custom to confer with all those who were proficient in laws and legalities. ,"Tavra saasuŋaiññaġuuraŋi siḷġiqsuqtini ukua Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, suli Memucan------tallimat malġuuruat atanaurauruat Persia-miḷu Mediam-miḷu qutchigñiqsraŋi atanaurauruat umialgunmiñi. "
85," Those who were closest to him were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan. These men were the seven officials of Persia and Media who saw the king on a regular basis and had the most prominent offices in the kingdom. ","Uqallautiŋagaich tavra taapkua inna, “Uvaŋa, Umialik Xerxes, tiliŋagitka kivgatka tuvaaqatimnun Vashti-mun piraksriutimnik, aasiuvva kamaksrisuŋitchuq! Qanuq aasiimma pitquraq itpa qanuġniaqtilaaptignik ilaagun?”"
86," The king asked, “By law, what should be done to Queen Vashti in light of the fact that she has not obeyed the instructions of King Ahasuerus conveyed through the eunuchs?”",Tavra Memucan uqallaŋaruq kaŋiqsiñaqsipiaġataqługu umialigmun suli atanauraŋiññun inna: “Tuvaaqataata umialgum Vashti-m pisaaŋapiaġataŋagaa umialik atanauraŋiḷḷu---tavraami iluqaaqługiḷḷu aŋutipayaallu umialgutaani taputigaich! 
87," Memucan then replied to the king and the officials, “The wrong of Queen Vashti is not against the king alone, but against all the officials and all the people who are throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus. ","Aġnapayaam tavra umialgutimni tuvaaqatini anmukturraqsiñiaġaa tusaagumik qanuq umialgum tuvaaqataa pitilaaŋa. Inna uqaġmiḷutik, ‘Umialgum Xerxes-gum piraksriŋagaluaġaa tuvaaqatini Vashti ullaquvluni, aasii kamaksriŋaitchuq.’ "
88," For the matter concerning the queen will spread to all the women, leading them to treat their husbands with contempt, saying, ‘When King Ahasuerus gave orders to bring Queen Vashti into his presence, she would not come.’ ","Tavra tuvaaqatauruat umialgum atanauraŋisa Persia-mlu Media-mlu tusaagumiŋ irrusianik umialgum tuvaaqataata, uqausiġiniaġaat tuvaaqatimignun taamna piruaq uvluq nuŋuŋaunnagu. Tuvaaqatauruat sumipayaaq qiksiksrautaiġñiaqtut uimigñun, suli uiguruat qinnautiniaġaich nuliatik. "
89," And this very day the noble ladies of Persia and Media who have heard the matter concerning the queen will respond in the same way to all the royal officials, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger! ","Iviġaumagigupku umialguruatiin, manisiiñ kiliktuunmik Vashti suuramik-unnii sivuġaanutqikkumiñaiġḷugu umialgum. Aglaktillugulu pitquraġuġlugu Persia-mi Media-miḷu, allaŋŋuġumiñaipiaġataġlugu. Taimmaasii umialgum tuvaaqataa inaŋiqsillugu nakuulhaaqtuamik aġnamik. "
90," If the king is so inclined, let a royal edict go forth from him, and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media that cannot be repealed, that Vashti may not come into the presence of King Ahasuerus, and let the king convey her royalty to another who is more deserving than she. ","Tavraasii kiliktuun nalupqinaiġanikpan iluqaanun umialgutiqpagnun, aġnapayaurat qiksikkun uimignun aturraqsiñiaġaat, umialgugaluaqpan naakka iḷiappaugaluaqpan.”"
91," And let the king’s decision which he will enact be disseminated throughout all his kingdom, vast though it is. Then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the most prominent to the lowly.”","Umialgum suli atanauraŋisa iviġaumagiŋagaat taamna sivunniutaat, aasii umialgum taŋŋiqsinŋagaa piraksriutaa Memucan-gum. "
92, The matter seemed appropriate to the king and the officials. So the king acted on the advice of Memucan. ,"Nunaaqqiḷḷaanun atanniqsimaruanun tuyuŋaruq uqautchiŋisiktun suli aglausiatitun nunaaqqiḷḷaam, ugallautivlugi; piraksriqł̣ugi uigupayauraqtuaq qaukłiunivḷugu aimaaġvimiñi suli uqaġumiñaġuni ataniġnaqutiqaġuni."
93," He sent letters throughout all the royal provinces, to each province according to its own script and to each people according to its own language, that every man should be ruling his family and should be speaking the language of his own people.",
94," When these things had been accomplished and the rage of King Ahasuerus had diminished, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decided against her. ","Aquvatigun, umialgum qinnautaa qasupayaaġaluaġmanunnii, isumaaluutigirraqsiŋagaa Vashti-m piḷġusia suli kiliktuutini paaqłakługu Vashti. "
95," The king’s servants who attended him said, “Let a search be conducted in the king’s behalf for attractive young women. ","Tavraasii iḷaŋich umialgum siḷġiqsuqtiŋisa qanittuat ilaanun apiqsriŋarut inna, “Summan imña ivaqłiqtitchisuŋitpich aŋusiuŋaitchuanik aġnaġiksuanik niviaqsianik? "
96," And let the king appoint officers throughout all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the attractive young women to Susa the citadel, to the harem under the authority of Hegai, the king’s eunuch who oversees the women, and let him provide whatever cosmetics they desire. ","Tilisiyumiñaqtutin atanauranik nunaqpauruapayaani atanniqsuqtaġni aasii qaġġisipkaġlugich taapkua aġnaġiksuat niviaqsiat aġnautikpich inaannun uvani Susa-mi, iniqpauruami. Hegai-mun qaunagitquvlugich, igruiyaqtaq qaunaksrauruaq aġnautignun, aasii timiŋich qiññaġiksaaqtillugich. "
97," Let the young woman whom the king finds most attractive become queen in place of Vashti.” This seemed like a good idea to the king, so he acted accordingly.",Taimmaasii niviaqsiaq iviġaumaginiġupku tuvaaqasiutilugu inaŋiutauluni Vashti-mun.”
98," Now there happened to be a Jewish man in Susa the citadel whose name was Mordecai. He was the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjaminite, ","Umialgum tavra iviġaumagiŋagaa siḷġiqsuutaat, aasii maliġuaqługu."
99," who had been taken into exile from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried into exile with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile. ",Tavrani Susa-mi iñuuŋaruq Jew-guruaq Mordecai iġñiŋa Jair-m; kaŋiqaqhuni kiŋuniiŋiñiñ Benjamin-gum suli kiŋunġuvluni Kish-mun Shimei-mullu. 
100," Now he was acting as the guardian of Hadassah (that is, Esther), the daughter of his uncle, for neither her father nor her mother was alive. This young woman was very attractive and had a beautiful figure. When her father and mother died, Mordecai had raised her as if she were his own daughter.","Tavra Umialgum Nebuchadnezzar-m Babylon-mium tiguŋagaa Umialik Jehoiachin Judah--ġmiuq tigutaaqługuasii Jerusalem-miñ, iḷagivḷugi allat tigutaaqtat, iḷauŋammiñiqsuq Mordecai. "
101," It so happened that when the king’s edict and his law became known many young women were taken to Susa the citadel to be placed under the authority of Hegai. Esther also was taken to the royal palace to be under the authority of Hegai, who was overseeing the women. ","Aññaqaŋaniqsuq Esther-mik, Hebrew-tun atiqaqhuni Hadassah-mik; aġnaġikpaŋaruq niviaqsiaq, qiññaġigmivḷuni. Tuqummagnik aŋayuqaaŋik, Mordecai-m tiguaŋaniġaa aasii iñuguqługu panigmisun."
102," This young woman pleased him, and she found favor with him. He quickly provided her with her cosmetics and her rations; he also provided her with the seven specially chosen young women who were from the palace. He then transferred her and her young women to the best quarters in the harem.","Tavra umialgum manimmauŋ kiliktuun iñiqtatchaurani suli niviaqsiaġayaat qaġġirraummata Susa-mun, Esther iḷagiŋagaat. Ilaaptauq inillaŋammigaat umialgum iniqpaŋanun qaunaksriliqł̣ugich Hegai-mik, qaukłiuvluni iglumi inaanni. "
103," Now Esther had not disclosed her people or her lineage, for Mordecai had instructed her not to do so. ","Hegai-m nakuaġiŋagaa Esther, suli iviġaumanaqłuni ilaanun. Tavrauvvaa qiniyunaqsarrasiŋagaa timiŋa qiġġaiyaqtiłługu nanukługu suli niqiqaqtiłługu iłuaqtuanik timaanun. Inillagmivḷugu nakuuniqsramik inimik aġnat inaanni suli qaunaksriḷiġmivḷugu tallimat malġugnik niviaqsianik naliġaaguŋaruanik umialgum irvianiñ."
104, And day after day Mordecai used to walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem in order to learn how Esther was doing and what might happen to her.,"Tavra siḷġiqsuutaagun Mordecai-m, Esther-m iriqtaġiŋagaa Jew-guruagutilaani. "
105," At the end of the twelve months that were required for the women, when the turn of each young woman arrived to go to King Ahasuerus – for in this way they had to fulfill their time of cosmetic treatment: six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with perfume and various ointments used by women – ","Uvlutuaġman Mordecai pisuaġaqtuq utiqtaqhuni aniiġaaġvium siḷataani umialgum iniŋani, iḷisimasukługu qanuqitilaaŋalu suniaġmagaallu Esther."
106, the woman would go to the king in the following way: Whatever she asked for would be provided for her to take with her from the harem to the royal palace. ,"Qiññaġiksaġniŋat timiŋiññun aġnat ukiuq naalġataqlugu piraqtuq nanukługi timitik myrrh-m uqsruŋanik itchaksrani tatqiñi suli uqsruŋanik balsam itchaksravsaani tatqiñi. Taaptuma aquagun, aġnallaam ullallaaraġniġaa Umialik Xerxes. "
107," In the evening she went, and in the morning she returned to a separate part of the harem, to the authority of Shaashgaz the king’s eunuch who was overseeing the concubines. She would not go back to the king unless the king was pleased with her and she was requested by name.","Tavra aġnaq anikami aġnat inaanniñ aasii umialgum igluqpaŋanukhuni, annuġaaqtuġaqtuq isumamisun. "
108," When it became the turn of Esther daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai (who had raised her as if she were his own daughter) to go to the king, she did not request anything except what Hegai the king’s eunuch, who was overseer of the women, had recommended. Yet Esther met with the approval of all who saw her. ","Aġnaq aullaqiraqtuq unnuksraaġman, aasii uvlaakumman aullatiraġigaat allamun aġnat inaannun qaunaksriḷiqł̣ugu Shaashgaz-mik, eunuch qaunaksriruaq umialgum nuliaŋisa tugliŋiññik. Aġnaq ullautivsaayuiñmiuq umialigum kisian piqpagikkamiuŋ apiqsruusiġivlugu atqagun."
109," Then Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus at his royal residence in the tenth month (that is, the month of Tebeth) in the seventh year of his reign. ","Piviksraq tikiñŋaruq Esther-m ullautiniksraŋanun umialigmun. Esther, paniŋa Abigail-gum suli aññaġivlugu Mordecai-m, tiguaŋavlu panigiruatun; Esther piññaġiraġigaat iñuich tautukkamirruŋ. Tavra tikiñman piviksrani, Hegai-m, eunuch-guruam, qaunaksriruam aġnat inaanni, nalġautiŋagaa atiraksraŋanik. "
110," And the king loved Esther more than all the other women, and she met with his loving approval more than all the other young women. So he placed the royal high turban on her head and appointed her queen in place of Vashti. ","Tavraasii Xerxes tallimat malġugni umialguanigman, tatqich quliŋanni Tebeth-gum, Esther qaġġisuutiŋagaat Umialik Xerxes-gum igluqpaŋanun. "
111," Then the king prepared a large banquet for all his officials and his servants – it was actually Esther’s banquet. He also set aside a holiday for the provinces, and he provided for offerings at the king’s expense.","Umialgum nakuaġiłhaaŋagaa allaniñ aġnaniñ, suli allasalagniñ akuqtuaġiŋagaa nakuaġivlugulu. Umialgum kamanaqtuamik niaquġusiŋagaa suli tuvaaqatiliutivlugu inaŋiqł̣ugu Vashti. "
112," Now when the young women were being gathered again, Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate. ",Tavraasii umialgum niqinaqutiqpaŋagaa Esther qutchiksiḷiqługu suli aiyuġaaġmivḷugi iluqaisa ataniġnaqutiqaqtuallu qaukłiiḷḷu. Tutinmivḷugu uvluq savaŋaiqsiłługich iñuich iluqaani umialgunmiñun suli aitchuqtuimivḷuni akisurualugnik aitchuimmatun umialigmun.
113," Esther was still not divulging her lineage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her. Esther continued to do whatever Mordecai said, just as she had done when he was raising her.",Tavra Mordecai inillaŋagaa umialgum qaukłiŋŋuqługu. 
114," In those days while Mordecai was sitting at the king’s gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who protected the entrance, became angry and plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus. ","Tavraliasii Esther-m, iḷisimapkaŋaitkaich iñuich Jew-gutilaamiñik. Mordecai-m uqallautiŋavlugu kiliktuitquŋił̣ł̣ugu, aasii kamagiŋagaa taaptumuuna, tainnatuttauq kamaksriutimisun qaunagisuummani aġnaiyaaguŋŋaġmi."
115," When Mordecai learned of the conspiracy, he informed Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in Mordecai’s behalf. ","Taimani Mordecai qaukłiġñi iḷaupkaqługu umialgum iniqpaŋani, Bigthana-lu Teresh-lu, malġuk umialgum igruiyaqtak qaunaksrik inauraŋiññun umialgum, pimaqłuktarraqsiŋaniġaak Umialik Xerxes aasii sivunniurraqsivḷutik tuqutchukługu. "
116," The king then had the matter investigated and, finding it to be so, had the two conspirators hanged on a gallows. It was then recorded in the daily chronicles in the king’s presence.","Mordecai tavra iḷitchuġiniqsuq aasii uqallautivlugu umialgum tuvaaqataa Esther, taimmaasii kilikługu umialik tusaaraŋanik Mordecai-m. "
117," Some time later King Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, exalting him and setting his position above that of all the officials who were with him. ","Aquvatigun Umialik Xerxes-gum inillagniġaa qutchiksuamun savaamun iñuk atiqaqtuaq Haman-mik aullarriġuqługu nunamignun. Haman iġñiġuvluni Hammedatha-mun, kiŋunġuvluni Agag-mun. "
118," As a result, all the king’s servants who were at the king’s gate were bowing and paying homage to Haman, for the king had so commanded. However, Mordecai did not bow, nor did he pay him homage.","Umialgum piraksriŋagai ataniġnaqutiqapayauraqtuat savaktauruat ilaanun qiksiksrautiqaquvlugi Haman-mun quvsugvigitqulugu suli purvigilugu. Iluqaġmiŋ kamaksriŋarut, kisiŋŋuqługu Mordecai, kamaksrisuŋił̣ł̣uni. "
119," Then the servants of the king who were at the king’s gate asked Mordecai, “Why are you violating the king’s commandment?” ",Allat ataniġnaqutiqaqtuat umialgum savaktiŋisa apiqsruŋagaat summan kamaksrisuŋiñmagaan umialgum piraksriutaanik; 
120," And after they had spoken to him day after day without his paying any attention to them, they informed Haman to see whether this attitude on Mordecai’s part would be permitted. Furthermore, he had disclosed to them that he was a Jew.","uvlutuaġaġimman kiiqsruġaluaġaġigaat, aglaan naalaġniŋaitkai. “Uvaŋauvaŋa Jew-guruŋa,” ilaan uqallautiraġigai, “purvigiyumiñaitkiga Haman.” Tavra uqallautiŋagaat Haman taaptumuuna, isumalaaġutigivlugu manimmisiqaġniaġmagaan Mordecai-m piḷġusianik. "
121," When Haman saw that Mordecai was not bowing or paying homage to him, he was filled with rage. ","Haman tavra qinnalipiaġataŋaruq puttuqsrikami Mordecai-m sitquġviginiaŋisimammani naakka purvigiluni, "
122," But the thought of striking out against Mordecai alone was repugnant to him, for he had been informed of the identity of Mordecai’s people. So Haman sought to destroy all the Jews (that is, the people of Mordecai) who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus.","tavraasii iḷitchuġikami Mordecai Jew-gutilaaŋanik, sivunniŋaruq tatavsaqsiññaġuŋił̣ł̣ugu Mordecai kisian. Tavra sivunniiŋaruq tuqutchukługi Jew-gupayauraqtuat iluqaani Persia-m Umialgutaani."
123," In the first month (that is, the month of Nisan), in the twelfth year of King Ahasuerus’ reign, pur (that is, the lot) was cast before Haman in order to determine a day and a month. It turned out to be the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar).","Qulit malġugni ukiiganigman Umialguvluni Xerxes, sivulliġmi tatqimi, Nisan tatqiŋani, Haman piraksriiŋaruq saaptaquvlugi (“purim-nik,” taiguutiqaqtuat) qakugu uvlumi suli tatqimi taŋŋiġukługu taamna sivunniuġutini. Qulit piŋasuanni uvlut qulit malġuŋanni tatqich, tatqiŋani Adar-m, sivunniutigiŋagaat."
124," Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, “There is a particular people that is dispersed and spread among the inhabitants throughout all the provinces of your kingdom whose laws differ from those of all other peoples. Furthermore, they do not observe the king’s laws. It is not appropriate for the king to provide a haven for them. ","Tavra uqallautiŋagaa Haman-gum umialik inna, “Imma iñuuniaqatigiiksuat iñuich siammaġaaŋarut atanniqsimmavigñi paqinnaqhutiglu sumiḷiqaa.

125," If the king is so inclined, let an edict be issued to destroy them. I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to be conveyed to the king’s treasuries for the officials who carry out this business.”","Iviġaumagigupku Umialiik, piraksriigguiñ pitquramik tuqutautqulugi. Tainna piguvich, nalupqinaitchuami iksriyumiñaqtuŋa 375 tons-tun manigñik qatiqtuanik iksraqaġvigñun aŋalanniŋagun ataniġnaqutikpich.”"
126," So the king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, who was hostile toward the Jews. ","Umialġum tavra piiŋagaa qitiqłiaġutini, titiġutigisuurani kiliktuutinun suli nalupqinaipiallakługu, aasii qaił̣ł̣ugu akiḷḷiŋiññun Jew-guruat, Haman-mun iġñiġuruaq Hammedatha-mun, kiŋunġuvluni Agag-mun. "
127," The king replied to Haman, “Keep your money, and do with those people whatever you wish.”","Umialgum ukallautiŋagaa, “Iñuiḷḷu maniŋiḷḷu ilivich piutitin; qanupayaaq isumaktun aŋalatki.”"
128," So the royal scribes were summoned in the first month, on the thirteenth day of the month. Everything Haman commanded was written to the king’s satraps and governors who were in every province and to the officials of every people, province by province according to its script and people by people according to its language. In the name of King Ahasuerus it was written and sealed with the king’s signet ring. ","Tavraasii uvlut qulit piŋasuanni sivulliġmi tatqimi Haman-gum ququaŋagai umialgum aglaktiŋi suli aglakhutik kiliktuunmik mumiquvlugu uqautchipayaatigun suli aglagniŋisigun atuqtaŋisigun umialgum atanniqsimavianni suli tuyuutigitquvlugu iluqaiññun atanaurauruanun, kavanauruanun, suli ataniġnaqutiqaqtuanun. Kiliktuun siamitauŋaruq atqagun Umialgum Xerxes suli titiŋavluni qitikłiaġutaanik. "
129," Letters were sent by the runners to all the king’s provinces stating that they should destroy, kill, and annihilate all the Jews, from youth to elderly, both women and children, on a particular day, namely the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), and to loot and plunder their possessions. ","Aqpatit taamna umialgum kiliktuutaa aanŋagaat inipayauramun umialgum atanniqsimmaviani.

Tuquġaaksraunivḷugich naglikkutaiḷaakun suli suġauttaŋich piññaktaaġilugich. "
130," A copy of this edict was to be presented as law throughout every province; it was to be made known to all the inhabitants, so that they would be prepared for this day. ","Uqaluŋich taapkua kiliktuutim manirauruksrauŋarut nunaaqqiḷḷaanun, nalupqinaitchuami iñupayaaq itqanaitquvlugu taamna uvluq tikitpan."
131," The messengers scurried forth with the king’s order. The edict was issued in Susa the citadel. While the king and Haman sat down to drink, the city of Susa was in an uproar!","Umialgum piraksriutaagun taamna pitquraq manirauŋaruq iniqpaŋani Susa-m, suli aqpatit iḷisimapkaiŋarut tusaayugaamik nunaaqqipayaanun. Umialig-lu Haman-lu aquptaaġataqhutik imiŋaruk imma iniqpaŋani Susa-m tuavaalapkaqługich."
132," Now when Mordecai became aware of all that had been done, he tore his garments and put on sackcloth and ashes. He went out into the city, crying out in a loud and bitter voice. ","Tavra Mordecai iḷitchuġikami tamattumuuna piruakun, ilaan alikturraqsiŋagai annuġaani qinnautikun. Tavraasii annuġaaŋaruq miitchugnik, nanukługulu niaquni aġramik, aasii pisuaġaqsivḷuni iġialavluni nipatutilauramisun uumiḷuġrukpaghuni, "
133," But he went no further than the king’s gate, for no one was permitted to enter the king’s gate clothed in sackcloth. ",tikiḷġataqhuni sivuġaanun umialgum upkuaqpaŋata. Isiŋiñmiuq qanukkii iñuk miitchugnik annuġaaqaqtuaq isiġumiñaił̣ł̣uni. 
134," Throughout each and every province where the king’s edict and law were announced there was considerable mourning among the Jews, along with fasting, weeping, and sorrow. Sackcloth and ashes were characteristic of many. ","Nunaqpauruani, sumipayaaq umialgum kiliktuutaa nalupqinaiġman, nipatuvlutik qiññutiqaqpaŋarut Jew-guruat. Niġiŋaiḷaŋarut, qiaŋarut, iġialaŋarut, suli iñugiałhaaqtuat miitchugnik annuġaaŋarut suli nallaġutivlutik aġranun."
135," When Esther’s female attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her about Mordecai’s behavior, the queen was overcome with anguish. Although she sent garments for Mordecai to put on so that he could remove his sackcloth, he would not accept them. ","Tavraasii Esther-m aġnat kivgaŋisa suli Eunuch-guruat qaunaksrich kiligmanni qanuq Mordecai pisilaaŋanik, iluiḷḷiqpaŋaruq. Tuyuŋagaa Mordecai annuġaanik atiraksraŋiññik miitchuuŋitchuanik, aglaan akuqtuŋaitkai. "
136," So Esther called for Hathach, one of the king’s eunuchs who had been placed at her service, and instructed him to find out the cause and reason for Mordecai’s behavior. ","Tavraasii ququaŋagaa Hathach, iḷaŋat umialgum eunuch-guruat kivgaksriutaa ilaanun, suli uqallautivlugu ullaquvlugu Mordecai iḷitchuġiyaqtuquvlugu suna imma pimmagaan summallu. "
137, So Hathach went to Mordecai at the plaza of the city in front of the king’s gate. ,Hathach-gum ullaŋagaa Mordecai iniqpaum sivuġaaniittuaq upkuapaŋata umialgum irviata. 
138," Then Mordecai related to him everything that had happened to him, even the specific amount of money that Haman had offered to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews to be destroyed. ",Mordecai-m kiliktuŋagaa supayaanik piruanik ilaagun suli qanutun manigñik Haman unniqsuqłiitilaaŋanik ikusiñiksraŋanun umialgum manigñik tutquġviŋiññun iluqaisa Jew-gupayauraqtuat tuqutaukpata. 
139, He also gave him a written copy of the law that had been disseminated in Susa for their destruction so that he could show it to Esther and talk to her about it. He also gave instructions that she should go to the king to implore him and petition him on behalf of her people. ,"Ilaan qaiñŋagaa Hathach-mun maqpiġaaq kiliktuun siaminŋaruaq Susa-mi, suksraunġiksauniksraŋatigun Jew-guruat.

140, So Hathach returned and related Mordecai’s instructions to Esther.,"Hathach kamaksriŋaruq, "
141, Then Esther replied to Hathach with instructions for Mordecai: ,suli Esther qaitchiŋaruq tuyuunmik utqutitquvlu Mordecai-mun: 
142," “All the servants of the king and the people of the king’s provinces know that there is only one law applicable to any man or woman who comes uninvited to the king in the inner court – that person will be put to death, unless the king extends to him the gold scepter, permitting him to be spared. Now I have not been invited to come to the king for some thirty days!”","“Imma iñuk, aŋun naakka aġnaq, isiġiaqpan umialgum igluata siḷataanun aasii tautuglugu umialik qaitquŋaiñŋaġmi, taamna iñuk tuquruksrauruq.

143," When Esther’s reply was conveyed to Mordecai, ","Tavra Mordecai-m akuqtuqamiuŋ Esther-m tuyuutaa, "
144, he said to take back this answer to Esther: ,ilaan kiuŋagaa kiliktuutigillaan: “Isumanakunnii annaksimaałhaaġnasugalutin allaniñ Jew-guruaniñ innivaiḷḷutin umialgum igluqpaŋani. 
145," “Don’t imagine that because you are part of the king’s household you will be the one Jew who will escape. If you keep quiet at this time, liberation and protection for the Jews will appear from another source, while you and your father’s household perish. It may very well be that you have achieved royal status for such a time as this!”","Nipaisaaġuvich taaptumuuna piviksrakun apqusaaqtaptigun, ikayuun qaiñiaqtuq qiḷagmiñ Jew-guruanun, aasii annaurraulutiŋ, aglaan ilvich tuquniaqtutin suli aapakpich iḷaŋich isukłiññiaġmiut.

146, Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: ,Esther-m kiuniġaa Mordecai inna: 
147," “Go, assemble all the Jews who are found in Susa and fast in my behalf. Don’t eat and don’t drink for three days, night or day. My female attendants and I will also fast in the same way. Afterward I will go to the king, even though it violates the law. If I perish, I perish!”","“Aullaġlutin atautchimuktitchaġitin Jew-gupayauraqtuat Susa-mi; niġiŋaiḷaqsaqtusi aŋaiyyutigiluŋalu.

148, So Mordecai set out to do everything that Esther had instructed him.,Mordecai tavra aullaŋaruq savaaġiqqaaqługi supayaurat Esther-m piraksriutaagun.
149," It so happened that on the third day Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner court of the palace, opposite the king’s quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the palace, opposite the entrance. ","Piŋayuanni uvlut niġiŋaiḷaġniġmiñi Esther-m atiŋagai umialguniġmiñi qaliġuani aasii aullaqikami qikaġiaŋaruq iḷulliġmi umialgum iniqpaŋata, saanŋavlugu inauraq umialgum aquppivia. Umialik isiġmiuŋaruq, aquppiutaqpamiñi aquppivḷuni, saanŋavlugu isiġiaq. "
150," When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she met with his approval. The king extended to Esther the gold scepter that was in his hand, and Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.","Tavra umialgum tautukkamiuŋ tuvaaqatini, Esther qikaqtuaq siḷataani, iviġaumagiŋagaa, aasii tuŋaaġivlugu ilaa isaaġutiŋagaa kaviqsuamik manigmik savaaq. Esther-m tavra mayuqhuni aksiŋagaa nuvua tikkuaġutim. "
151," The king said to her, “What is on your mind, Queen Esther? What is your request? Even as much as half the kingdom will be given to you!” ","“Suvich imña, Tuvaaqatiiŋ Esther?” umialgum apiqsruġaa. “Uqallautiŋŋa sumik piqaġuktilaaġnik, aasii qaiññiaġiga ilignun--avvaġigaluaqpauŋ unnii nunam atanniqsimaraġma.”"
152," Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet that I have prepared for him.” ","Esther-m kiuŋagaa, “Iviġaumagigupku umialiik, uvva iliviḷḷu Haman-lu tuyuġmiaġisukkivsik anaqakpan niqinaqutiksriukkamnun ilivsigñun.”"
153," The king replied, “Find Haman quickly so that we can do as Esther requests.”","Umialgum tavra piraksriŋagaa Haman akkupapiaġataq qaitquvlugu, tuyuġmiagusaqhutik Esther-mun. Tavra umialiglu Haman-lu aullaqiŋaruk Esther-m niqinaqusiaŋanun. "
154,So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared. ,"Wine-tuġaallaġmik umialgum apiqsruŋagaa, “Uqallautiŋŋa sumik piqaġuktilaaġnik, tavra piginiaġiñ. Aitchuutiginiaġiga apiqsrian, apiqsrigaluaġuvich unnii avvaŋanik atanniġsimaraġma nunam.”"
155," While at the banquet of wine, the king said to Esther, “What is your request? It shall be given to you. What is your petition? Ask for as much as half the kingdom, and it shall be done!”","Esther-m kiugaa, "
156," Esther responded, “My request and my petition is this: ","“Umialiik nagliksraġumiñaġuvich akuqtuġumiñaġlugu apiqqutiga, uvva ilviḷḷu Haman-lu tuyuġmiaġisukkivsik uvlaaku niqinaqutivsaaġukłusik itqanaiyaapkun. Tavra tavrani uqallautiniaġivsik suqaġuktilaamnik.”"
157," If I have found favor in the king’s sight and if the king is inclined to grant my request and perform my petition, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the banquet that I will prepare for them. At that time I will do as the king wishes.","Tavra Haman animman niqinaqusiqiruaniñ quviasuŋaruq uqiġyuummiqł̣uniḷu.

158," Now Haman went forth that day pleased and very much encouraged. But when Haman saw Mordecai at the king’s gate, and he did not rise nor tremble in his presence, Haman was filled with rage toward Mordecai. ",Aglaan manimmisiqaŋaruq aasii aivḷuni. Tavrani aiyugaaŋagai avilaitqatini aimmavigmiñun aasii apiġivlugu tuvaaqatini Zeresh iḷautquvlugu. 
159, But Haman restrained himself and went on to his home.,"Uqavigaaŋaruq iliŋiññun qanutun umialgutilaamiñik, qavsiñiglu iġñiqaġnivḷuni, qanuġlu umialgum qutchiksuamun savaamun inillaŋatilaamiñik, suli nuimaruagułhaaqtilaamiñik allaniñ umialgum atanauraŋiññiñ. "
160,"He then sent for his friends to join him, along with his wife Zeresh. ","“Taamnatualuuŋiñmiuq,” Haman uqaqtuq, “Umialgum tuvaaqataata, Esther-m niqinaqusiuqpagmivḷunuk kisimnuuraq umialiglu uvaŋalu, aasiuvva aiyugaaqtauvsaaŋalgitchuguk uvlaaku. "
161," Haman then recounted to them his fabulous wealth, his many sons, and how the king had magnified him and exalted him over the king’s other officials and servants. ",Aglaan uvva suunnauŋitchuq taamna uvamnun qanukkii Jew-guruaq Mordecai aquppiugaqtuq isiġiaŋani umialgum igluqpaŋata.”
162," Haman said, “Furthermore, Queen Esther invited only me to accompany the king to the banquet that she prepared! And also tomorrow I am invited along with the king. ","Tavraasii tuvaaqataatalu avilaitqatiŋisalu piyumisaaŋagaat, “Summan imña nappaisuŋitpich pimaqłuktuat qimirviksraŋannik piŋasukipiaq akimiatun isigagniqaqtuamik qutchiksigilugu?

163, Yet all of this fails to satisfy me so long as I have to see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.”,"Haman-gum isumalluataġnasugiŋagai, tavraasii nappaipqaqługi qimitchivigmik."
164," Haman’s wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, “Have a gallows seventy-five feet high built, and in the morning tell the king that Mordecai should be hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet contented.”",
165,"It seemed like a good idea to Haman, so he had the gallows built.",
166," Throughout that night the king was unable to sleep, so he asked for the book containing the historical records to be brought. As the records were being read in the king’s presence, ","Tavrani unnuami umialik siqullaiŋaruq, tavraasii umialgutaata maqpiġaaqpaŋi qaġġisipkaŋagai aasii taiguaġutipkaqłuni. "
167," it was found written that Mordecai had disclosed that Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s eunuchs who guarded the entrance, had plotted to assassinate King Ahasuerus.","Iḷaŋa taiguaqtaŋata iḷaqaŋaruq kiliktuunmik qanuq iḷitchuġitilaaŋa Mordecai sivunniuġutaatigun tuqutchukługu umialik— Bigthana-vlu Teresh-guvlu sivunniuġutaak, malġuk umialgum igluqpaŋani Eunuch-guruak qaunaksrik inauraŋiññik. "
168," The king asked, “What great honor was bestowed on Mordecai because of this?” The king’s attendants who served him responded, “Not a thing was done for him.”","Umialik apiġsriŋaruq, “Qanuq qutchiksiḷiqługu akiḷiñŋavisigu Mordecai taaptumuuna?”"
169," Then the king said, “Who is that in the courtyard?” Now Haman had come to the outer courtyard of the palace to suggest that the king hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had constructed for him. ","Kivgaŋisa kiuŋagaat, “Sumik anniqsuŋaitkikput ilaa.”"
170," The king’s attendants said to him, “It is Haman who is standing in the courtyard.” The king said, “Let him enter.”",“Immaipkua ataniġnaqutilgich maaniitpat igluqpamni?” umialik apiqsriruq.
171," So Haman came in, and the king said to him, “What should be done for the man whom the king wishes to honor?” Haman thought to himself, “Who is it that the king would want to honor more than me?” ",Tavra Haman isiqqammiŋaruq umialgum igluqpaŋata siḷataanun; qaiŋaniqsuq apiġiyyaqługu umialik qimitquvlugu Mordecai qimitchiviksriukkaŋannun. 
172," So Haman said to the king, “For the man whom the king wishes to honor, ","Tavra kivgaŋisa kiuŋagaat, “Haman qaiŋaruq, utaqqiruq tautugukhutin.”"
173, let them bring royal attire which the king himself has worn and a horse on which the king himself has ridden – one bearing the royal insignia! ,"“Isiqtitchiuŋ,” uqallaktuq umialik."
174," Then let this clothing and this horse be given to one of the king’s noble officials. Let him then clothe the man whom the king wishes to honor, and let him lead him about through the plaza of the city on the horse, calling before him, ‘So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!’”","Tavra Haman isiŋaruq, aasii umialgum uqallautiŋagaa, “Imma iñuk isummatigipiaġataġiga kamanaqsiḷiġukługu. Suutiniaqsimavigu taamna iñuk?”"
175," The king then said to Haman, “Go quickly! Take the clothing and the horse, just as you have described, and do as you just indicated to Mordecai the Jew who sits at the king’s gate. Don’t neglect a single thing of all that you have said.”","Haman isumallaktuq inmiñun, “Immaimña kiña umialgum kamanaqsiḷiġułhaaġmivaun? Uvaŋauruq, nalupqinaitchuami.”"
176," So Haman took the clothing and the horse, and he clothed Mordecai. He led him about on the horse throughout the plaza of the city, calling before him, “So shall it be done to the man whom the king wishes to honor!” ","Tavraasii kiuŋagaa umialik, “Umialgum qaliġuaŋi qaġġisilich taaptumuŋa iñugmun qaliġuat atuġuuratin. Qiñiyunaqusiqmiḷugu ilvich tuttuqpaiñ. "
177," Then Mordecai again sat at the king’s gate, while Haman hurried away to his home, mournful and with a veil over his head. ","Tavraasii iḷaŋata Qutchigñiqsrauruam umialignaqpich annuġaaqsaġaa taapkuniŋa qaliġuaġnik aasii aullatilugu, kakaksiġḷuni tuttuqpagmik, iniqpaum katirvikpaŋani.

178," Haman then related to his wife Zeresh and to all his friends everything that had happened to him. These wise men, along with his wife Zeresh, said to him, “If indeed this Mordecai before whom you have begun to fall is Jewish, you will not prevail against him. No, you will surely fall before him!” ","Tavra umialgum uqallautiŋagaa Haman, “Qilamik isagiakki qaliġuat suli tuttuqpak, aasii nanġausiaqaqtillugu Mordecai Jew-guruaq.

179," While they were still speaking with him, the king’s eunuchs arrived. They quickly brought Haman to the banquet that Esther had prepared.","Tavra Haman-gum aiŋagai qaliġuallu tuttuqpaglu, aasii qaliġuaqługu Mordecai.

180, So the king and Haman came to dine with Queen Esther. ,"Umialgum tuvaaqataata Esther-m kiuŋagaa, “Iviġaumagigupku umialikpauruatiin akuqtuġumiñaqugiga qiñuiqł̣uŋa apiġsriaġa, piyummatigigigauvva iñuusukłuŋa suli iñutka iñuutquvlugi. "
181," On the second day of the banquet of wine the king asked Esther, “What is your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted to you. And what is your petition? Ask up to half the kingdom, and it shall be done!” ","Iñutkaluuvva uvaŋalu tunirauŋarugut tuqutautquvluta.

182," Queen Esther replied, “If I have met with your approval, O king, and if the king is so inclined, grant me my life as my request, and my people as my petition. ","Tavra Umialgum Xerxes-gum apiġiŋagaa Esther, “Kiñauvaimña piyumisaaqłiqpa tainnasimik? Imma nauŋ taamna iñuk?”"
183," For we have been sold – both I and my people – to destruction and to slaughter and to annihilation! If we had simply been sold as male and female slaves, I would have remained silent, for such distress would not have been sufficient for troubling the king.”","Esther-m kiuŋagaa, “Uvagut akiḷḷiqput, nagliksaaqtitchiruaq uvaptinnik, taamnauruq pigiipiaġataqtuaq iñuk Haman!” Haman-gum sanmivḷugik umialig-lu tuvaaqataalu iqsitchalipiallaŋaruq. "
184," Then King Ahasuerus responded to Queen Esther, “Who is this individual? Where is this person to be found who is presumptuous enough to act in this way?”","Umialik maksriŋaruq qinnaliqpaił̣ł̣uni, anivḷuniasii, aasii iniqpaum nautchiaqaġvianukłuni.

186,Then Haman became terrified in the presence of the king and queen. ,Umialik uqallaanigluqqaaqtuq Eunuch-gich matuŋagaat Haman-gum niaqua. 
187," In rage the king arose from the banquet of wine and withdrew to the palace garden. Meanwhile, Haman stood to beg Queen Esther for his life, for he realized that the king had now determined a catastrophic end for him.","Tavra iḷaŋat, atiqaqtuaq Harbonah-mik, uqallaŋaruq, “Haman qaaŋiulaaqhuniunnii nappaiŋaruq qimitchivigmik iglumiñi qimitchukługu Mordecai, taamna annaurriruaq umialikpaum iñuggutaanik.

188," When the king returned from the palace garden to the banquet of wine, Haman was throwing himself down on the couch where Esther was lying. The king exclaimed, “Will he also attempt to rape the queen while I am still in the building!”",“Niviŋŋaqsiuŋ Haman taaptumuŋa!” umialik piraksriiruq.
189,"As these words left the king’s mouth, they covered Haman’s face. ",Tavra Haman qimisauŋaruq qimitchiviḷiakkaluamiñi Mordecai-mun. Tavraasii umialgum qinnautaa qasupayaaqhuni.
190," Harbona, one of the king’s eunuchs, said, “Indeed, there is the gallows that Haman made for Mordecai, who spoke out in the king’s behalf. It stands near Haman’s home and is seventy-five feet high.”",
191,"The king said, “Hang him on it!” ",
192, So they hanged Haman on the very gallows that he had prepared for Mordecai. The king’s rage then abated.,
193," On that same day King Ahasuerus gave the estate of Haman, that adversary of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Now Mordecai had come before the king, for Esther had revealed how he was related to her. ","Taaptumani uvlumi Umialgum Xerxes-gum qaiñŋagai Esther-mun suġaliŋi Haman-gum, akiḷḷiŋat Jew-guruat. Esther-m uqallautiŋagaa umialik Mordecai iḷaginivḷugu, tavraŋŋaaglaan aasii Mordecai isiġumiñaqsivḷuni umialgum sivuġaanun. "
194, The king then removed his signet ring (the very one he had taken back from Haman) and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther designated Mordecai to be in charge of Haman’s estate.,Umialik qitiqłiaġutaiŋaruq umialgutaata nalupqinaiyautaanik (Haman-min pitqiŋarani) aasii qaił̣ł̣ugu Mordecai-mun. Esther-m tavra Mordecai qaunaksriliutiŋagaa Haman-gum suġaliŋiññik.
195," Then Esther again spoke with the king, falling at his feet. She wept and begged him for mercy, that he might nullify the evil of Haman the Agagite which he had intended against the Jews. ","Tavraasi Esther-m uqallautivsaaŋagaa umialik, sivuġaanukhuni isigaiññun qiaŋŋaġmi.

196," When the king extended to Esther the gold scepter, she arose and stood before the king. ","Umialgum isaaġutiŋagaa kaviqsuaq manik tikkuaġutini ilaanun, tavraasii Esther makinŋaruq aasii uqallakhuni, "
197," She said, “If the king is so inclined and if I have met with his approval and if the matter is agreeable to the king and if I am attractive to him, let an edict be written rescinding those recorded intentions of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, which he wrote in order to destroy the Jews who are throughout all the king’s provinces. ","“Iviġaumagigupku umialikpauruatiin, piqpaginiġumŋalu suli iłuaqpalliġñiqpan ilignun, siavsisaqtutin kiliktuunmik Haman-gum piraksriutaa taŋŋiqsautquŋił̣ł̣ugu taipkua piraksriutit iġñiŋata Hammedatha-m kiŋunġuruam Agag-mun qaiñŋaraŋi sukraunġiġukługi Jew-gupayauraqtuat iniqpagmi.

198," For how can I watch the calamity that will befall my people, and how can I watch the destruction of my relatives?”","Qanuġlugu taamna igḷutuġumiñaqpigu pimaqłuun tikitpan iñugiramnun, suli nanmiñiq iḷatka tuqutaukpata?” "
199," King Ahasuerus replied to Queen Esther and to Mordecai the Jew, “Look, I have already given Haman’s estate to Esther, and he has been hanged on the gallows because he took hostile action against the Jews. ","Umialik Xerxes uqallaŋaruq Esther-mun Mordecai-mullu, Jew-guruamun, “Uvva niviŋŋaqtinŋagiga Haman sivunniuŋaruaq tuqutchukługi Jew-guruat, suli qaiñmivḷugi Esther-mun suġaliŋi. "
200, Now you write in the king’s name whatever in your opinion is appropriate concerning the Jews and seal it with the king’s signet ring. Any decree that is written in the king’s name and sealed with the king’s signet ring cannot be rescinded.,"Aglaan kiliktuun umialgum atqagun suli titiġlugu titiġutaanik allaŋuġuminaitchuq. Aglaan uvva, aglakkumiñaqtutin Jew-guruanun qanupayauraq; suli aglaaġiyumiñaġiñ atipkuaġlugu suli titiġlugu umialgum titiġutaanik.”"
201," The king’s scribes were quickly summoned – in the third month (that is, the month of Sivan), on the twenty-third day. They wrote out everything that Mordecai instructed to the Jews and to the satraps and the governors and the officials of the provinces all the way from India to Ethiopia – a hundred and twenty-seven provinces in all – to each province in its own script and to each people in their own language, and to the Jews according to their own script and their own language. ","Taamna piŋaruq iñuiññaq piŋasuanni uvlut tatqich piŋayuanni, tatqiŋani Sivan-gum.

202," Mordecai wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king’s signet ring. He then sent letters by couriers on horses, who rode royal horses that were very swift.","Mordecai-m tuyuutit aglaktinŋagai Umialgum Xerxes atqagun, suli titiqługi umialgum nalupqinaiyautaanik. Tavra tuyuutit aattiġirraqsiŋagai sukaruatigun tuttuqpagaqtitigun umialgum tuttuqpaqagviŋiñiñ."
203," The king thereby allowed the Jews who were in every city to assemble and to stand up for themselves – to destroy, to kill, and to annihilate any army of whatever people or province that should become their adversaries, including their women and children, and to confiscate their property. ","Taapkua tuyuutit nalupqinaiŋagaat umialgum piviksritchaqługi Jew-guruat nunaaqqipayaurani itqanaiyaquvlugi sapunniaġunmun.

"
204," This was to take place on a certain day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus – namely, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar). ","Taamna maliġuagaksraq pitquraq isagutiruksrauŋaniqsuq Persia-m Atanniqsimmaviani uvlumi ilaaguaqtauŋaruami tuquġaqtauniksraŋata Jew-guruat, qulit piŋayuanni Adar-m, qulit malġuŋanni tatqich. "
205," A copy of the edict was to be presented as law throughout each and every province and made known to all peoples, so that the Jews might be prepared on that day to avenge themselves from their enemies. ","Iḷisimapkaqtauruksrauŋaruq pitquraġuġlugu suli iḷitchuġipkautauŋaruq iñupayaanun nunaqpauruani, Jew-guruat itqanaitquvlugi akisaġumiñaġlugich akiḷḷitik taamna uvluq tikitpan. "
206, The couriers who were riding the royal horses went forth with the king’s edict without delay. And the law was presented in Susa the citadel as well.,"Umialgum piraksriutaagun tuttuqpagaqtit aullaqiŋarut umialgum tuttuqpaŋisigun sukapiaġataqhutiŋ.

207," Now Mordecai went out from the king’s presence in purple and white royal attire, with a large golden crown and a purple linen mantle. The city of Susa shouted with joy. ","Mordecai aniŋaruq umialgum igluqpaŋaniñ, annuġaaqaqhuni umialgum qaliġuaŋiññik suŋauraaqtaaligaanik suli qatiqtaaligaanik, quppiġaaqaqhuni maptukisuuramik tigluuraaqtaamik ukił̣haamik, suli qiññaġipiaġataqtuamik manigmiñ kaviqsuamiñ piḷiaguruamik niaquġunmik.

208, For the Jews there was radiant happiness and joyous honor. ,"Jew-guruat quviasukpaŋarut suli annapqaułłiŋavlutiŋ, quviasuutiqpaqaqhutiglu, suli akimmatiqaqtuatun iḷiŋarut. "
209," Throughout every province and throughout every city where the king’s edict and his law arrived, the Jews experienced happiness and joy, banquets and holidays. Many of the resident peoples pretended to be Jews, because the fear of the Jews had overcome them.","Inipayauraniḷu suli iniqpapayaurani, sumiḷiqaa umialgum kiliktuutaa taiguaqtaumman, Jew-guruat quviasuutiqpaqaŋarut ilaaguaqtauŋaruami uvlumi niqinaqivlutik suli quviasukpakhutik. Nalupqinaitchuami, iñugiaktuat allat iñuich Jew-guŋarut, qanukkii iqsigiliŋagai Jew-guruat tavraŋŋaaglaan."
210," In the twelfth month (that is, the month of Adar), on its thirteenth day, the edict of the king and his law were to be executed. It was on this day that the enemies of the Jews had supposed that they would gain power over them. But contrary to expectations, the Jews gained power over their enemies. ","Qulit piŋayuanni uvluŋani Adar-m, uvluani umialgum kiliktuutaa nalautirviksrautaani, akiḷḷiŋisa Jew-guruat taaptumani uvlumi isummatigiŋaniġaich iliŋisa aŋalataġisukługich. Aglaan, Jew-guruat akimmatiqaŋaniqsut iliŋiñiñ. "
211," The Jews assembled themselves in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who were seeking their harm. No one was able to stand before them, for dread of them fell on all the peoples. ","Jew-guruat irviŋanni nunaaqqiḷḷaami; umialgum atanniqsimmavianni Jew-guruat itqanaiġutiŋaniqsut aŋuyagukługi iñuich suksraaqsiñialaruat iliŋiññik. Iñuich sumipayaaq iqsigiliŋamagaich, suli kialiqaa paaqłakkumiñaił̣ł̣ugich. "
212," All the officials of the provinces, the satraps, the governors and those who performed the king’s business were assisting the Jews, for the dread of Mordecai had fallen on them. ","Nalupqinaitchuami, iluqaġmiŋ nunaaqqim atanauraŋich — kavanauruat, qaukłiurat, suli umialgum piriŋisa ikayuŋagaich Jew-guruat qanukkii iluqaġmiŋ iqsigivlugu Mordecai. "
213," Mordecai was of high rank in the king’s palace, and word about him was spreading throughout all the provinces. His influence continued to become greater and greater.",Iḷitchuġilluataŋagaat umialgum umialguviani Mordecai kamanaqutiniŋaruaq igluqpaŋani suli kamanautaa nausaiññaqhuni. 
214," The Jews struck all their enemies with the sword, bringing death and destruction, and they did as they pleased with their enemies. ",Tavraasii Jew-guruat isumatuuqhutik aŋalataġiŋagaich akiḷḷitik. Iliŋisa aŋuyaŋagaich savikpamignik suli tuquġaqługich.
215, In Susa the citadel the Jews killed and destroyed five hundred men. ,"Susa-mi, iniqpauruami, Jew-guruat tuqutchiŋarut 500-nik iñugnik. "
216," In addition, they also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, ","Iḷauŋarut qulit iġñiŋi Haman iġñiġuruaq Hammedatha-mun, akiḷḷiŋat Jew-guruat: Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, suli Vaizatha. Tavraaglaan, suġauttaksraqtuŋitchut."
217," Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, ",Taaptumani uvlumi qavsiutilaaŋich iñuich tuqutauruat Susa-mi kilgutauŋarut umialigmun. 
218," Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, ","Tavraasii ilaata uqallautiŋagaa Esther, “Susa-łhiñamiuvva Jew-guruat tuqutchiŋarut 500-nik iñugnik, iḷagivlugi Haman-gum qulit iġñiŋi.

219," the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not confiscate their property. ","Esther-m kiuŋagaa, “Iviġaumagigupku umialikpauruatiin, Jew-guruat Susa-mi uvlaaku pilġusimiktun piyumaut uvlupak. Aasii timiŋich Haman-gum qulit iġñiŋisa niviŋŋaġlugi niviŋŋaviġñun.” "
220, On that same day the number of those killed in Susa the citadel was brought to the king’s attention. ,"Umialgum piraksriŋagai tainna pitquvlugi, aasii iñiqtaksraq kilgutauŋaruq Susa-mi. Timiŋi, qulit iġñiŋisa Haman-gum manirauŋarut tautugnaqsivḷugich. "
221," Then the king said to Queen Esther, “In Susa the citadel the Jews have killed and destroyed five hundred men and the ten sons of Haman! What then have they done in the rest of the king’s provinces? What is your request? It shall be given to you. What other petition do you have? It shall be done.”",Akimiaġutaiḷaŋanni uvluŋisa Adar-m Jew-guruat Susa-mi atautchimuvsaaŋarut aasii tuqutchivsaaqhutik 300-nik iñugnik. Aglaan suli suġauttaksraqtuŋaiḷgitchut.
222," Esther replied, “If the king is so inclined, let the Jews who are in Susa be permitted to act tomorrow also according to today’s law, and let them hang the ten sons of Haman on the gallows.”",Jew-guruat umialgum nunaŋani itqanaiyaŋarut suli sapunniaqhutiŋ inmignun. Suli akiḷḷitik tuquġaŋagaich 75 thousand iñuich uumiksriruat iliŋiññik. Aglaan suġauttaksraqtuŋaitchut. 
223," So the king issued orders for this to be done. A law was passed in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged. ","Taaptuma qulit piŋayuanni uvluŋisa Adar-m piŋarut. Uvlaakumman, akimiaġutaiḷaŋanni uvlut tuquġaiŋaiŋarut, aasii quvianġutigiŋagaat taamna uvluq niqinaqivlutik. "
224," The Jews who were in Susa then assembled on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, and they killed three hundred men in Susa. But they did not confiscate their property.","Aglaan Jew-guruat Susa-mi, akimiaŋanni uvlut nalunaiŋagaat uvluq, qanukkii tuquġaiŋavlutik akiḷḷimignik qulit piŋayuanni uvlut akimiaġutaiḷaŋanni aasii nutqaqłutik akimiaŋanni. "
225," The rest of the Jews who were throughout the provinces of the king assembled in order to stand up for themselves and to have rest from their enemies. They killed seventy-five thousand of their adversaries, but they did not confiscate their property. ","Taaptumuunnaaqhutik Jew-guruat iñuuruat nunaaqqiurani ilaaguaqtaġisuugaat akimiaġutaiḷaq uvluq tatqiŋani Adar-m quviasuutigivlugu taamna uvluq, niqinaqivlutik suli aitchuivḷutik niqinik avanmun."
226, All of this happened on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar. They then rested on the fourteenth day and made it a day for banqueting and happiness.,"Mordecai-m tamatkua igliqtuat aglautipkaŋagai suli tuyuqhuni Jew-gupayauraqtuanun, qanitkaluaġmata naakka uŋasikkaluaġmata, sumulliqaa Persia-m nunaŋani, "
227," But the Jews who were in Susa assembled on the thirteenth and fourteenth days, and rested on the fifteenth, making it a day for banqueting and happiness. ",kiliktuutigivlugu nalunaiquvlugulu akimiaġutailaq suli akimiani uvluni Adar-m nuimaruaġitquvlugu uvluq ukiutuaġaġikpan. 
228," This is why the Jews who are in the rural country – those who live in rural cities – set aside the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a holiday for happiness, banqueting, holiday, and sending gifts to one another.","Taapkunani uvluni Jew-guruat akiḷḷiiġutipiallaŋarut; taaptumanisuli tatqimi mumiŋammiut ipiqtusuutimigniñ tutqiirrutimigñiḷḷu quviasuunmun suli quyyanmun.

229," Mordecai wrote these matters down and sent letters to all the Jews who were throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, ","Tavraasii Jew-guruat maliġuaŋagaich Mordecai-m piraksriutiŋich, suli quviasugvigivlugu taamna ukiutuaġman piḷġusiġirraqsiŋagaat."
230, to have them observe the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the month of Adar each year ,"Haman iġñiŋa Hammedatha-m kiŋunġuruaq Agag-mun suli akiḷḷiuvluni Jew-guruanun nalautchaqsaŋarut (“purim-mik,” taiguutiqaqtuat) inillagukługu uvluq suksraunġiġñiksraŋat Jew-guruat; Haman sivunniŋaruq tamatkiġukługich. "
231," as the time when the Jews gave themselves rest from their enemies – the month when their trouble was turned to happiness and their mourning to a holiday. These were to be days of banqueting, happiness, sending gifts to one another, and providing for the poor.","Aglaan tavra Esther umialigmuŋaruq, aasii umialik aglagnik aullaqtitchiŋaruq piraksriutinik paaqłakługi Haman-gum sivunniutikkaluaŋi pisigivlugi Jew-guruat. Haman-lu iġñiġutiŋiḷu niviŋŋaqtauŋarut qimitchivigmi. "
232, So the Jews committed themselves to continue what they had begun to do and to what Mordecai had written to them. ,"Taamnaasii pisigivlugu uvlut ilaaguaqtauŋarut taiguutiqaqhutik Purim-mik. Pisigivlugu Mordecai-m tuyuutaa suli iluqaisigun piruatigun ilaiññun, "
233," For Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of all the Jews, had devised plans against the Jews to destroy them. He had cast pur (that is, the lot) in order to afflict and destroy them. ","Jew-guruat pitqurriutigiŋagaat, kiŋuniimigñullu, Jew-guġumaaqtuanullu, piviksraq nalautitaġikpan ukiutuaqpan taapkuak uvluk ilaaguaqtautquvlugik maliġuaġlugi Mordecai-m piraksriutiŋi. "
234," But when the matter came to the king’s attention, the king gave written orders that Haman’s evil intentions that he had devised against the Jews should fall on his own head. He and his sons were hanged on the gallows. ",Nalupqinaimmaġiksiŋagaat Jew-gupayaaqtuanun iḷagiiñun kiŋunġuruanun nunallaamigni suli iniqpallaamigñi itqautausaqługu suli maliġuaġlugi uvluŋi Purim taimuŋaaglaan tikitchaġikpan.
235," For this reason these days are known as Purim, after the name of pur. ","Tavraasii tuvaaqataa umialgum Esther, pania Abihail-gum, piqatigivlugu Mordecai, aglaŋammiuq tuyuqhuni, inillakługu iluqaaqługu ataniġnaqutini tunulliḷiqsuqługu Purim, aglaaġiŋaraŋa Mordecai-m sivuani. "
236," Therefore, because of the account found in this letter and what they had faced in this regard and what had happened to them, the Jews established as binding on themselves, their descendants, and all who joined their company that they should observe these two days without fail, just as written and at the appropriate time on an annual basis. ","Tuyuun aglaaguŋaruq Jew-gupayauraqtuanun, suli tuyuġirauŋaruq iluqaiññun 127-nun nunaaqqiñun Persia-m atanniqsimaviani. Jew-gupayauraqtuat tutqiutiqaquvlugich suli anayanniuquŋił̣ł̣ugich, "
237," These days were to be remembered and to be celebrated in every generation and in every family, every province, and every city. The Jews were not to fail to observe these days of Purim; the remembrance of them was not to cease among their descendants.","Suli piraksriqł̣ugich kiŋuniiŋiḷḷu maliġuaquvlugich uvluŋich Purim piviksraq tikitchaġikpan, akuqtuaġiŋaramisigun maliġuagaksriamisun niġiŋaiḷaġnikun suli qiñunikun. Piraksriutigiŋagaik taapkuak Mordecai-vlu Esther-vlu. "
238," So Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter about Purim. ","Esther-m piraksriutiŋi, nalupqinaiqsaqługi pitquraŋi Purim, aglaaguŋarut immuamun."
239, Letters were sent to all the Jews in the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the empire of Ahasuerus – words of true peace – ,
240," to establish these days of Purim in their proper times, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as they had established both for themselves and their descendants, matters pertaining to fasting and lamentation. ",
241," Esther’s command established these matters of Purim, and the matter was officially recorded.",
242," The Lord said to Jonah son of Amittai, ",Uvlut iḷaŋanni Atanġum uqallautigaa Jonah iġñiŋa Amittai-m. 
243," “Go immediately to Nineveh, that large capital city, and announce judgment against its people because their wickedness has come to my attention.” ","Uqaqhuni, “Aullaġiñ Ninevah-mun, iniqpagmun, kiliktuġlugich; Iḷisimatilaamnik uvva qanutun pigiiḷḷiqirautilaaŋiññik iñuŋich.” "
244," Instead, Jonah immediately headed off to Tarshish to escape from the commission of the Lord. He traveled to Joppa and found a merchant ship heading to Tarshish. So he paid the fare and went aboard it to go with them to Tarshish far away from the Lord. ","Aglaan Jonah, qimaaŋaruq Tarshishmun unitchaqługu Ataniq.

245, But the Lord hurled a powerful wind on the sea. Such a violent tempest arose on the sea that the ship threatened to break up! ,"Aglaan Ataniq aullaqtitchiŋaruq suaŋaruamik anuġimik taġiumun, anuġiqłuk suaŋavaił̣ł̣uni anayanniuliŋarut umiaqpaiyaiġniaġniġmun. "
246," The sailors were so afraid that each cried out to his own god and they flung the ship’s cargo overboard to make the ship lighter. Jonah, meanwhile, had gone down into the hold below deck, had lain down, and was sound asleep. ","Umiaqpagaqtit iqsiññiulipiaġataŋarut suli ququulavlutiŋ ikayuquvlutiŋ nanmiñiq God-igillaaramignun.

247," The ship’s captain approached him and said, “What are you doing asleep? Get up! Cry out to your god! Perhaps your god might take notice of us so that we might not die!” ","Qaukłiŋata Umiaqpaum paqitkaa, aasii apiqsruqługu, “Summan immaimña siñiktuaqpich? Makillutin aŋaiyyuiñ God-ignun ikayuqulutin.

248," The sailors said to one another, “Come on, let’s cast lots to find out whose fault it is that this disaster has overtaken us.” So they cast lots, and Jonah was singled out. ","Umiaqpagaqtit avanmun uqaaqsiñiqsut, “Saaptaġluta, iḷitchuġiyumaugut kiña patchisautilaaŋa anayanniuġniptigni.” Tavraasii tainna piŋarut, aasii Jonah-m atqa amuŋagaat. "
249," They said to him, “Tell us, whose fault is it that this disaster has overtaken us? What’s your occupation? Where do you come from? What’s your country? And who are your people?” ","Tavra uqallautigaat, “Ki, aasii, uqallautisigut! Kiña imña patchisauva? Suliqivich imña maani? Kisumiñ nunamiñ qairuatin? Sumiuyaaguvich?”"
250," He said to them, “I am a Hebrew! And I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the dry land.” ","“Hebrew-guruŋa,” Jonah-m kiugai. “Qiksiksrautiqaqtuŋa ATANIĠ-mun, God-iŋanun qiḷaum, savaŋaruam nunamiglu taġiumiglu.” "
251," Hearing this, the men became even more afraid and said to him, “What have you done?” (The men said this because they knew that he was trying to escape from the Lord, because he had previously told them.) ","Jonah-m uqallautiniġai qimaatilaamiñik ATANIĠ-miñ. Tavraasii umiaqpagaqtit iqsiḷipiaġataŋarut, aasii uqallautivlugu, “Uvva iłuaŋipiaġataqtuq tainna piñiqavich!” suli apiġivlugu, “Summan uvva qimaaruatin tainna?”"
252," Because the storm was growing worse and worse, they said to him, “What should we do to you to make the sea calm down for us?” ","Siḷaqłuk suamasisaiññaŋaruq, aasii umiaqpagaqtit apiġigaat, “Qanuq imña piñiaġniqpisigiñ siḷaqłiuŋaiġumaugut?”"
253," He said to them, “Pick me up and throw me into the sea to make the sea quiet down, because I know it’s my fault you are in this severe storm.” ","Jonah-m kiugai, “Igitchiñŋa taġiumun, anuġaiġumauq. Iḷisimaruŋa patchisautilaamnik uvva siḷaqłukpaguutimmasi.”"
254," Instead, they tried to row back to land, but they were not able to do so because the storm kept growing worse and worse. ","Aglaan, aŋutit tulautiniatanagutiŋagaat umiaqpak, aŋualgutilaamiktun. Aglaan anuġi iŋattaqsisaiññaqhuni, payyiñŋagaat. "
255," So they cried out to the Lord, “Oh, please, Lord, don’t let us die on account of this man! Don’t hold us guilty of shedding innocent blood. After all, you, Lord, have done just as you pleased.” ","Tainnamik ququulanagutiŋarut ATANIĠ-mun, “Ataniiq, tatavsaġnasigut tuqqunmik uuma iñuum iñuggutaa pisigilugu! Ilvich, Ataniiq, aŋalatkiñ tamanna; ilvich savaaġigiñ.” "
256," So they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea, and the sea stopped raging. ","Tavraasii tiguvlugu Jonah siŋitkaat taġiumun, aasii qaiḷḷiiqsautigillaaŋaruq. "
257," The men feared the Lord greatly, and earnestly vowed to offer lavish sacrifices to the Lord.","Umiaqpagaqtit tavrani qiksiksralipiallaŋarut ATANIĠ-mik, aasii qaitchivḷutiŋ aitchuunmik suli unniqsuqłiivḷugu savautiniaġnivḷugu."
258, Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish ,Jonah aasii aŋaiyyunagutiŋaruq ATANIĠ-mun God-imiñun iḷuaniillaġmi iqaluum:
259," and said, ","Tavraasii Atanġum piraksriŋagaa tivvuaquvlugu Jonah paliumaruamun nunamun, aasii tivvuaŋagaa."
260,"“I called out to the Lord from my distress, ",
261,and he answered me; ,
262,"from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help, ",
263,and you heard my prayer.,
264," You threw me into the deep waters, ",
265,into the middle of the sea; ,
266,the ocean current engulfed me;,
267,all the mighty waves you sent swept over me.,
268," I thought I had been banished from your sight,",
269,that I would never again see your holy temple!,
270, Water engulfed me up to my neck;,
271,the deep ocean surrounded me;,
272,seaweed was wrapped around my head.,
273, I went down to the very bottoms of the mountains;,
274,the gates of the netherworld barred me in forever;,
275,"but you brought me up from the Pit, O Lord, my God.",
276," When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the Lord,",
277,and my prayer came to your holy temple.,
278, Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs.,
279," But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise; ",
280,I will surely do what I have promised.,
281,Salvation belongs to the Lord!”,
282, Then the Lord commanded the fish and it disgorged Jonah on dry land.,
283," The Lord said to Jonah a second time, ",Ataniq uqallavsaaŋaruq Jonah-mun. 
284," “Go immediately to Nineveh, that large city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you.” ","Uqaqłuni, “Aullaġiñ Nineveh-mun, iniqpagmun, uqautiyyaġlugich iñuich uqalugmik qaisamnik iliŋnun.” "
285," So Jonah went immediately to Nineveh, as the Lord had said. (Now Nineveh was an enormous city – it required three days to walk through it!) ","Jonah-m kamagiŋagaa Ataniq aasii Nineveh-mukłuni, iniqpauvił̣ł̣uni piŋasuni uvluni pisuaqtuni tapiglagataġnaqtuq. "
286," When Jonah began to enter the city one day’s walk, he announced, “At the end of forty days, Nineveh will be overthrown!”","Jonah aullaqiŋaruq iniqpagmun, pisuaganikami uvluq naałługu, uqautinagutiŋagai, “Malġukipiat uvlut pianikpata Nineveh suksraunġiqsauniaqtuq!”"
287," The people of Nineveh believed in God, and they declared a fast and put on sackcloth, from the greatest to the least of them. ","Tavraasi iñuŋisa Nineveh-m ukpiġiŋagaat Godim kiliktuutigipkaqtaŋa.

288," When the news reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, took off his royal robe, put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes. ","Umialikpaŋa Nineveh-m tusaakami, makiłłuni aquppiutaqpagmiñiñ, mattaqługu qaliġuani, ativluni miitchugnik, aquvinŋaruq aġranun. "

","Kiliktuipkaiŋaruq iñuŋiñun Nineveh-m: “Uvva una piraksriutaa umialgum atanauraŋisalu: Kiñaunnii sumik niġiñiaŋitchuq; iluqaġmiŋ iñuich, niġrutit, suli imnaich niġitquŋisaurut naakkaunnii imiqtuksrauŋitchut. "
290," Every person and animal must put on sackcloth and must cry earnestly to God, and everyone must turn from their evil way of living and from the violence that they do.

292, When God saw their actions – they turned from their evil way of living! – God relented concerning the judgment he had threatened them with and he did not destroy them.,Godim tautugniġai qanuq pitilaaŋiññik; tautukkai aġiuŋatilaaŋiññik pigiiḷḷiqutimignik.

311," Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened this way. While his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be pregnant through the Holy Spirit. ","Aasii uiksrautauruaq Joseph, nalaunŋaruaguvluni, Kanŋunaqsiḷiġuŋił̣ł̣ugu Mary iñuŋnun, sivunniŋaruq avitchukługu nalunaqtuakun. "

313," When he had contemplated this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

318," but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.",
319," After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, in the time of King Herod, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem ","Jesus aniŋaruq Bethlehem-mi Judea-miittuami, Herod umialgumman. Tavra Iḷitchiruat iñuich paaŋŋamiñ tikiññamiŋ Jerusalem-mun, apiqsriŋarut. "

321," When King Herod heard this he was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him. ","Herod-gum umialgum tusaakamiuŋ taamna, isumaaluliŋaruq iluqaġmiglu iñuŋi Jerusalem. "
322," After assembling all the chief priests and experts in the law, he asked them where the Christ was to be born. ","Aasii katitiłługich iluqaisa aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich, iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik, apiqsruqtupiaŋagai sumi Christ aniyumaaġmagaan. "
323," “In Bethlehem of Judea,” they said, “for it is written this way by the prophet:","Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, nunaaqqimi Bethlehem-mi Judea-miittuami, qanuq God-im uqaqtaata aglaaġiŋagaa uqalua God-im inna,"
324," ‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,","Aasii kiliktauvlutiŋ siññaktukun utiquŋił̣ł̣ugich Herod-mun, utiqsaŋarut nunamiŋnun allakun apqutikun."

329," After listening to the king they left, and once again the star they saw when it rose led them until it stopped above the place where the child was. ","Tavrani taŋŋiqsauŋaruq Jeremiah-m God-im uqaqtaata uqautigiŋakkaŋa inna,"
330, When they saw the star they shouted joyfully. ,"Tavra Herod tuqumman, isaġulga Atanġum niptaŋaruq siññaktukun Joseph-mun Egypt-mi uqaqłuni, "
331," As they came into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother, they bowed down and worshiped him. They opened their treasure boxes and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. ",Makittin. Aullautikkik miqłiqtuġlu aakaŋalu nunaŋannun Israel. Taipkua tuqutchiyumaruat miqłiqtumik tuquŋarut. 
332," After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back by another route to their own country.","Tavra ilaa makinŋaruq, aasii aullautivlugik miqłiqtuġlu aakaŋalu nunaŋannun Israel."
333," After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to look for the child to kill him.” ","Tavra tusaakamiuŋ Archelaus umialgutilaaŋanik Judea-mi, inaani aapami Herod tuquŋaruam, tavruŋaqsausiiñŋaruq, aasii kiliktauvluni siññaktukun, aullaŋaruq nunaŋiññun Galilee-m.

334," Then he got up, took the child and his mother during the night, and went to Egypt. ","Aasii iñuurraqsiŋaruq iniqpaŋani Nazareth, taamnaptauq uqautigiŋakkaŋat miqłiqtukun uqaqtiŋisa God-im taŋŋiqsauŋaruq inna, “Ilaa tairauniaqtuq Nazareth-miumik.”"
335, He stayed there until Herod died. In this way what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet was fulfilled: “I called my Son out of Egypt.”,
336," When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he became enraged. He sent men to kill all the children in Bethlehem and throughout the surrounding region from the age of two and under, according to the time he had learned from the wise men. ",
337, Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: ,
338," “A voice was heard in Ramah, ",
339,"weeping and loud wailing, ",
340,"Rachel weeping for her children, ",
341,"and she did not want to be comforted, because they were gone.”",
342," After Herod had died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt ",
343," saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the child’s life are dead.” ",
344, So he got up and took the child and his mother and returned to the land of Israel. ,
345," But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After being warned in a dream, he went to the regions of Galilee. ",
346," He came to a town called Nazareth and lived there. Then what had been spoken by the prophets was fulfilled, that Jesus would be called a Nazarene.",
347," In those days John the Baptist came into the wilderness of Judea proclaiming, ","Taipkunani uvluni John Paptaiqsi qaiŋaruq, alġaqsruivḷuni nunagluktuaŋani Judea-m. "
348," “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” ","Uqaqłuni, isumalitqigitchi, qanuq God-im atanniqsimasaaqsigai iñuich. "
349, For he is the one about whom Isaiah the prophet had spoken: ,"John-guŋaruq Isaiah-m God-im uqaqtaata uqallausiġiŋakkaŋa,"

354, and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.,Iñuusitchi nalunaiġḷugu isumalitqiksilaaqsi piḷuutivsiññiñ. 
355," But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?

358," Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.","Ilaan amiġaiyautini kakiuraqpait saagaġigai, suli suaqłuiyaġniaġaa amiġaiyaiviñi aasii katillugich palauvaksrat tutquiviŋmun, aglaan ikipkaġniaġai amiġaŋich qaminnaġumiñaitchuamik igniġmik."

364," After Jesus was baptized, just as he was coming up out of the water, the heavens opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming on him. ",
365," And a voice from heaven said, “This is my one dear Son; in him I take great delight.”",
366, Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. ,Tavra Jesus aullatiŋagaa Ilitqusiġiksuam nunagluktuamun ikł̣igutchaktinniaquvlugu Tuunġaġmun.

653," For my yoke is easy to bear, and my load is not hard to carry.”",

663," A man was there who had a withered hand. And they asked Jesus, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?” so that they could accuse him. ","Iñuk tavrani inŋaruq argakisuurauniqsuaq.

664," He said to them, “Would not any one of you, if he had one sheep that fell into a pit on the Sabbath, take hold of it and lift it out? ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Nalliqsi ilivsiññi, atautchimik imnaiqaġniġumi katakpan iḷuqsramun Savaisillugich, qiluyumiñaitpauŋ? "
665, How much more valuable is a person than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.” ,Iñuk piqpaŋnałhaaqtuq imnaimiñ. Tavraasii nalaunŋaruq anniqsuiruni Savaiññiġmi. 
666," Then he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out and it was restored, as healthy as the other. ","Tavrani ilaan uqallautiŋagaa iñuk, Isaakkich argaktin. Tavra isaaŋagai, aasii argaŋi iłuaqsirauŋarut igḷumiktun. "
667," But the Pharisees went out and plotted against him, as to how they could assassinate him.",Tavrali Pharisees aniŋarut aasii sivunniugaqsivḷutiŋ qanuġlugu Jesus tuqutchukługu.
668," Now when Jesus learned of this, he went away from there. Great crowds followed him, and he healed them all. ","Jesus, iḷisimavlugu taamna, aullaŋaruq tavraŋŋa. Aasii iñugiaktuat maliŋagaat. Suli ilaan iłuaqsiŋagai iluqaisa naŋittuat. "
669, But he sternly warned them not to make him known. ,Ilaan piraksriŋagai quliaqtuaġitquŋił̣ł̣uni.

674," He will not quarrel or cry out, ","Jesus iḷisimavlugich isumaŋich, uqallautiŋagai, Nunauruat atinġiqł̣utiŋ aŋuyautikamiŋ inmiŋnun suksraunġiġuurut. Suli iniqpakkaluaq naaggaunnii igluqpaum iñuŋi atinġiqamiŋ suksraunġiġñiaqtut inmiŋnik. "

676," He will not break a bruised reed or extinguish a smoldering wick, ","Aasii uvaŋa anittaġupkich ilitqusiqł̣uich Beelzebul-kun, kikulli maliġuaqtivsi anittaġuuvatigik? Tavra iliŋich isivġiqsiginiaġisi iḷisimanaqsiḷugu killukuapiaġataqtilaaqsi. "

679, Then they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was blind and mute. Jesus healed him so that he could speak and see. ,"Iñuk piqatauŋitchuaq uvamnun akiḷḷiuruq uvamnun, iñuktun ittuq kivriñaqsimman palauvaksranik katitchiqataugaluaġnani siavsigiññaqtuatun. "
680," All the crowds were amazed and said, “Could this one be the Son of David?” ","Tavraasii uqallautigivsi, God-im suliqutigiŋaiġumiñaġai itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich iluqaisa iñuich piḷuutiŋich iluqaisalu pigiitchuat uqallautiŋich, aglaan iñuk uqaqtuaq pigiitchuamik Ilitqusiġiksuakun, sumikunnii suliqutigiŋaiqsauyumiñaitchuq.

681," But when the Pharisees heard this they said, “He does not cast out demons except by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons!” ","Suli kiñapayaaq uqallakkumi pigiitchuamik Iġñiŋagun iñuum suliqutigiŋaiqsauyumiñaqtuq itqaumayumiñaiġḷugu, aglaan kiñaliqaa uqallaqtuaq pigiitchuamik Ilitqusiġiksuakun suliqutigiŋaiqsauyumiñaitchuq, paŋmapak isuitchuamullu."
682," Now when Jesus realized what they were thinking, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and no town or house divided against itself will stand. ","Napaaqtuq iḷitchuġinaġmatun nakuutilaaŋanik naagga pigiisilaaŋanik siiġñiaŋigun, tainnaptauq iñuich iḷisimanaġmiut. "
683," So if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? ",Ilivsi tuqunalgich nimiġiat. Qanuġlusi uqaluqaġniaqpisi nakuuruamik piḷullavsi? Iñuum salapqiagaa irrusipiani uqaluŋmigun.

685," But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has already overtaken you. ","Uqallautigivsi, uvluani isivġiġvium iñuich pasirauniaqtut anniqsuutauŋitchuatigun uqalupayauratigun uqallausiġikkamikkun. "
686," How else can someone enter a strong man’s house and steal his property, unless he first ties up the strong man? Then he can thoroughly plunder the house. ","Qanuq uqaluvsigun patchisaiqsauniaqtusi, suli uqaluvsigun pasirauniaqtusi."

698," The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them – and now, something greater than Jonah is here! ","Tavra isaaqługich argagni tuŋaannun iḷitchitqurami, ilaa uqallaŋaruq, marra makua aakagimmatullu aniqatigimmatullu itkitka. "
699," The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon – and now, something greater than Solomon is here!

700," “When an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it passes through waterless places looking for rest but does not find it. ",
701," Then it says, ‘I will return to the home I left.’ When it returns, it finds the house empty, swept clean, and put in order. ",
702," Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so the last state of that person is worse than the first. It will be that way for this evil generation as well!”",
703," While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers came and stood outside, asking to speak to him. ",
704," Someone told him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to speak to you.” ",
705," To the one who had said this, Jesus replied, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?” ",
706," And pointing toward his disciples he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! ",
707, For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.”,
708," On that day after Jesus went out of the house, he sat by the lake. ",Taavrumanisuli uvlumi Jesus aniŋaruq iglumiñ aasii aquptaaŋaruq tatchim siñaanun iḷisaurrisukłuni. 
709, And such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat to sit while the whole crowd stood on the shore. ,"Tavra iñugiapiaġataqtuat iñuich katirvigiŋagaat avałługu, kiisaimma ikivuq umiaqpauramun aasii tavruŋa aquptaaqłuni, aasiiḷi iñusalaich makitavlutiŋ siñaani. "
710," He told them many things in parables, saying: “Listen! A sower went out to sow. ","Tavra ilaan uqautiŋagai iñugiaktuanik uuktuutitigun, uqaqłuni, Nunaliqiri aullaqtuq kanġaqsruiyaqtuqłuni nautchiaksranik palauvaksraġuġniaqtuanik. "
711," And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. ","Tavra kanġaqsruipkaqtillugu iḷaŋich kataŋarut apqutinun, aasii tiŋmiat qaivḷutiŋ niġiŋagaich. "
712, Other seeds fell on rocky ground where they did not have much soil. They sprang up quickly because the soil was not deep. ,"Iḷaŋich aasii kataŋarut uyaġauruamun nunamun nunaqapiaŋitchuamun. Tavrauvvaa naurut, qanuq mapturuamik nunaitchuq. "
713," But when the sun came up, they were scorched, and because they did not have sufficient root, they withered. ","Siqiñiq salapqiġman maŋŋuił̣ł̣utiŋ panaqłuŋagai, aasii tuquvlutiŋ. "
714," Other seeds fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked them. ","Aasii iḷaŋich nautchiaksrat kataŋarut akunġannun kakiḷḷaġnaqtuat nauruat, aasii kakiḷḷaġnaqtuat nauvlutiŋ nagguviksraiŋagaich, naupkaŋił̣ḷugich nautchiaksrat. "

716, The one who has ears had better listen!”,"Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Siutiqaqtusi tusaggatiksraŋnik, naalaġnisiŋa."
717," Then the disciples came to him and said, “Why do you speak to them in parables?” ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat qaivḷutiŋ Jesus apiġiŋagaat, Summan uqaqpich iñuŋnun uuktuutitigun? "
718," He replied, “You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but they have not. ","Ilaan kiuŋagai, God-im kaŋiqsipkaŋagaa ilivsiññun kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruaq sivuani atanniqsimmatini iñuŋnun, aglaalli allat iñuich tusaqsraġigaat uuktuutitigun. "

734," When anyone hears the word about the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches what was sown in his heart; this is the seed sown along the path.

739, He presented them with another parable: “The kingdom of heaven is like a person who sowed good seed in his field. ,"Ilaa tainna piŋaruq taŋŋiutausaqługu God-im uqaqtaata uqaluanun inna,"
740," But while everyone was sleeping, an enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. ","Tavrani Jesus qimaŋagai iñusalaich aasii isiqłuni iglumun. Aasii iḷitchitquraŋi ullautiŋarut ilaanun uqaqłutiŋ, uqauttutigut sivuniŋanik uuktuutim palauvaksraġiitchuatigun nautchiaqaġviŋmi. "

750, This fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet: ,"Paqinnami atautchimik akisuruamik uyaġagiksuamik akisuqpaktuamik, aullaqłuni tuniŋagai suġauttapayaani, aasii tauqsiqł̣ugu taamna akisuruaq uyaġagiksuaq."
751,"“I will open my mouth in parables, ","Aasiisuli Atanniqsimmataa Taavruma qiḷaŋmiittuam ittuq kuvratun kuvriutauruatun, aasii kuvraqługich qanusipayaat iqaluich. "
752,I will announce what has been hidden from the foundation of the world.”,"Kuvraġviksraiġutimman, iñuich nuqinŋagaat nunamun aasii aquptaaqłutiŋ ilaaguaqługich nakuuruat iqaluich utkusigñun, aasii igiłługich pigiitchuat. "
753," Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him saying, “Explain to us the parable of the weeds in the field.” ","Tainnatun inniaqtuq nunam isuani. Isaġulgich qaiñiaqtut aasii ilaaguaġlugich pigiitchuat iñuich nakuuruaniñ, "
754," He answered, “The one who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man. ",aasii igillugich inaanun igniqpaum. Tavrani iñuich qianiaqtut suli tiriqtinniaġaich kigutitiŋ.
755," The field is the world and the good seed are the people of the kingdom. The weeds are the people of the evil one, ","Jesus apiġiŋagai, Kaŋiqsivisigik taapkua iluqaisa? Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Aaŋ. "
756," and the enemy who sows them is the devil. The harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels. ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Tavraasii kaŋiqsiñiġuvsi, itqaumasitchi tamatkua iḷisaŋaruat Atanniqsimmataanik Taavruma qiḷaŋmiittuam igluqpiraqtuatun ittut, salapqiiḷḷaruatun sunik nutauruanik naagga utuqqauruanik suġalliqpiŋmiŋniñ."
757," As the weeds are collected and burned with fire, so it will be at the end of the age. ","Tavra Jesus naannamigich taapkua uuktuutit, ilaa aullaŋaruq tavraŋŋa. "
758," The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes sin as well as all lawbreakers. ","Aasii tikiññami ilaan nunamiñun, iḷisautiŋagai iñuich aŋaiyyuvianni. Iñuich aliuġutchaŋarut, aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Sumiñ uvvauna iñuk piññakpa inna isumattunmik makkuniŋalu aliuġnaqtuanik savaanik? "
759," They will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ","Uvvauna kaamniġum iġñiġiŋitpauŋ? Aakaŋa taiguutiqaŋitpa Mary-mik? Aasiisuli aniqatigiŋitpagich James-lu, Joseph-lu, Simon-lu, Judas-lu? "
760, Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one who has ears had better listen!,Suli nayaaluŋi maani iñuuŋitpat? Sumiñ aasiuvvauna iñuk piññakpa isumattunmik piḷḷasivḷuniḷu aliuġnaqtuanik? 
761," “The kingdom of heaven is like a treasure, hidden in a field, that a person found and hid. Then because of joy he went and sold all that he had and bought that field.","Tavra iliŋich qanuqpaaŋaliŋarut. Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, God-im uqaqtaa nanġausiaqallaruq sumiḷiqaa aglaan nunamiñi iḷamiñiḷu. "
762," “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls. ","Tavra ilaa piŋaitchuq iñugiaktuanik aliuġnaqtuanik savaanik tavrani, pisigivlugu ukpiġutairrutaat."
763," When he found a pearl of great value, he went out and sold everything he had and bought it.",
764," “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was cast into the sea that caught all kinds of fish. ",
765," When it was full, they pulled it ashore, sat down, and put the good fish into containers and threw the bad away. ",
766, It will be this way at the end of the age. Angels will come and separate the evil from the righteous ,
767," and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.",
768," “Have you understood all these things?” They replied, “Yes.” ",
769," Then he said to them, “Therefore every expert in the law who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the owner of a house who brings out of his treasure what is new and old.”",
770," Now when Jesus finished these parables, he moved on from there. ",
771," Then he came to his hometown and began to teach the people in their synagogue. They were astonished and said, “Where did this man get such wisdom and miraculous powers? ",
772," Isn’t this the carpenter’s son? Isn’t his mother named Mary? And aren’t his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? ",
773, And aren’t all his sisters here with us? Where did he get all this?” ,
774," And so they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own house.” ",
775, And he did not do many miracles there because of their unbelief.,
776," At that time Herod the tetrarch heard reports about Jesus, ","Tavrani Herod atanaurauruaq Galilee-mi, tusaakami kamanautaanik Jesus, "
777," and he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead! And because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.” ","ilaa uqallaŋaruq kivgamiñun, Ammaamna John Paptaiqsi piuq, aŋiŋaruq tuqqunmiñ. Taamnauvva pisigivlugu savallaruq tamatkuniŋa aliuġnaqtuanik. "
778," For Herod had arrested John, bound him, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, ","Qanuq Herod-gum tigupkaŋagaa John aasii qiḷiqsruipkaqługu isiqługu tigutaaġviŋmun, pisigivlugu Herodias, aniqanmi Philip nuliaŋa. "
779," because John had repeatedly told him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.” ","John Paptaiqsim Herod uqallautigaluamiiŋagaa, nalaunŋaitchuq ilivich tuvaaqasiutigupku aniqarvich nuliaŋa. "
780," Although Herod wanted to kill John, he feared the crowd because they accepted John as a prophet. ","Tavra ilaan tuqutchukkaluaġmivḷugulu sivuuġagiŋagai iñuich, qanuq ilaisa uqaqtigiruaġiŋagaat God-mun."
781," But on Herod’s birthday, the daughter of Herodias danced before them and pleased Herod, ","Tavra Herod annivia tikiñman, pania Herodias kanaakkiuŋaruq sivuġaanni tuyuġmiami, aasii iviġaŋagaa Herod. "
782, so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. ,Tavraasii ilaa unniqsuqłiiŋaruq nalupqinaiqł̣ugu aitchuġniaġnivḷugu supayaamik apiqsrisukpan. 
783," Instructed by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter.” ","Pisuksaaqtiqaqłuni aakamiñik, niviaqsiaq uqallaŋaruq, Aitchuŋŋa niaquanik John Paptaiqsim uumuŋa puggutauramun ikilugu. "
784," Although it grieved the king, because of his oath and the dinner guests he commanded it to be given. ","Tavra umialik isumaaliŋaruq. Aglaan pisigivlugich nalupqinaiqł̣ugu unniqsuqłiisini sivuġaanni tuyuġmiami, ilaa piraksriiŋaruq aitchuutigitquvlugu apiqsriaŋa. "
785, So he sent and had John beheaded in the prison. ,Herod tilisiŋaruq aasii niaquiqsiłługu John tigutaaġviŋmi. 
786," His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. ","Tavra ilaan niaqua qaġġisiŋagaat puggutauramun aasii aitchuutigivlugu niviaqsiamun, aasiiḷi ilaan qaġġisivlugu aakamiñun. "
787, Then John’s disciples came and took the body and buried it and went and told Jesus.,Tavra John iḷitchitquraŋisa qaivḷutiŋ piŋagaat timaa aasii iḷuviqługu. Aasii aullaqłutiŋ quliaqtuaġutiŋagaat Jesus.
788," Now when Jesus heard this he went away from there privately in a boat to an isolated place. But when the crowd heard about it, they followed him on foot from the towns. ","Tavra Jesus tusaakamiuŋ taamna, ilaa aullaŋaruq tamaaŋŋa umiaqpaurakun iñuił̣aamun kisimġiuġukłuni. Tavra iñusalaich tusaakamirruŋ, maliŋagaat pisukataqłutiŋ nunaaqqiñiñ. "
789," As he got out he saw the large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. ","Tavra tulagniallaġmiŋ ilaan tautuŋagai iñusalaich, aasii nagliksratchaŋaruq ilaiññik, aasii iłuaqsiŋagai naŋittuaŋich."
790," When evening arrived, his disciples came to him saying, “This is an isolated place and the hour is already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.” ","Unnuksraaġman, iḷitchitqurat ullakługu uqallautiŋagaat, Iñuił̣aaq marra manna ini, unnuagaqsimmivḷuni, aullaqtitkich iñusalaich nunaaqqiñun tauqsiġumaut niqiksramiŋnik. "
791," But he replied, “They don’t need to go. You give them something to eat.” ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Aullaŋitkumikunnii suŋitchut, ilivsi aitchuqsigik sunik niqiksraŋiññik. "
792," They said to him, “We have here only five loaves and two fish.” ","Ilaisa uqallautiŋagaat, Tallimanik punniġutiqaqsiññaqtugut malġugniglu iqalluŋnik. "
793," “Bring them here to me,” he replied. ","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Qaġġisisigik uvamnun. "
794," Then he instructed the crowds to sit down on the grass. He took the five loaves and two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to the disciples, who in turn gave them to the crowds. ","Tavra ilaan piraksriŋagai iñusalaich aquvitquvlugich iviŋnun, aasii tiguvlugich tallimat punniġich malġuglu iqalluk aaġluŋaruq qiḷaŋmun, aasii quyyavigivlugu God.

795," They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, twelve baskets full. ",Tavra iluqaġmiŋ niġiŋarut pisuġuiqsuaqłutiŋ. Aasii iḷitchitqurat katitchiŋarut qulit malġugnik aguummagnik siḷiviłługich avguanik iḷakunik. 
796," Not counting women and children, there were about five thousand men who ate.","Aasii taapkua niġiruat 5,000 aŋutit itpalliŋarut, kisitqatigigaluaġnagich aġnat miqłiqtullu."
797," Immediately Jesus made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he dispersed the crowds. ","Tavra iḷitchitqurani ikipkaŋagai umiaqpauramun aasii ayusaqtiłługich sivumiñi ikaanmun, Jesus aullaqtitchiñiaqłuni iñusalagnik. "
798," And after he sent the crowds away, he went up the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone. ","Tavra aullaqtitanikamigich iñusalaich, ilaa mayuŋaruq qimialuŋnun kisimi aŋaiyyuyaqtuqłuni. Tanuġaksimman, Jesus tavraniinŋaruq kisimi. "
799," Meanwhile the boat, already far from land, was taking a beating from the waves because the wind was against it. ","Tavrali umiaqpauraq ayuuŋaruq nunamiñ qaggiuqłutiŋ, anuġim arguġiannaġuutivlugich. "
800," As the night was ending, Jesus came to them walking on the sea. ","Tavra uvluyasimman, Jesus ullaŋagai iḷitchitqurani pisuaqłuni immam qaaŋagun. "
801," When the disciples saw him walking on the water they were terrified and said, “It’s a ghost!” and cried out with fear. ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat tautukamirruŋ pisuaqtuaq immam qaaŋagun, iqsitchaŋarut uqaqłutiŋ, Ilitqusiq marra. Tavra nipaalaŋarut iqsialavlutiŋ. "
802, But immediately Jesus spoke to them: “Have courage! It is I. Do not be afraid.” ,"Tavra tavrauvvaa ilaan uqallautiŋagai, quviatchaktitausitchi. Uvaŋauruŋa. Iqsiñasi. "
803," Peter said to him, “Lord, if it is you, order me to come to you on the water.” ","Tavra Peter-m kiuŋagaa, Ataniiq, iliviupiaġuvich tuksiŋŋa iliŋnun qaitquluŋa immakun. "
804," So he said, “Come.” Peter got out of the boat, walked on the water, and came toward Jesus. ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Qaiñ. Tavra Peter niuŋaruq umiaqpauramiñ aasii pisuaqłuni immam qaaŋagun ullaŋagaa Jesus. "
805," But when he saw the strong wind he became afraid. And starting to sink, he cried out, “Lord, save me!” ","Aglaan iḷitchuġikami anuġimik naŋialiŋaruq, aasii kivisaaqsiruiññaqami nipaalaŋaruq, Ataniiq annautiŋŋa. "
806," Immediately Jesus reached out his hand and caught him, saying to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?” ","Jesus tavrauvvaa isaaŋagai argagni aasii tiguvlugu, uqallautivlugu, Ilivich ukpiġutikitchuatiin. Summan nalupqisukpich? "
807," When they went up into the boat, the wind ceased. ",Tavra ikimmagnik umiaqpauramun anuġaiŋaruq. 
808," Then those who were in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”","Aasii taapkua umiaqpauramiittuat sitquġvigiŋagaat kamanniuġvigivlugu uqaqłutiŋ, Iḷumun Iġñiġigaatin God-im."
809," After they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. ","Tavra ikaaqamiŋ, nunaliñŋarut Gennesaret-mun. "
810," When the people there recognized him, they sent word into all the surrounding area, and they brought all their sick to him. ","Tavra iñuŋi taavruma nunam iḷisaqsrikamiŋ ilaanik, tilisiŋarut uqaluŋmik nunaaqqipayauranun aasii qaġġisivlugich naŋirrutiqapayauraqtuat Jesus-mun, "
811," They begged him if they could only touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.",apiġipiaqługu aksiḷḷagniaqsiññaġukługuunnii siñiġutaa annuġaaŋan. Aasii iñugiaktilaamiktun aksiutiruat iłuaqsirauŋarut.
812," Then Pharisees and experts in the law came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said, ","Tavra Pharisees-lu iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik ullautiŋarut Jesus-mun Jerusalem-miñ aasii apiġivlugu, "
813, “Why do your disciples disobey the tradition of the elders? For they don’t wash their hands when they eat.” ,Summan iḷitchitquravich kamagilaitpatigik iḷisaurrutiŋich maŋŋuupta? Qanuq niġiŋaiñŋaġmiŋ iqaġilaitkaich argatiŋ tuvraġlugu piraksriutaat maŋŋuupta.

815," For God said, ‘Honor your father and mother’ and ‘Whoever insults his father or mother must be put to death.’ ","Qanuq God piraksriiŋaruq Moses-kun, suuŋiḷaġinagik aapallu aakallu. Kiñaliqaa uqallautiqaqtuaq pigiitchuamik aapamigun aakamigullu, tuquruksraupiaqtuq. "

818," Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied correctly about you when he said, ","Ilivsi ukpiŋŋuaqtuasii. Qanutun nalautigiŋaruq Isaiah uqaqtaa God-im uqallausiġikamisi. Ilaan aglaŋagai God-im uqaluŋi inna,"

820,"but their heart is far from me, ","Tavra Jesus ququaŋagai iñuich inmiñun aasii uqallautivlugich, Naalaġnisiŋa kaŋiqsiḷusiḷu. "
821," and they worship me in vain, ","Taavruma qaniġmuktuam niġiruatun piḷuksipkalaitkaa iñuk, aglaan taavruma aniruam qaniġmiñ, uqaluum piḷuksipkaġumiñaġaa iñuk."

823," Then he called the crowd to him and said, “Listen and understand. ","Ilaan kiuŋagai, Nautchiapayaaq qiḷaŋmiittuam Aapama nautchirriutiŋaisaŋa nusuktauniaqtuq. "
824, What defiles a person is not what goes into the mouth; it is what comes out of the mouth that defiles a person.” ,"Ilimiktun piḷich. Aullarrirut ayauŋaruatun iñuktun. Aasii ayauŋaruam iñuum aullatikpauŋ ayauŋaruaq iñuk, iluqatik qargisaġniaqtuk. "

826," And he replied, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted. ","Ilaalli uqallautiŋagai, Ilivsivsauq kaŋiqsisaiñmivisi? "
827," Leave them! They are blind guides. If someone who is blind leads another who is blind, both will fall into a pit.” ","Kaŋiqsiŋaitpisiuŋ sunapayaaq qaniġmuktuaq aqiaqqumuguuruq, aasii anivḷuni timimiñ. "

829," Jesus said, “Even after all this, are you still so foolish? ","Qanuq iñuum isumaqaġvianiñ salapqiġuurut pigiitchuat isumat piḷġusiġiitchuallu, iñuaġutit, allatuutit, tigligautit, saglutiginnigniġich, tiġlirautit. "
830, Don’t you understand that whatever goes into the mouth enters the stomach and then passes out into the sewer? ,"Tamatkua tamarra piḷuksipkaġaat iñuk, aglaan niġiruni iqaġigaluaġnagich argaich piḷuksisauŋitchuq iñuŋmun."
831," But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and these things defile a person. ",Tavra Jesus aullaŋaruq tavraŋŋa aasii aullaqłuni nunaaqqiŋiñun Tyre-m Sidon-lu. 
832," For out of the heart come evil ideas, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false testimony, slander. ","Tavra aġnaq Canaan-miu iñuuruaq tamaani ullautiŋaruq nipimigun, Naglikkutiqaġiñ uvamnun Ataniiq, Iġñiŋa David. Paniga atqunaqługu ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuq. "

835," A Canaanite woman from that area came and cried out, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is horribly demon-possessed!” ","Tavra aġnaq qaivḷuni sitquŋaruq sivuġaanun uqaqłuni, Ataniiq, ikayuŋŋa. "

844," As a result, the crowd was amazed when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they praised the God of Israel.","Tavra Jesus apiġiŋagai, Qavsiñik punniġutiqaqpisi? Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Tallimat malġugnik, iñukisuuraniglu iqaluuranik. "
845," Then Jesus called the disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have already been here with me three days and they have nothing to eat. I don’t want to send them away hungry since they may faint on the way.” ",Tavra Jesus piraksriiŋaruq iñusalaich aquvitquvlugich nunamun.

849," he took the seven loaves and the fish, and after giving thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples, who then gave them to the crowds. ","Aasii aullaqtitanikługich iñusalaich, ilaa ikuŋaruq umiaqpauramun aasii aullaqłutiŋ nunaaqqiŋiññun Magadan."
850," They all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. ",
851," Not counting children and women, there were four thousand men who ate. ",
852," After sending away the crowd, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan.",
853," Now when the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. ","Tavra Pharisees-lu Sadducees-lu qaiŋarut Jesus-mun, aasii uuktuaqsaqługu apiġiŋagaat tautuktitquvlutiŋ aliuġnaqtuamik qiḷaŋmiñ, iḷisimanaqsisaġlugu God-mun iviġaumagitilaaŋa. "

857," When the disciples went to the other side, they forgot to take bread. ","Tavra ikaaganikamiŋ taaguŋatchianun tatchim, iḷitchitqurat iḷitchuġiŋarut piiguqtilaamiŋnik punniġnik. "
858," “Watch out,” Jesus said to them, “beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.” ","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Qaunagisitchi nipuŋaiḷḷusiḷu imaksriuqtaŋiññik Pharisees, Sadducees-lu. "

865," When Jesus came to the area of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that the Son of Man is?” ","Tavra Jesus tikiññamiŋ nunaaqqiŋiññun Caesarea Philippi-m, apiġiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Iñuich kiunisuuvanŋa, Iġñiŋa Iñuum? "

868," Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” ","Simon Peter uqallaŋaruq, Ilivich Christ-gurutin, Iġñiŋa iñuuruam God-im. "
869," And Jesus answered him, “You are blessed, Simon son of Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in heaven! ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Quviatchaktitaugiñ Simon iġñiŋa John, qanuq iñuum satqummiŋaitkaa iliŋnun taamna uqallautin, aglaan Aapama qiḷaŋmiittuam. "

872, Then he instructed his disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.,Tavrani Jesus uqautipiaġataŋagai iḷitchitqurani quliaqtuaquŋił̣ł̣ugich kimununnii Christ-guniḷuni.
873," From that time on Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. ","Tavraŋŋaaglaan Jesus iḷisautirraqsiŋagai iḷitchitqurani aullaqtuksraupiaġnivḷuni Jerusalem-mun aasii nagliksaaġutiqaġluni iñugiaktuanik umialiŋnaŋiññiḷḷu Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuliqsiqpagniḷḷu iḷisaurriñiḷḷu pitquranik, aasii tuqutauluni, aasiisuli uvluk piŋayuanni aŋipkaqtauluni.

You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.” ","Tavra Jesus qiviaqługu Peter uqallautiŋagaa, Satan, piiġiñ uvamniñ.

","Tavrani Jesus uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Kialiqaa maligukkumiŋa piruksrauŋitchuq ilaan pisukkamiñik, iqsriutilugu aŋarraurani, itqanaitchuksrauruq tuqqutigiyumiñaġluŋaunnii. "

878, For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life? ,"Iñuk suġallakkaluaġumi supayauranik nunamiittuanik aasii tammautigilugich, ilaa suuramikunnii anniqsuġumiñaitchuq inmiñik.

883," Then Moses and Elijah also appeared before them, talking with him. ","Tavraasii niptaŋaruk ilaiññun Moses-lu Elijah-lu, uqaaqatigivlugu Jesus. "
884," So Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here.

885," While he was still speaking, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, “This is my one dear Son, in whom I take great delight. Listen to him!” ","Uqaġataviksillugu suli, qaummaġiksuam nuvuyam qulaŋiġmagich, nipi nuvuyamiñ uqallaŋaruq, Uvva piviuttaġivlugu Iġñiġa iviġaummatigilluatakkaġa. Naalaġnisiuŋ. "

887," But Jesus came and touched them. “Get up,” he said. “Do not be afraid.” ","Tavra Jesus qaivḷuni aksiŋagai uqallautigillaan, Makittitchi suli iqsiŋaiġitchi. "
888," When they looked up, all they saw was Jesus alone.","Tavrani aaġluqamiŋ, tautuŋitchut iñuŋmik aglaan Jesus kisian."
889," As they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, “Do not tell anyone about the vision until the Son of Man is raised from the dead.” ","Tavra atqallaġmiŋ iġġimiñ, Jesus piraksriŋagai, Quliaqtuaġnasi iñuŋmun tautukkavsiññik, Iġñiŋa Iñuum aŋitchiaġilugu tuqqunmiñ. "

892," And I tell you that Elijah has already come. Yet they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they wanted.

893, Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them about John the Baptist.,Tavrani iḷitchitqurat kaŋiqsiŋarut ilaanun uqautitilaamiŋnik sivuniġivlugu John Paptaiqsi.

895," and said, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he has seizures and suffers terribly, for he often falls into the fire and into the water. ","Ataniiq, Naglikkutiqaġiñ iġñimnun, qanuq ilaa qiiqsruġuuruq aasii nagliksaaqpaguuruq, qanuq akulaitchuami puukaġuuruq igniġmun imiġmullu. "

1021," The blind and lame came to him in the temple courts, and he healed them. ","Tavra uvlaami, utiqsaġniallaġmiŋ iniqpaŋmun, Jesus kaaliŋaruq. "
1022," But when the chief priests and the experts in the law saw the wonderful things he did and heard the children crying out in the temple courts, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became indignant ","Aasii tautukługu fig napaaqtua apqutit saniġaanni ullaŋagaa, aasii paqinŋaitchuq siiġñanik tamarra akutuqpaich kisimiŋ.

1025," Now early in the morning, as he returned to the city, he was hungry. ","Suli supayaamik apiqsriguvsi aŋaiyyutigilugu, aitchuusiaġiniaġiksi ukpiġutiqaġuvsi."
1026," After noticing a fig tree by the road he went to it, but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, “Never again will there be fruit from you!” And the fig tree withered at once. ","Tavra Jesus isiġman aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich umialignaŋisalu Jew-guruat ullaŋagaat iḷisaurripkaqtillugu, aasii uqallautivlugu, Sum ataniġnaqutaagun savaaġivigich tamatkua?

1040," “Listen to another parable: There was a landowner who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey. ","Aquatigun ilaa tilisiŋaruq iġñiġmiñik ilaiññun uqaqłuni, Taluġiniaġaat iġñiġa. "

1050,‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. ,

1053," The one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls will be crushed.” ",
1054," When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they realized that he was speaking about them. ",
1055," They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, because the crowds regarded him as a prophet.",
1056," Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying: ","Tavra Jesus uqarraqsitqiŋaruq uuktuutitigun iñuŋnun uqaqłuni, "

1070, Then the Pharisees went out and planned together to entrap him with his own words. ,Tavrani Pharisees aullaqłutiŋ sivunniuŋarut uuktuġukługu Jesus apiqqutinik. 
1071," They sent to him their disciples along with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and teach the way of God in accordance with the truth.

1077," Now when they heard this they were stunned, and they left him and went away.","Tusaakamirruŋ taamna, aliuŋarut, aasii qimakługu aullaŋarut."
1078," The same day Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to him and asked him, ","Taavrumani suli uvlumi Sadducees qaiŋarut Jesus-mun, uqaġuuruat aŋŋisaiññivḷugu, aasii apiġivlugu apiqqunmik. "

1082," Last of all, the woman died. ",Taapkua iluqaġmiŋ kiŋuatigun aġnaq tuquŋaruq.

1280," Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. He said to Peter, “So, couldn’t you stay awake with me for one hour? ","Tavra Jesus aullavsaaŋaruq igḷuvlugu aasii aŋaiyyuvluni, Aapaaŋ, pisuutigigupku nagliksaaqpaktuksrauluŋa, pisuutin piḷi. "

1282," He went away a second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cup cannot be taken away unless I drink it, your will must be done.” ","Tavra Jesus qimatqiŋagai, aullaqłuni aŋaiyyuvsaaŋaruq piŋatchiqł̣ugik, uqalugivlugich taapkuasuli uqaluich. "

1285," Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is approaching, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

1287," While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. ","Tavra Judas qaiŋaruq Jesus-mun tavrauvvaa aasii uqallakłuni, Tutqigiñ Iḷisaurrii, aasii kunikł̣ugu. "
1288," (Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him!”) ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Avilaitqaan, piñasuaġuŋ piyaqtukkan. Tavra iliŋich qaivḷutiŋ tigguġluŋagaat Jesus. "

Day after day I sat teaching in the temple courts, yet you did not arrest me. ","Tavrani taapkua tiguriruat Jesus-mik aullautiŋagaat Caiaphas-mun, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannun, iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik, umialiŋnallu katirviannun. "
1296, But this has happened so that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples left him and fled.,"Tavra Peter-m maliŋagaa uŋasiuraaqługu, siḷalliġuaŋanunaglaan inaanun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata aasii isiqłuni ilaan aquptaaqatigiŋagai munaqsrich qiñiġukłuni isuanunaglaan.

1297," Now the ones who had arrested Jesus led him to Caiaphas, the high priest, in whose house the experts in the law and the elders had gathered. ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu iluqaġmiglu uqaqsitaaqtitchirit ivaqłiaŋarut patchisiksranik saglutigilugu uqautigisukługu Jesus, tuqutchukługu. "
1298," But Peter was following him from a distance, all the way to the high priest’s courtyard. After going in, he sat with the guards to see the outcome. ","Tavra paqillaiġutiŋarut pasikkutiksranik, qanutun iñugiaktigigaluaqtut saglutikun uqautiginniktuat ilaanik. Kiisaimmaa malġuk saavitpuk, "
1299, The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were trying to find false testimony against Jesus so that they could put him to death. ,"aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Uvvauna iñuk uqallaŋaruaq, Uvaŋa suksraunġiġumiñaġiga God-im aŋaiyyuvikpaŋa, aasii nappatqigḷugu uvluni piŋasuni."

1306," What is your verdict?” They answered, “He is guilty and deserves death.” ","uqaqłutiŋ, Nalautchaġiñ, Christ-guruatiin, kia qakiqpatin?"
1307," Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists. And some slapped him, ","Tavrali Peter aquppiŋaruq siḷalliġmi. Aasii aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata niviaqsiaq kivgaŋa ullakługu Peter uqallautiŋagaa, Itqatigiŋammigiñ Jesus Galilee-ġmiu. "

1309," Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard.

1311," When he went out to the gateway, another slave girl saw him and said to the people there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.” ","Akkulivsaallagman tamaani makitaruat ullakługu uqallautilgitkaat Peter, Nalupqinaitchuamik iḷagigaatin taapkua, qanuq uvva uqausipkun iḷisimanaqtutin. "

1313," After a little while, those standing there came up to Peter and said, “You really are one of them too – even your accent gives you away!” ","Tavra Peter itqaiŋaruq Jesus uqallautiŋiñik inmiñun inna, Tiŋmiaq nipanŋaunnagu, piiḷaaġiniaġiŋma piŋasuni. Tavra anivḷuni qiaqpaŋaruq."
1314," At that he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know the man!” At that moment a rooster crowed. ",
1315," Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said: “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” And he went outside and wept bitterly.",
1316," When it was early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people plotted against Jesus to execute him. ",Uvlaatchaurami iluqaġmiŋ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich umialiŋnaŋiḷḷu Jew-guruat sivunniuqatigiiŋarut Jesus-kun tuqutchukługu. 
1317," They tied him up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate the governor.","Tavra qiḷiqsruiŋagaat, aasii aullautivlugu aitchuutigiŋagaat Pilate-mun kavanauruamun."
1318," Now when Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus had been condemned, he regretted what he had done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders, ","Tavrali Judas, Jesus aitchuutigiriŋa, iḷitchuġikami Jesus tuqutaksraġuqtilaaŋanik nunuuraliŋaruq, aasii utiqtiłługich iñuiññaq qulit maniich aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun, umialiŋnanullu, "
1319," saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You take care of it yourself!” ","uqallakłuni, Piḷuksiŋaruŋa aitchuutigivlugu tuqutautquvlugu patchisaitchuaq iñuk. Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Suliqutauva taamna uvaptiŋnun? Qaunakkuiḷḷi iliŋnik. "
1320, So Judas threw the silver coins into the temple and left. Then he went out and hanged himself. ,"Tavra Judas miḷuqsautivlugich maniich ilaaguaqtauŋaruamun aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, ilaa aullaqłuni qimiñŋaruq inmiñik."
1321," The chief priests took the silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, since it is blood money.” ","Tavrali aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich tiguvlugich maniich uqallaŋarut, Pitquratiguaŋaitchuq iksraukpata maniich aitchuutiqaġviŋmun aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, qanuq akigigai iñuktauruam.

1322," After consulting together they bought the Potter’s Field with it, as a burial place for foreigners. ","Tavra uqaaġutigiŋagaich, aasii tauqsiutigivlugich Utkutchirim Nunaŋanik, iḷuviġviksramik iglaaguruanun. "
1323, For this reason that field has been called the “Field of Blood” to this day. ,Tavra taamna pisigivlugu taamna nuna atchiŋagaat Nunaŋa Augum paŋmapaŋmunaglaan. 
1324," Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: “They took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one whose price had been set by the people of Israel, ","Tavrani taŋŋiqsauŋaruq uqautigiŋaraŋa uqaqtaata God-im Jeremiah-m, uqaqłuni, “Ilaisa tiguŋagaich iñuiññaq qulit maniich, aasii tauqsiutigivlugich utkutchirim nunaŋanun, piraksriutaatun Atanġum uvamnun.

1325," and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord commanded me.”","Tavra Jesus makitaŋaruq sivuġaani kavanauruam, aasii kavanauruam apiġiŋagaa, Umialigivatin Jew-guruat? Jesus kiuŋagaa, Tainna uqallaktutin. "
1326," Then Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” Jesus said, “You say so.” ","Tavra ilaa saŋutkaluaġmanni aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu umialiŋnallu, kiulaiñŋagai. "
1327," But when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he did not respond. ","Kiisaimmaa Pilate uqallakpuq ilaanun, Tusaqsraġiŋitpigich qanutun iñugiaktigiruat uqautigikkaŋich ilipkun? "
1328," Then Pilate said to him, “Don’t you hear how many charges they are bringing against you?” ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋaitkaa sumikunnii, kavanauruaq aliuġutchapiaġataqługu."
1329," But he did not answer even one accusation, so that the governor was quite amazed.","Tavra niqinaqilimaaġmata Itqaunmik qulaurrusiqiviŋmun, kavanauruaq piḷġusiqaŋaruq anipkaivḷuni nallipayaaŋannik tigutaaqtat, iñuich pisukkaŋannik. "
1330," During the feast the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd, whomever they wanted. ","Tavra tigutaaqtaqaŋarut iñugiiḷapiaġatamik, atiqaqtuamik Barabbas-mik. "
1331, At that time they had in custody a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas. ,"Tavra katinmata Pilate apiġiŋagai, Kimik anipkaitquvisiŋa? Barabbas-mik, naagga Jesus-mik taggisiqaqtuamik Christ-mik? "
1332," So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you, Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called the Christ?” ",Qanuq Pilate iḷisimaŋaruq killuġivlugu Jesus ilaiññun aitchuutigiŋatilaaŋanik inmiñun.

1339," When Pilate saw that he could do nothing, but that instead a riot was starting, he took some water, washed his hands before the crowd and said, “I am innocent of this man’s blood.

1370," Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee and given him support were also there, watching from a distance. ","Iḷagiŋagaat Mary Magdalene, Mary suli aakaŋak James-lu Joseph-lu, aakaŋaglu iġñakisa Zebedee-m."
1371," Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.","Tavra unnuksraaġman, suġalliruaq iñuk qaiŋaruq Arimatheamiñ, atiqaqtuaq Joseph-mik, iḷitchitquraummiñiqsuaq Jesus-mun. "
1372," Now when it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who was also a disciple of Jesus. ",Ilaa ullautiŋaruq Pilate-mun aasii apiqsriaġivlugu timaa Jesus. Tavrani Pilate piraksriiŋaruq aitchuutigitquvlugu Jesus timaa Joseph-mun. 
1373, He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered that it be given to him. ,"Tavra Joseph atqaqługu timi, nimmaaŋagaa nutauruamik ukił̣haaġiqsuamik. "
1374," Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth, ","Aasii iḷiŋagaa ilaan nanmiñiq nutaamun iḷuvviviŋmiñun, iḷuvviviḷiamiñun uyaġagruakun, aasii ilaan aksraliŋagaa uyaġagruaqpak upkurriutivlugu iḷuvviviŋmun, aasii aullaqłuni. "
1375, and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance of the tomb and went away. ,Mary Magdalene allalu Mary aquppiŋaruk tavrani sanmivḷugu iḷuvvivik.
1376," (Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there, opposite the tomb.)","Siqiñiq nipianiŋman, Jew-guruat nutauruaq uvluat isagutimman, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich Pharisees-lu kasimaqatigiŋagaat Pilate, "
1377, The next day (which is after the day of preparation) the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate ,"aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Kamanaaq, itqaumarugut qanuq taimña sagluqinnikti iñuuŋŋaġmi uqaŋatilaaŋanik, Uvlut piŋasut pianikpata aŋiñiaqtuŋa. "

"
1379," So give orders to secure the tomb until the third day. Otherwise his disciples may come and steal his body and say to the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.” ","Pilate uqallautiŋagai, munaqsriqaqtusi aŋuyaktinik anayanaiyaġiaqsiuŋ piyumiñaqtilaavsisun.

1389, In the wilderness John the baptizer began preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. ,"Taipkunani uvluni, Jesus qaiŋaruq iniqpaŋmiñ Nazareth-miñ, Galilee-miittuamiñ, aasii paptaiqsiłłuni John-mun kuuŋmi Jordan-mi. "
1390," People from the whole Judean countryside and all of Jerusalem were going out to him, and he was baptizing them in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins. ","Tavra tavrauvvaa qakikami immamiñ, Jesus tautuŋagaa qiḷak aŋmaqtuaq, suli Ilitqusiġiksuaq tiŋmiatun atqaqtuaq inmiñun. "
1391," John wore a garment made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey. ","Tavra tusaaŋagaa nipi qiḷaŋmiñ, Ilivich piviuttaġivlutin Iġñiġigikpiñ, iviġaummatigilluataġikpiñ."

1394, Now in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River. ,"Tavra John tigutaaqtauganiŋman, Jesus Galilee-muŋaruq alġaqsruivḷuni tusaayugaaġiksuanik God-miñ, "
1395," And just as Jesus was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. ","uqaqłuni, Piviksraq nalautittuq, God-im atanniqsimasaaqsigai iñuich. Isumalitqigitchi. Ukpiġisiuŋ tusaayugaaġiksuaq."

1398," He was in the wilderness forty days, enduring temptations from Satan. He was with wild animals, and angels were ministering to his needs.","Tavra tavrauvvaa qimaŋagaik kuvratik, aasii malikługu. "
1399," Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus went into Galilee and proclaimed the gospel of God. ","Ayuuġuraanilgiññami tavraŋŋa, tautuŋagik aniqatigiik James-lu, John-lu, iġñiŋik Zebedee-m, umiaqpauramiinniqsuat aapariglu, allaiyaqługich kuvratik. "

1401," As he went along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen). ","Tavra Capernaum-muŋarut. Aasii tavrauvva Jew-guruat Savairvianni, Jesus aŋaiyyuliaŋaruq, aasii iḷisaurrivḷuni. "
1402," Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will turn you into fishers of people.” ","Tavra iñuich kamasuŋarut iḷisaurrutiŋigun, qanuq ilaan iḷisaurrutiŋi kamanaŋarut. Iḷisaurriŋaitchuq pitquranik iḷisaurritun."
1403, They left their nets immediately and followed him. ,"Tavra aŋaiyyuviŋmiinŋaruq iñuk ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuaq, aasii nipaalaŋaruq, "
1404," Going on a little farther, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John his brother in their boat mending nets. ","uqaqłuni, Jesus Nazareth-miu, summan iḷaksiavisigut? Uvaniitpich suksraunġiġukłuta? Iḷisimagiga kiutilaan. Ilivich piḷuutaitchuaq God-im pia. "
1405," Immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.","Tavra Jesus suaŋagaa uqaqłuni, Nipaisaaġiñ. Anniiñ ilaaniñ. "
1406," Then they went to Capernaum. When the Sabbath came, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach. ",Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uum uuliksipkasugruŋagaa suli nipaalavluni aniŋaruq ilaaniñ. 
1407," The people there were amazed by his teaching, because he taught them like one who had authority, not like the experts in the law. ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ kamanniuŋarut, kamasukpaił̣ł̣utiŋ apiqsruqtuutiŋarut ilimiŋnun, Sunauna? Nutauruaq iḷisaurrun? Ataniġnaqutiqaqłuni piraksriḷḷagai ilitqusiqł̣uich, aasii ilaisa kamagillavlugu. "
1408," Just then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out, ",Tavra Jesus tusaaŋagaat aliuġnaġniŋa uqaluk siamiłłuni qilamik sumulliqaa nunaaqqiñun Galilee-mi.
1409," “Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God!” ","Tavra anikamiŋ aŋaiyyuviŋmiñ, tavrauvvaa isiŋarut igluagnun Simon-lu Andrew-vlu, tuvaaqatigivlugik James-lu John-lu. "
1410, But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!” ,"Tavra Simon aakaruaŋa nalaŋaruq naŋiłłuni uunaqsivḷuni, aasii tavrauvvaa uqallautiŋagaat Jesus. "
1411," After throwing him into convulsions, the unclean spirit cried out with a loud voice and came out of him. ","Tavra ullakługu tiguŋagaa argaŋigun, aasii makitiłługu. Suli tavrauvvaa uunnautaiŋaruq, aasii niqłiuġutiaqsivḷugich."
1412," They were all amazed so that they asked each other, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.” ","Tavra anaqaksraaġman, siqiñiq nipianiŋman, Jesus-muutiŋagaich iluqaisa naŋirrutilgich, tamatkualu ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuat. "
1413, So the news about him spread quickly throughout all the region around Galilee.,Tavra iñupayaaŋi iniqpaum katinŋarut sivuġaanun iglum. 
1414," Now as soon as they left the synagogue, they entered Simon and Andrew’s house, with James and John. ","Aasii ilaan iluaqsiŋagai iñugiaktuat naŋirrutilgich qanusiḷimaanik, suli aniłługich iñugiaktuat ilitqusiqł̣uich. Suli ilitqusiqł̣uich uqaqtaiḷivḷugich qanuq iḷisimaŋagaat kiutilaaŋanik."
1415," Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, sick with a fever, so they spoke to Jesus at once about her. ","Tavra uvlaami Jesus itiqłuni uvluġiaġituŋŋaan aniŋaruq, aasii aullaqłuni iñuił̣aamun aŋaiyyuŋaruq. "
1416, He came and raised her up by gently taking her hand. Then the fever left her and she began to serve them. ,"Tavra Simon piqatiniḷu aullaŋarut ivaġiaqługu, "
1417," When it was evening, after sunset, they brought to him all who were sick and demon-possessed. ","aasii paqinnamirruŋ uqallautiŋagaat, Iñupayaat ivaqłiarut iliŋnik. "
1418, The whole town gathered by the door. ,"Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Aullaqta tuglivsiŋñun nunaaqqiñun alġaqsruimmiyumauŋa taamani. Tainnaġiaqłuŋa qaiŋaruŋa. "
1419," So he healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. But he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.","Tavra alġaqsruiŋaruq aŋaiyyuviŋiññi iluqaani Galilee-mi, anittaqługiḷḷu ilitqusiqł̣uich iñuŋniñ."
1420," Then Jesus got up early in the morning when it was still very dark, departed, and went out to a deserted place, and there he spent time in prayer. ","Tavra kiḷḷiġruaqtuqtuaq ullautiŋaruq ilaanun aasii sitquqłuni qasiḷivḷugu uqaqłuni, Pisukkuvich mamititchumiñaġiŋma. "
1421, Simon and his companions searched for him. ,"Tavra Jesus nagliksratchakłuni isaaŋaruq, aasii aksiukługu uqallautiŋagaa, Piyummatiqaqtuŋa. Mamittin. "
1422," When they found him, they said, “Everyone is looking for you.” ","Tavrauvvaa kiḷḷiġruaŋi maminŋarut, aasii salummaqłuni. "
1423," He replied, “Let us go elsewhere, into the surrounding villages, so that I can preach there too. For that is what I came out here to do.” ","Tavra aullaqtitchaqamiuŋ, uqaullaapiaġataŋagaa, "
1424, So he went into all of Galilee preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.,"Sumikunnii uqaġnak taavrumiŋa kimulliqaa. Aglaan aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋmugiñ qanuqitilaaġiaġlutin, aasii aitchuiḷutin ikipkautinik Moses piraksriutiŋiñik, ukpiġnaqsisaġlugu paŋmapak salumasisilaan. "
1425," Now a leper came to him and fell to his knees, asking for help. “If you are willing, you can make me clean,” he said. ","Aglaan aullaqami quliaqtuaqsautigillaġmi piŋaruq sumulliqaa.

1426," Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” ",
1427," The leprosy left him at once, and he was clean. ",
1428, Immediately Jesus sent the man away with a very strong warning. ,
1429," He told him, “See that you do not say anything to anyone, but go, show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering that Moses commanded for your cleansing, as a testimony to them.” ",
1430," But as the man went out he began to announce it publicly and spread the story widely, so that Jesus was no longer able to enter any town openly but stayed outside in remote places. Still they kept coming to him from everywhere.",
1431," Now after some days, when he returned to Capernaum, the news spread that he was at home. ",Tavra Jesus utitqiŋaruq Capernaum-mun uvluġaaġruurat pianiŋmata. Aasii tusaaŋaniġaat aiŋatilaaŋanik. 
1432," So many gathered that there was no longer any room, not even by the door, and he preached the word to them. ","Tavra iñugiaktuat katinŋarut atautchimun, sumikunnii iniksraiġutivlutiŋ, paakkaluamiunnii. Tavra alġaqsruiŋaruq ilaiññun. "
1433," Some people came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them. ","Tavra iñuich qaiŋarut ilaanun, qaġġisivlugu naŋittuaq avatiŋi tuquŋavlutiŋ, akigaqługu sisamat iñuich. "
1434," When they were not able to bring him in because of the crowd, they removed the roof above Jesus. Then, after tearing it out, they lowered the stretcher the paralytic was lying on. ","Aasii qaninŋaġumiñaiññiqamirruŋ Jesus tativlutiŋ iñuich, qiḷaiŋagaat iglum qiḷaŋa nalaagun Jesus. Tavra qiḷaiganikamirruŋ niŋinŋagaat nalaruaq ikuvġamiñi aulasuił̣ł̣uni. "
1435," When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven.” ","Jesus puttuqsrikamiuŋ ukpiġutaat, uqallautiŋagaa aulalaitchuaq, Iġñiiŋ, piḷuutitin suliqutigiŋaiqsaurut itqaumayumiñaiqł̣ugich. "
1436," Now some of the experts in the law were sitting there, turning these things over in their minds: ","Iḷaŋich iḷisaurrit pitquranik aquppiruat tavrani isummatiqaŋarut inna, "
1437, “Why does this man speak this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?” ,Qanuqłuniuna uqaġumiñaqpa tainna God-itun? Kiñaliqaa suliqutigiŋaiqsiyumiñaitchuq piḷuutinik itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich aglaan God kisimi. 
1438," Now immediately, when Jesus realized in his spirit that they were contemplating such thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you thinking such things in your hearts? ","Tavra tavrauvvaa Jesus puttuqsrikami tainna isumaniġmata, uqallautiŋagai, Summan isumavisi tamatkuniŋa? "
1439," Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up, take your stretcher, and walk’? ","Nalliak siġḷiġnaitpa uqallaksaqtuni, Piḷuutitin suliqutigiŋaiqsaurut iliŋnun, naaggaunnii uqallaktuni, Makittin, tigulugich ikuvġatin, pisuaġiñ? "
1440," But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” – he said to the paralytic – ","Tavraasii ukpiġnaqsiḷiġniaġiga ilivsiññun Iġñiŋa Iñuum ataniġnaqutiqaqtilaaŋanik nunami suliqutigiŋaiġumiñaqługich piḷuutit. Ilaan aasii uqallautiŋagaa aulalaitchuaq iñuk, "

1442," And immediately the man stood up, took his stretcher, and went out in front of them all. They were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”","Tavra tavrauvvaa ilaa makinŋaruq, tiguvlugich ikuvġani, aniŋaruq takkuanni iluqaġmiŋ.

1443," Jesus went out again by the sea. The whole crowd came to him, and he taught them. ","Tavra Jesus saavitqiŋaruq tatchim siñaanun, aasii iluqaġmiŋ iñusalaich ullautiŋarut ilaanun. Tavrani ilaan iḷisautiŋagai. "
1444," As he went along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” he said to him. And he got up and followed him. ","Pisuallaġmi Jesus tautuŋagaa tax-nik katitchiri, Levi iġñiŋa Alphaeus, aquppiruaq akiḷiiviŋmi tax-iñik. Jesus uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Maliŋŋa. Levi-m makiłłuni maliŋagaa Jesus."
1445," As Jesus was having a meal in Levi’s home, many tax collectors and sinners were eating with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. ","Qakugulimman Jesus niġiyaqtuŋaruq Levi-m igluanun. Tavrani iñugiaŋarut tax-nik katitchirit piḷuusiqirillu maliktuat Jesus-mun, aasii iḷaŋisa niġiñiaqasiqł̣ugu ilaa iḷitchitquraŋiḷu. "
1446," When the experts in the law and the Pharisees saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, they said to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” ","Tavra iḷisaurrit pitquranik Pharisee-guruat tautukługu niġiqatiqaqtuaq tax-nik katitchirinik, piḷuusiqiriniglu, uqallautiŋagaich iḷitchitquraŋi, Qanuqłuni niġiqatiqaqpa imiqatiqaqpalu tax-nik katitchirinik piḷuusiqiriniglu?

1447," When Jesus heard this he said to them, “Those who are healthy don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”","Jesus tusaakamiuŋ taamna, uqallaŋaruq ilaiññun, Surruitchuat taaktituaksraitchut, aglaan naŋittuat.

1448," Now John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. So they came to Jesus and said, “Why do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don’t fast?” ","Iḷaanni qakugumman iḷitchitquraŋi John Paptaiqsim Pharisee-ḷḷu niġiḷaitkayuktut aŋaiyyuuqłutiŋ.

1449," Jesus said to them, “The wedding guests cannot fast while the bridegroom is with them, can they? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they do not fast.

1450," But the days are coming when the bridegroom will be taken from them, and at that time they will fast. ","Aglaan uiksrautim aullaurrauviksraŋa tikitchumaaqtuq, aasii taimanigu niġiḷaitpaallugniaqtut."
1451," No one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; otherwise, the patch pulls away from it, the new from the old, and the tear becomes worse. ","Iñuk iḷaaqtuutiqalaitchuq iḷiġniġmik nutauruamik ugliŋaitchuamik ukił̣haamik annuġaaluŋmun, qanuq nutauruaq iḷiġniq iḷaaġutauruaq ugligluni aligaaġutiniaqtuq utuqqauruamiñ annuġaamiñ, aasii allaq aglił̣haaġluni.

1453," Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples began to pick some heads of wheat as they made their way. ","Savairvianni Jew-guruat, Jesus pisuaŋaruq palauvaksranik nautchiaqaġvikun, aasii iḷitchitquraŋi iglaullaġmiŋ nutchugairraqsiŋarut palauvaksranik. "

1460," They watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they could accuse him. ","Tavra Jesus naipiqtuŋagaat, iluaqsiriñiaqtilaaŋanik Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋanni, pasisukługu. "
1461," So he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Stand up among all these people.” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa iñuk argakisuuraq, Qaiñ uvuŋa. "
1462," Then he said to them, “Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or evil, to save a life or destroy it?” But they were silent. ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai iñuich, Pitquratiguaŋava Savaiññiġmi nakuurualiqiruni naagga pigiitchualiqiruni? Ikayugaksraġivisigik iñuich naagga iḷatchiġḷugich Savaiññiġmi? Tavra nivliŋiḷḷaŋarut. "
1463," After looking around at them in anger, grieved by the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. ","Tavra Jesus qiñiġaallakługich qinnaliŋaruq pisigivlugu sivunmuuniŋat killukuaġniŋallu, aglaattauq iḷunŋutchautigiŋagai. Ilaan uqallautiŋagaa iñuk, Isaakkich argaktin. Tavra isaaŋagai, aasii argaŋi iłuaqsirauŋarut igḷumiktun. "
1464," So the Pharisees went out immediately and began plotting with the Herodians, as to how they could assassinate him.","Tavra Pharisees aniŋarut, aasii tavrauvvaa sivunniuqatigiaqsivḷugich Herod-kuayaat Jesus-kun, qanuġlugu tuqutchukługu."
1465," Then Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him. And from Judea, ","Tavra Jesus aullaŋaruq iḷitchitquraniḷu tatchimun, aasii iñusalaich maliŋagaat Galilee-miñ Judea-miḷḷu, "
1466," Jerusalem, Idumea, beyond the Jordan River, and around Tyre and Sidon a great multitude came to him when they heard about the things he had done. ","Jerusalem-miḷḷu, Idumea-miḷḷu uŋataaniḷḷu kuugum Jordan, avataanniḷḷu Tyre-vlu Sidon-lu. Iñusalaich ullaaŋagaat tusaaŋavlutiŋ sunik kamanaqtuanik savaaŋiñik. "
1467," Because of the crowd, he told his disciples to have a small boat ready for him so the crowd would not press toward him. ","Iñusalaich iñugiaksivaił̣ł̣utiŋ, Jesus uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani umiamik itqanaiqsitquvlugich, iñuŋnun saqigruginasugaluni. "
1468," For he had healed many, so that all who were afflicted with diseases pressed toward him in order to touch him. ","Ilaan iluaqsiŋagai iñugiaktuat iñuich, aasii taamna pisigivlugu iluqaġmiŋ naŋittuat saqiraqłiŋarut tikiutiniatakłutiŋ ilaanun aksiḷḷasiñiatakługu. "
1469," And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, “You are the Son of God.” ","Suli ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuat, tautukamirruŋ, sitquġaqtut sivuġaanun, aasii nipaalavlutiŋ, Ilivich Iġñiġigaatin God-im. "
1470, But he sternly ordered them not to make him known.,Tavra piraksripiaŋagai quliaqtuaġitquŋił̣ł̣ugu iliŋiññun kiutilaani.
1471," Now Jesus went up the mountain and called for those he wanted, and they came to him. ","Tavra Jesus mayuŋaruq iġġimun, aasii ququaqługich ilimiñun iñuich pigisukkani, aasii ullaŋagaat. "
1472," He appointed twelve (whom he named apostles), so that they would be with him and he could send them to preach ","Tavra piksraqtaaġiŋagai qulit malġuk, iliŋiññun piqatigitquvluni, suli ilaan tilisukługich alġaqsruitquvlugich, "
1473, and to have authority to cast out demons. ,"suli suaŋŋatiqaquvlugich iłuaqsiyumiñaġlugich naŋirrutit, suli anitchumiñaġlugich ilitqusiqł̣uich. "
1474, He appointed twelve: To Simon he gave the name Peter; ,"Ukua piksraqtaaġiŋagai Simon atchikługu Peter-mik, "
1475," to James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee, he gave the name Boanerges (that is, “sons of thunder”); ","aasiiḷi James iġñiŋa Zebedee-m, John-lu aniqataa James, atchikł̣ugik Boanerges-mik, sivuniqaqtuamik kalluktun iññuk, "
1476," and Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, ","aasii Andrew-lu, Philip-lu, Bartholomew-lu, Matthew-lu, Thomas-lu, James-lu iġñiŋa Alpheus, Thaddaeus-lu, Simon-lu Zealot-guruaq, "
1477," and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.","Judas-lu Iscariot, aitchuutiginniktuaq ilaanik."
1478," Now Jesus went home, and a crowd gathered so that they were not able to eat. ",Tavraasii tavrani Jesus aiŋaruq. Aasii iñusalaich katitqiŋarut atautchimun niġiñiayunaiqsaallaisa Jesus-lu iḷitchitquraniḷu. 
1479," When his family heard this they went out to restrain him, for they said, “He is out of his mind.” ","Tavra nanmiñiq iḷaŋisa tusaakamirruŋ taamna, aullaqiŋarut aggisiyaqtuqługu Jesus, qanuq iñuich uqautigivlugu kinnaġuġnivḷugu."
1480," The experts in the law who came down from Jerusalem said, “He is possessed by Beelzebul,” and, “By the ruler of demons he casts out demons.” ","Tavrali iḷisaurrit pitquranik qairuat Jerusalem-miñ uqaŋarut, Ilaa aŋalatiqaqtuq Beelzebul-mik, umialgannik ilitqusiqł̣uich, aasii taavrumuuna anittairuq ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik. "
1481, So he called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan? ,"Tavra iḷisaurrit pitquranik ququaŋagai ilimiñun, aasii uqautiaqsivḷugich uuktuutitigun, Qanuġluni Satan anitchumiñaqpa inmiñik? "
1482," If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom will not be able to stand. ","Nunat iñuŋich atinġiġḷutiŋ inmikkuaŋasiḷutiŋ piyuutiaqsikpata, nunauniŋat siammayaaġniaqtut. "
1483," If a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. ","Tainnatuttauq nanmiñiġiich atinġiġḷutiŋ piyuutiaqsikpata, taapkua nanmiñiġiikkaluat siammayaaġniaqtut. "
1484," And if Satan rises against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand and his end has come. ","Tainnatuttauq Satan ilitqusiqł̣uŋi atinġiġumiŋ piyuutilutiŋ avanmun, ilaan suaŋŋataa isukłiññayaqtuq."
1485, But no one is able to enter a strong man’s house and steal his property unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can thoroughly plunder his house. ,"Iñuk suaŋarualuk qiḷiqsruiqqaaġlugu, iglua pakagnaġniaqtuq suġauttaiġḷugulu. Tainnatuttauq Satan payariraksrauqqaaġniaqtuq ilitqusiqł̣uŋi anitauniaqpata."
1486," I tell you the truth, people will be forgiven for all sins, even all the blasphemies they utter. ","Iḷumun uqallautigivsi. God-im suliqutigiŋaiġumiñaġai itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich iluqaisa iñuich piḷuutiŋich, iluqaisalu pigiitchuat uqallautiŋich, "
1487," But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, but is guilty of an eternal sin” ","aglaan iñuk uqaqtuaq pigiitchuanik Ilitqusiġiksuaq sivuniġilugu sumikunnii suliqutigiŋaiqsauyumiñaitchuq, qanuq pisigilugu taamna piḷuun, ilaa pasirauniaqtuq isuitchuamun. "
1488," (because they said, “He has an unclean spirit”).","Jesus taamna uqallausiġiŋagaa qanuq iñuich uqallausiġiŋagaat inna, Ilaa Jesus ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuq."
1489," Then Jesus’ mother and his brothers came. Standing outside, they sent word to him, to summon him. ","Tavra nukaaluŋi aakaŋalu qaiŋarut tavruŋa, aasii qikaqłutiŋ siḷami, tilisiŋarut ilaanun qaitquvlugu. "
1490," A crowd was sitting around him and they said to him, “Look, your mother and your brothers are outside looking for you.” ","Tavra iñusalaich aquppiruat avataani Jesus, uqallautiŋagaat, Qaŋma, aakaviḷḷu nukaaluuviḷḷu pisukkaatin. "
1491," He answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?” ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Kiuva aakaga aniqatiitkalu? "
1492," And looking at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Here are my mother and my brothers! ","Tavra qiviaŋaruq tamatkunuŋa aquppiruanun avanmiñi, aasii uqallakłuni, Marra makua aniqatigimmatun aakagimmatullu itkitka. "
1493, For whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother.”,"Qanuq kiñaliqaa nalautchiruaq pisuutaanik God-im, taamna aniqatigigiga, aakagigigalu."
1494, Again he began to teach by the lake. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat on the lake and sat there while the whole crowd was on the shore by the lake. ,"Tavra Jesus iḷisaurrisatqiŋaruq tatchim siñaani, aasii tavruŋa iñusalaich katinŋarut ikillasiḷaallaan umiaqpauramun aquviłłuni. Aasii iluqaġmiŋ iñusalaich siñaaniinŋarut tatchim. "
1495," He taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching said to them: ","Tavra ilaan iḷisautiŋagai iñugiaktuanik sunik uuktuutitigun. Aasii iḷisaurrunmiñi uqallautivlugich, "
1496, “Listen! A sower went out to sow. ,Naalaġnisiŋa. Nunaliqiri aullaqtuq kanġaksruiyaqtuqłuni nautchiaksranik palauvaksraġuġniaqtuanik. 
1497," And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. ","Tavra kanġaqsruipkaqtillugu iḷaŋich kataŋarut apqutinun, aasii tiŋmiat qaivḷutiŋ niġiŋagaich. "
1498, Other seed fell on rocky ground where it did not have much soil. It sprang up at once because the soil was not deep. ,"Iḷaŋich aasii kataŋarut uyaġauruamun nunamun nunaqapiaŋitchuamun. Tavrauvvaa naurut, qanuq mapturuamik nunaitchuq. "
1499," When the sun came up it was scorched, and because it did not have sufficient root, it withered. ","Siqiñiq salapqiġman maŋŋuił̣ł̣utiŋ, panaqłuŋagai aasii tuquvlutiŋ. "
1500," Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up and choked it, and it did not produce grain. ","Aasii iḷaŋich nautchiaksrat kataŋarut akunġannun kakiḷḷaġnaqtuat nauruat, aasii kakiḷḷaġnaqtuat nauvlutiŋ nagguviksraiŋagaich nautchiaksrat. "
1501," But other seed fell on good soil and produced grain, sprouting and growing; some yielded thirty times as much, some sixty, and some a hundred times.” ","Allat kataŋarut nunagiksuamun, aasii nauvlutiŋ palauvaksrat iñugiaksivḷutiŋ. Iḷaŋich nauŋarut iñuiññaq qulinik palauvaksranik, iḷaŋich aasii piŋasukipiamik, aasii iḷaŋich tallimakipiamik. "
1502," And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear had better listen!”","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Siutiqaqtusi tusaggatiksraŋnik, naalaġnisiŋa."
1503," When he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. ","Tavra Jesus kisiŋŋuġman, tamatkua avataaniittuat piqatigivlugich qulit malġuk iḷitchitqurat apiġiŋagaat uuktuutikun. "
1504," He said to them, “The secret of the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those outside, everything is in parables,","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, God-im kaŋiqsipkaŋagaa ilivsiññun kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruaq atanniqsimmatini iñuŋnun. Aglaalli allat iñuich tusaqsraġigaat uuktuutitigun. "
1505," so that although they look they may look but not see,","Tamatkua iñuich taŋŋiġaich Isaiah-m uqaluŋi Bible-ni,"
1506,"and although they hear they may hear but not understand,","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, kaŋiqsiŋitkuvsiuŋ una uuktuun, qanuġlusi kaŋiqsiñiaqpisigik uuktuutipayaat? "
1507,so they may not repent and be forgiven.”,"Nunaliqiri kanġaqsruimmatun nautchiaksranik palauvaksraġuġniaqtuanik, tainnatun uqalua God-im alġaqsruutauruq iñuŋnun. "
1508," He said to them, “Don’t you understand this parable? Then how will you understand any parable? ","Nautchiaksrat iḷaŋich kataŋmatun apqutinun, tainnatuttauq iñuich iḷaŋich tusaaruat uqaluanik God-im siqquqsimmiraqtut. Tusaaganipqaġmarruŋ uqaluk Satan-gum piiguipkaġai qilamik tusaakkaŋannik. "
1509, The sower sows the word. ,"Allalli iñuich ittut nautchiaksratun kataktuatun uyaġauruamun nunamun. Tusaapqauraqamirruŋ uqaluk, quyyatigivlugu akuqtuġaat. "
1510," These are the ones on the path where the word is sown: Whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and snatches the word that was sown in them. ","Aglaan akuqtuaġiŋiññiġaat uqaluk naamasiḷugu tuniqsimmatiksraqtiŋ, nautchiaksratun maŋŋuqavigruaŋitchuatun iłłutiŋ.

1512," But they have no root in themselves and do not endure. Then, when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away. ","uŋiarrisit mattumuuna iñuuniaġnikun, piviuttaqsriñġuvlu suġaliġnik, allallu qanusipayaat kipiġniuġutit nagguviksraiġaat uqaluk, aasii iliŋisa iñuusiŋich allaŋŋuqtauŋił̣ł̣utiŋ. "
1513," Others are the ones sown among thorns: They are those who hear the word, ","Aasiiḷi allat iñuich ittut nautchiaksratun kataktuatun nunagiksuamun.

1514," but worldly cares, the seductiveness of wealth, and the desire for other things come in and choke the word, and it produces nothing. ","Qulliq inimuutisuuvarruŋ matusukługu utkusiŋmik, naagga atautitchukługu siñigviŋñun? Naumi. Iḷisuugaat qulliqaġviŋmun. "
1515," But these are the ones sown on good soil: They hear the word and receive it and bear fruit, one thirty times as much, one sixty, and one a hundred.”","Sunapayaaq matutuqtuaq paŋmapak sivunniqsauŋaruq salapqiġumaaqługu taimanigu, suli sunapayaaq iḷisimapkaqtauŋitchuaq paŋmapak sivunniqsauŋaruq iḷitchuġipkaqtauyumaaqługu iñupayaanun taimanigu. "
1516," He also said to them, “A lamp isn’t brought to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? Isn’t it to be placed on a lampstand? ","Taamna pisigilugu, siutiqaqtusi tusaggatiksraŋnik naalaġnisiŋa."
1517," For nothing is hidden except to be revealed, and nothing concealed except to be brought to light. ","Jesus uqallautivsaaŋagai, Naalaġnimmaġiksaaqsiuŋ tusaakkaqsi. Qanutun kaŋiqsisilaaqsi aktilaaqaqtuq naammaŋatun naalaġniḷḷuataqtilaavsi, suli kaŋiqsisaiññaġniaqtusi. "
1518," If anyone has ears to hear, he had better listen!” ","Qanuq iñuk naalaġniḷḷuataqtuaq kaŋiqsipkavsaaqtitauniaqtuq, aasiiḷi iñuk naalaġniḷḷuatalaitchuaq tammaiñiaqtuq kaŋiqsił̣auraġaluakkamiñik."
1519," And he said to them, “Take care about what you hear. The measure you use will be the measure you receive, and more will be added to you. ","Suli Jesus uqallavsaaŋaruq, God-im atanniqsimmataa iñuŋnun arriliñaġumiñaqtuq nunaliqirimun, palauvaksranullu nautchirriutikkaŋiñun. "
1520," For whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him.”","Nunaliqiri siñiksaġaktuq unnuaġman, aasii itiqami uvluġman kukiḷuaqsivḷuni. Aasiivsauq tainna pipkaqługu, palauvaksrat nauyugaqtut nakautchivḷutiŋ. Nunaliqirim nalugai qanuqłutiŋ nautilaaŋat. "
1521," He also said, “The kingdom of God is like someone who spreads seed on the ground. ","Nunam naupkaġai iñugiaksipkaqługich palauvaksrat atautchimiñ palauvaksramiñ.

1522," He goes to sleep and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, though he does not know how. ",Palauvaksrat nauganigluataġmata iñuk kivriñmiñik kivrisaġaqtuq palauvaksranik qanuq kivrivikaaq tikitchuq.
1523," By itself the soil produces a crop, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head. ","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Sumun arriḷiñiaqpigu God-im Atanniqsimmataa iñuŋnun? Sumik uuktuusiġñiaqpigu nausaiññaġniŋa? "
1524," And when the grain is ripe, he sends in the sickle because the harvest has come.”","Arriqaqtuq mustard-mik nautchiaksramik, mikiniqsrapiaġataŋannik nautchiaksrat. Nunaliqirim nautchirriutigaa nunamun. "
1525," He also asked, “To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to present it? ",Qakugulimman nauruq taaniqtusił̣haaqłuni nauriapayaaniñ. Qisiqsiutiġluksivaił̣ł̣uni tiŋmiat ugluliuġvigiŋagaich qisiqsiutiŋi. 
1526," It is like a mustard seed that when sown in the ground, even though it is the smallest of all the seeds in the ground – ","Tavra Jesus alġaqsruituiññaŋaruq iñuŋnun, atuqłuni iñugiaktuanik uuktuutinik allaniglu taapkunatun. Uqautiŋagai kaŋiqsiyumiñaqtilaaŋatiktun. "
1527," when it is sown, it grows up, becomes the greatest of all garden plants, and grows large branches so that the wild birds can nest in its shade.”",Uqautilaiñŋagai uuktuutaiḷḷuni. Aglaan kisiŋŋuqamiŋ supayaat uqautini sivunniuġaġigai iḷitchitquramiñun.
1528," So with many parables like these, he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear. ","Tavra taavrumanisuli uvlumi, unnuksaġman, Jesus iḷitchitqurani uqallautiŋagai, Ikaaqta auŋatchianun tatchim. "
1529, He did not speak to them without a parable. But privately he explained everything to his own disciples.,"Tavra qimaŋagaich iñusalaich, aasii aullautiŋagaat Jesus umiaqpauramun ikianiŋman. Tavraptauq tuvaaqatiqaŋammiut allanik umiaqpauranik. "
1530," On that day, when evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.” ","Tavra anuqqakpaŋaruq, suli malgich iksruġaŋagaat umiaqpauraq, siḷivitkaqsivḷugu. "
1531," So after leaving the crowd, they took him along, just as he was, in the boat, and other boats were with him. ","Tavra Jesus aquaniinŋaruq umiaqpauram, siñikłuni akisiqaqłuni. Aasii itiqsaŋagaat, uqallautivlugu, Iḷisaurrii, suliqutigiŋitpiuŋ ipigupta? "
1532," Now a great windstorm developed and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was nearly swamped. ","Tavra makinŋaruq, suli suaŋagaa anuġi uqallakłuni, Anuġaiġiñ, uqallakłuniḷu immamun, Quunniġuġiñ. Tavra anuġaiŋaruq, quunniġuqłuni. "
1533," But he was in the stern, sleeping on a cushion. They woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, don’t you care that we are about to die?” ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Summan iqsisuvaitpisi? Qanuqimña ukpiġutaitpisi? "
1534," So he got up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Calm down!” Then the wind stopped, and it was dead calm. ","Tavra iliŋich aliuŋarut atqunaqłutiŋ, suli uqaqłutiŋ avanmun, Qanusiq una Iñuk? Anuġimunnii immavlu kamagillavatku."
1535," And he said to them, “Why are you cowardly? Do you still not have faith?” ",
1536," They were overwhelmed by fear and said to one another, “Who then is this? Even the wind and sea obey him!”",
1537," So they came to the other side of the lake, to the region of the Gerasenes. ","Tavra ikaaŋarut taaguŋatchianun tatchim Galilee-m, nunaŋannun Gerasenes. "
1538," Just as Jesus was getting out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came from the tombs and met him. ","Aasii niumman Jesus umiaqpauramiñ, tavrauvvaa paaŋagaa iñuum ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuam iḷuviġniñ. "
1539," He lived among the tombs, and no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain. ","Taamna iñuk iñuuniqsuaq akunġanni iḷuvviviich, aasii kialiqaa qiḷiqsruiḷaiññiġaa, kalimñanikunnii. "
1540," For his hands and feet had often been bound with chains and shackles, but he had torn the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one was strong enough to subdue him. ","Qanuq ilaa akulaił̣ł̣ugu qiḷiqsruigaluaġaġniġaat kalimñanik isigaŋigullu tayaġniŋigullu. Kalimñat kiktuġaaġaġniġai, suli kalimñat isigagmiñiittuat kanuqqivḷugich. Iñulimaam ittuayusipkalaiññiġaa. "
1541," Each night and every day among the tombs and in the mountains, he would cry out and cut himself with stones. ","Aasii ataramik unnuamiḷu uvlumiḷu qimialuŋniitkayugniqsuq iḷuvviviŋniḷu nipaalavluni, kiḷḷiaqłuni ilimiñik uyaġagnun."
1542," When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and bowed down before him. ","Tavra ilaan tautukamiuŋ Jesus uŋasiñun, aqpanŋaruq, aasii pułłuni sivuġaanun. "
1543," Then he cried out with a loud voice, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I implore you by God – do not torment me!” ","Suli nipaalaqpaŋaruq, Jesus, Iġñiŋa sapiġñaġniqsrauruam God-im, suniaqpiŋa? Apiġipiaġikpiñ God-ikun, tatavsaġnaŋa. "
1544," (For Jesus had said to him, “Come out of that man, you unclean spirit!”) ","Qanuq Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Ilitqusiqł̣uuk anniiñ iñuŋmiñ. "
1545," Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “My name is Legion, for we are many.” ","Suli Jesus apiġiŋagaa, Sumik atiqaqpich? Tavra kiuŋagaa, Uvaŋa atiġa Legion, qanuq iñugiaktugut. "
1546, He begged Jesus repeatedly not to send them out of the region. ,Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuam apiġipiaġataŋagaa Jesus aullaqtitquŋił̣ł̣ugich ilitqusiqł̣uich tamattumaŋŋa nunamiñ.
1547," There on the hillside, a great herd of pigs was feeding. ",Aasii tuttuqłusalaich tavraniinniqsut qaniłłutiŋ qimialuŋni niġiñiaqtuat. 
1548," And the demonic spirits begged him, “Send us into the pigs. Let us enter them.” ","Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uich iluqaġmiŋ apiġipiaġataŋagaat, Tillisigut tuttuqługnun, isiġumagivut. "
1549," Jesus gave them permission. So the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. Then the herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake, and about two thousand were drowned in the lake. ","Tavra tavraŋŋa Jesus aullaqtinŋagai. Aasii ilitqusiqł̣uich aniŋarut iñuŋmiñ isiqłutiŋ tuttuqługnun. Tavra tuttuqłuich paŋaliŋarut suamavlutiŋ anmun qutaŋŋiaġiksuakun immamun, aasii ipivlutiŋ.

1550," Now the herdsmen ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside, and the people went out to see what had happened. ","Tavrali qaunaksriruat tuttuqługnik pigruŋarut, aasii quliaqtuaġivlugu taamna iniqpaŋmi nunaaqqiñiḷu. Tavra iñuich qaiŋarut tautugiaqługu suna pisilaaŋanik. "
1551," They came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there, clothed and in his right mind – the one who had the “Legion” – and they were afraid. ","Tavra ullaaŋagaat Jesus, suli tautukługu ilitqusiqł̣uqaŋaruaq iñugiaktuanik, aquppiruaq annuġaaŋavluni qauriŋavluniḷu. Tavra iliŋich iqsitchaŋarut. "
1552," Those who had seen what had happened to the demon-possessed man reported it, and they also told about the pigs. ","Aasii tamatkua tautuktuat quliaqtuaġutiŋagaich iñuich, qanuq pirauŋatilaaŋanik taamna ilitqusiqł̣uqaŋaruaq, tuttuqłuktigullu. "
1553, Then they asked Jesus to leave their region. ,Tavra apiġipiaŋagaat Jesus aullaquvlugu nunamiŋniñ.
1554, As he was getting into the boat the man who had been demon-possessed asked if he could go with him. ,"Tavra ikiaqsimman umiaqpauramun, taavruma ilitqusiqł̣uqaŋaruam apiġipiaŋagaluaġaa nayuġukługu. "
1555," But Jesus did not permit him to do so. Instead, he said to him, “Go to your home and to your people and tell them what the Lord has done for you, that he had mercy on you.” ","Tavra Jesus pipkaŋaitkaa, aglaan uqallautiŋagaa, Aggiiñ avilaitqatiŋnun, aasii quliaqtuaġutilugich qanuq kamanaqtigiruanik Atanġum piraŋiñik iliŋnun, suli naglikkutiqaŋatilaaŋanik iliŋnun. "
1556," So he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis what Jesus had done for him, and all were amazed.","Tavra iñuk aullaŋaruq, aasii quliaqtuagaqsivḷuni qulinun nunaaqqiñun qanuq kamanaqtuanik Jesus savaaġikkaŋiñik ilimiñun. Aasii iluqaġmiŋ iñuich kamasuŋarut."
1557," When Jesus had crossed again in a boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered around him, and he was by the sea. ","Tavra Jesus ikaatqianiŋman umiaqpaurakun taaguŋatchiġmun, iñusalaich katinŋarut ilaanun. Aasii ilaa tatchim siñaaniinŋaruq. "
1558," Then one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, came up, and when he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet. ","Tavra qaiŋaruq iḷaŋat umialiŋnaŋat Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviata, Jairus-mik atilik. Aasii tautukamiuŋ Jesus punŋaruq sivuġaanun. "
1559," He asked him urgently, “My little daughter is near death. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may be healed and live.” ","Aasii qiññuaqtupiaŋaruq uqaqłuni, Paniuraġa amma tuquaqsiuraqtuq. Qaiḷutin aksiugiapiaqugiga iliŋnun iłuaqsitquvlugu iñuuyumauq. "
1560," Jesus went with him, and a large crowd followed and pressed around him.",Tavra Jesus piqasiŋagaa. Suli iñugaaġruich malikługu tatiŋagaat.
1561, Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years. ,Tavra aġnaq suniġluqaqtuaq auŋmik qulit malġugni ukiuni tamaaniinŋaruq. 
1562," She had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all that she had. Yet instead of getting better, she grew worse. ","Taamna aġnaq nagliksaaqtuaq sapunniaqtiqaŋagaluaqtuq iñugiaktuanik taaktinik. Ilaa maniiġutiŋagaluaqtuqunnii nakuusipayaaŋaitchuq, aglaan pigiiḷisaiññaŋaruq. "
1563," When she heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his cloak, ","Tusaaganiŋavluni Jesus-mik, qaiŋaruq tatiruatigun tunuaniñ, aasii aksiukługu Jesus annuġaaŋa, "
1564," for she kept saying, “If only I touch his clothes, I will be healed.” ","isumavluni, aksiuksiññaġupkich unnii annuġaaŋi, iłuaqsiyumiñaqtuŋa. "
1565," At once the bleeding stopped, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. ","Tavra aksiuŋagaa Jesus annuġaaŋa, aasii aunaaqsruŋaiqł̣uni tavrauvvaa. Timimiñi iḷitchuġigaa iłuaqsisilaani naŋirrunmiñiñ. "
1566," Jesus knew at once that power had gone out from him. He turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothes?” ","Tavra Jesus, tavrauvvaa iḷitchuġivluni ilimiñiñ suaŋŋan aullaqtilaaŋanik, kiŋiaŋaruq tatiruani, aasii uqallakłuni, Kia aksiukpagich annuġaatka? "
1567," His disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing against you and you say, ‘Who touched me?’” ","Tavra iḷitchitquraŋisa kiuŋagaat, Tautukkitin iñusalaich tatiruat iliŋnun. Summan aasii apiqsrivich kimun aksiuŋmagaaqpich? "
1568, But he looked around to see who had done it. ,Tavra alaqiñŋaruq avanmun tautugniaqługu kimun aksiuktilaani. 
1569," Then the woman, with fear and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. ","Tavra aġnaq sivuuġallaġmi uulillaġmiḷu, qaiŋaruq Jesus-mun iḷisimavluni iluaqsisilaamiñik, aasii pułłuni sivuġaanun, uqautivlugu iluqaanik iḷumun ittuamik. "
1570," He said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your disease.”","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagaa, Paniuruatiin, ukpiġurvich iłuaqsipkaġaatin. Aullaġiñ tutqiksiḷutin, suli iłuaqsiraulutin naŋirrutiŋniñ."
1571," While he was still speaking, people came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the teacher any longer?” ","Jesus uqaġniaqtillugu, qaiŋarut iḷaŋich kivgat Jairus igluaniñ aasii uqallautivlugu, Paniiñ tuquaniktuq. Iḷaksiaŋaiġuŋ Iḷisaurri. "
1572," But Jesus, paying no attention to what was said, told the synagogue ruler, “Do not be afraid; just believe.” ","Tavra Jesus suliqutigisuŋaġnagu uqallautaat, uqallautiŋagaa umialiŋnaq, Iqsiñak, ukpiqsiññaġiñ. "
1573," He did not let anyone follow him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James. ","Tavra Jesus iñuŋmun maliktinŋaitchuq, aglaan Peter-mun James-mullu John-mullu aniqataanun James. "
1574, They came to the house of the synagogue ruler where he saw noisy confusion and people weeping and wailing loudly. ,"Tavra ilaa tikiñŋaruq igluanun umialiŋnaŋata aŋaiyyuvium, aasii tautukługich tuavaalaruat, tamatkualu qiaqpaktuat. "
1575," When he entered he said to them, “Why are you distressed and weeping? The child is not dead but asleep.” ","Tavra isiqami ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Summan inna pivisi qiavisiḷu? Niviaqsiaġruk tuquŋaitchuq. Siñiksiññaqtuq. "
1576, And they began making fun of him. But he put them all outside and he took the child’s father and mother and his own companions and went into the room where the child was. ,"Tavra iglautigiŋagaat kipagivlugu.

1577," Then, gently taking the child by the hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum,” which means, “Little girl, I say to you, get up.” ","Tavra Jesus tiguŋagaa niviaqsiaġruk argaŋigun, aasii uqallautivlugu, Talitha koum, sivuniqaqtuamik, Niviaqsiaġruuk, uqallautigikpiñ, makittin. "
1578, The girl got up at once and began to walk around (she was twelve years old). They were completely astonished at this. ,"Tavra tavrauvvaa niviaqsiaġruk makinŋaruq, aasii pisuaqłuni. Ukiuqaŋaruq qulit malġugnik. Tavra kamasupiaġataŋarut iñuich. "
1579," He strictly ordered that no one should know about this, and told them to give her something to eat.",Tavra uqautipiaŋagai iñuŋmun iḷitchuġitquŋił̣ł̣ugu. Aasii niġipkaquŋagaa.
1580," Now Jesus left that place and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. ","Tavra Jesus aullaŋaruq tavraŋŋa, aasii tikił̣ł̣uni nunamiñun. Suli iḷitchitquraŋisa maliŋagaat. "
1581," When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue. Many who heard him were astonished, saying, “Where did he get these ideas? And what is this wisdom that has been given to him? What are these miracles that are done through his hands? ","Tavra Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋat tikiñman, iḷisaurrirraqsiŋaruq aŋaiyyuviŋmi.

1582," Isn’t this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And aren’t his sisters here with us?” And so they took offense at him. ","Kaamniġuŋitpauna, Mary-m iġñiŋa, aapiyaŋa James-gum Joses-lu Judas-lu Simon-lu? Aasiisuli nayaaluŋi uvaniinŋitpat itqatigivluta? Tavra iliŋich qanuqpaaŋaliŋarut ilaanun. "
1583," Then Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house.” ","Aasiiḷi Jesus uqallautiŋagai, God-im uqaqtaa nanġausiaqallaruq sumiḷiqaa, nunamiñiaglaan iḷamiñiḷu. "
1584," He was not able to do a miracle there, except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them. ","Tavra Jesus tavrani savakkumiñaiñŋaruq aliuġnaqtuanik, aglaan aksiuŋagai iñukitchuat naŋittuat aasii iłuaqsivḷugich. "
1585, And he was amazed because of their unbelief. Then he went around among the villages and taught.,"Pisigivlugu ilaisa arguasuutaat, Jesus aliuŋaruq."
1586, Jesus called the twelve and began to send them out two by two. He gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ,Aasii Jesus kukiḷuŋaruq nunaaqqiñi iḷisaurrivḷuni. 
1587," He instructed them to take nothing for the journey except a staff – no bread, no bag, no money in their belts – ","Tavra qaitquŋagai ilimiñun qulit malġuk iḷitchitqurat, aasii aullaqtitchaaqsivḷugich malġuullaavlugich. Ilaan suaŋŋasiŋagai ilitqusiqł̣uiyaiḷḷasivḷugich. "
1588, and to put on sandals but not to wear two tunics. ,"Suli piraksriŋagai upaluŋaiyaquŋił̣ł̣ugich sunik iglauniksramiŋnun, aglaan ayauppiuraq kisian, puukataiḷaaġlugich, taquagiḷaaġlugich, maniiḷaaġlugich maniqaġviŋmiŋni, "
1589," He said to them, “Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave the area. ","aluġutiqaquvlugich, aglaan malġugnik qaliġuuraqaquŋił̣ł̣ugiḷḷu. "
1590," If a place will not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.” ","Jesus uqallautivsaaŋagai, Nunaaqqiñun tikitkuvsi tukkuġiyumagisi iñuich aiyugaaqtisi aullaġataġnivsiññun aglaan. "
1591, So they went out and preached that all should repent. ,"Aasii iñuich paġlaŋitpasi naalaġnisuŋitpatigiglu uqalusi, qimakkisigiksi taamna ini aasii piiyaġlugu avyuq isigavsiññiñ. Taamna kilgutauniaqtuq ilaiññun pisuŋisilaaŋanik tusaayugaaġiksuaq. "
1592, They cast out many demons and anointed many sick people with oil and healed them.,"Tavra aullaŋarut, aasii alġaqsruivḷutiŋ iñuich isumalitqiksuksraunivḷugich piḷuunmiŋniñ. "
1593," Now King Herod heard this, for Jesus’ name had become known. Some were saying, “John the baptizer has been raised from the dead, and because of this, miraculous powers are at work in him.” ","Suli anittaiŋarut iñugiaktuanik ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik, suli uqsruqtiqługich olive uqsruanik iñugiaktuat naŋittuat iłuaqsivḷugich."
1594," Others said, “He is Elijah.” Others said, “He is a prophet, like one of the prophets from the past.” ","Tavra umialik Herod tusaaŋaruq iluqaiññik tamatkuniŋa, qanuq Jesus uqautigivlugu uqaluk siaminŋaruq sumulliqaa.

1595," But when Herod heard this, he said, “John, whom I beheaded, has been raised!” ","Allalli uqaŋarut Elijah-univḷugu. Allallivsauq uqaŋarut, uqaqtigigaa God-im, iḷaŋatitun taipkua iŋiḷġaan kamanaqtuat uqaqtiŋisun God-im."
1596," For Herod himself had sent men, arrested John, and bound him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip’s wife, because Herod had married her. ","Tavrali Herod tusaakami uqallaŋaruq, John-guruq aŋiruq tuqqunmiñ, niaquiŋakkaġa. "
1597," For John had repeatedly told Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother’s wife.” ","Qanuq Herod tilisivḷuni aŋuyaktinik tigupkaŋagaa John, aasii qiḷiqsruivḷugu tigutaaġviŋmi pisigivlugu Herodias, aniqanmi Philip nuliaŋa, ilaan nulialiutikkani. "
1598, So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him. But she could not ,"John Paptaiqsim Herod uqallautigaluamiiŋagaa, Nalaunŋaitchuq ilivich tuvaaqasiutigupku aniqarvich nuliaŋa. "
1599," because Herod stood in awe of John and protected him, since he knew that John was a righteous and holy man. When Herod heard him, he was thoroughly baffled, and yet he liked to listen to John. ",Herodias isumamaqłuutiqaŋaruq John-mun tuqutitchumaliqsaallaan. Aglaan Herod-mik piñaiḷutaqaŋaruq. 
1600," But a suitable day came, when Herod gave a banquet on his birthday for his court officials, military commanders, and leaders of Galilee. ","Qanuq Herod-gum John sivuuġagiŋagaa, iḷisimavluni iñulluatautilaaŋanik suli nalaunŋavluni iñuk, piyaqquqtaiḷiŋagaa.

1601," When his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his dinner guests. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want and I will give it to you.” ","Kiisaimmaa Herodias piviksraŋa nalautitpuq. Herod annivia tikiñman niqinaqutimmagich iluqaisa qaukłiich kavamauruat, aŋuyaktillu qaukłiŋich, suġalliruallu Galilee-mi. "
1602," He swore to her, “Whatever you ask I will give you, up to half my kingdom.” ","Tavra Herodias pania isiqłuni kanaakkiumman, Herod iviġaktauŋaruq tuyuġmianiḷu. Aasii umialik uqallaŋaruq niviaqsiamun, Sumik piqaġukkaluaqpich? Aitchuġumiñaġikpiñ supayaamik pigisukkaġnik. "
1603," So she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” Her mother said, “The head of John the baptizer.” ","Tavra unniqsuqłiiŋagaa nalupqinaiqł̣ugu, Supayaamik apiqsriguvich uvamniñ, aitchuutiginiaġiga iliŋnun, avvaġiluġaa unnii umialgunma. "
1604, Immediately she hurried back to the king and made her request: “I want the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.” ,"Tavra niviaqsiaq aniŋaruq, aasii uqallautivlugu aakani, Sumik piqaġugniaqpik? Tavra Herodias uqallaŋaruq, Niaquanik John Paptaiqsim. "
1605," Although it grieved the king deeply, he did not want to reject her request because of his oath and his guests. ","Tavra utiŋaruq qilamiqsruqłuni umialiŋmun, aasii apiqsrivḷuni, Aitchuŋŋa akkupak niaquanik John Paptaiqsim puggutauramun. "
1606," So the king sent an executioner at once to bring John’s head, and he went and beheaded John in prison. ","Tavra umialik atqunaqłuni isumaaŋaruq, aasii unniqsuqłiisini pisigivlugu, pisigivlugiḷḷu tuyuġmiani, ilaan itigaurraqtitchumiñaiñŋagaa. "
1607," He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. ","Tavra tavrauvvaa umialik tilisiŋaruq qaunaksrimik, piraksriivḷuni John niaqua qaġġisitquvlugu. Tavra aullaqłuni, niaquiŋagaa John tigutaaġviŋmi. "
1608," When John’s disciples heard this, they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb.","Aasii qaġġisivlugu niaqua puggutauramun, aitchuutigiŋagaa niviaqsiamun, aasiiḷi niviaqsiam aitchuutigivlugu aakamiñun. "
1609, Then the apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught. ,"Tavra John iḷitchitquraŋi tusaakamiŋ taavrumiŋa, qaivḷutiŋ piŋagaat timaa aasii iḷuviqługu."
1610," He said to them, “Come with me privately to an isolated place and rest a while” (for many were coming and going, and there was no time to eat). ","Tavra tilirauŋaruat iḷitchitqurat utiŋarut Jesus-mun, aasii quliaqtuaġutivlugu supayaanik, savaamiŋniglu, suniglu iḷisaurrutigikkamiŋnik. "
1611, So they went away by themselves in a boat to some remote place. ,"Iñugiaktuat iñuich qairaġaŋarut aullaqsimmaġmiglu niġiḷḷaiqsitaallaisa Jesus-lu iḷitchitquraniḷu kiisaimmaa Jesus uqallautivai iḷitchitqurani, Aullallakta sumun iñuił̣aamun kisimġiuqtuallakkumaugut piḷaiŋaiqsiallagluta. "

1613," As Jesus came ashore he saw the large crowd and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he taught them many things.","Iñugiaktuat iñuich tautukługich aullaġmata, iḷisaġiŋagaich kitkuutilaaŋat.

1615, Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy something for themselves to eat.” ,"Tavra uvlukłiaqsimman iḷitchitquraŋisa ullakługu uqallautiŋagaat, uvlukłivigruaqtuq nunaaqqiiñmiuq maani. "
1616," But he answered them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said, “Should we go and buy bread for two hundred silver coins and give it to them to eat?” ","Aullaqtitkich iñuich, aullaġlutiŋ nunaaqqiñun qanipayaaqtuanun tauqsiġumaut niqiksramiŋnik. "
1617," He said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go and see.” When they found out, they said, “Five – and two fish.” ","Jesus kiuŋagai, ilivsi niġipkaqsigik. Ilaisali apiġiŋagaat, Aullaquvisigut tauqsiġiaquluta 200 taalatun niqiksraŋiññik aasii niġipkaġlugich? "
1618, Then he directed them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. ,"Jesus apiġiŋagai, Qavsiñik punniġutiqaqpisi? Tautugiaqsigik. Tavra iḷitchuġianikamiŋ uqallaŋarut, Tallimanik iqallugniglu malġugnik."

1620," He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves. He gave them to his disciples to serve the people, and he divided the two fish among them all. ","Tavra aquptiŋarut qavsiuttaaqłutiŋ, tallimakipiaguttaqłutiglu, malġukipiaq quliguttaqłutiglu. "

1624," Immediately Jesus made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dispersed the crowd. ","Aasii taapkua niġiruat 5,000-guŋarut aŋutit."
1625," After saying good-bye to them, he went to the mountain to pray. ","Tavra tavrauvvaa Jesus ikitqupiaŋagai iḷitchitqurani umiaqpauramun ayutquvlugich Bethsaida-mun, tatchim taaguŋatchianun, ilaa iñuŋnik aullaqtitchipkaqtilluni. "

1627," He saw them straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. As the night was ending, he came to them walking on the sea, for he wanted to pass by them. ","Tanuġaksimman, umiaqpauraq qitqanuiḷiŋaruq tatchim, aasii Jesus kisimġiuqłuni nunami. "

1633," As they got out of the boat, people immediately recognized Jesus. ","Tavra ikaaganikamiŋ, tikiñŋarut nunaŋannun Gennesaret aasii tulakłutiŋ nunamun. "
1634, They ran through that whole region and began to bring the sick on mats to wherever he was rumored to be. ,"Tavra niuganiŋmata umiaqpauramiñ, tavrauvvaa iñuich iḷisaġiŋagaat Jesus. "
1635," And wherever he would go – into villages, towns, or countryside – they would place the sick in the marketplaces, and would ask him if they could just touch the edge of his cloak, and all who touched it were healed.","Aasii aqpanŋarut iluqaagun nunakun sumulliqaa, qaġġisivḷugich nallaviksuummaisa naŋittuat, tusaaraġikamiŋ sumiitilaaŋanik.

1654," Now when Jesus had left the crowd and entered the house, his disciples asked him about the parable. ","qanuq qamaŋŋamiñ iñuum isumaqaġvianiñ salapqiġaqtut piḷuktuat isumat, tigligaġniġich, iñuaġniġich, "

1661," After Jesus left there, he went to the region of Tyre. When he went into a house, he did not want anyone to know, but he was not able to escape notice. ","Tavra aġnam kiuŋagaa, Aaŋ iḷisaurrii, qimmich niġisuummiut niġġiviich ataanni miqłiqtut iḷakuŋiññik. "

1668, Then Jesus went out again from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee in the region of the Decapolis. ,"Tavra tavrauvvaa siuttak aŋmaŋaruk, suli uqaŋa iłuaqsivḷuni, aasii uqaŋaruq kaŋiqsiñaqsivḷuni. "

1670," After Jesus took him aside privately, away from the crowd, he put his fingers in the man’s ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.

1671," Then he looked up to heaven and said with a sigh, “Ephphatha” (that is, “Be opened”). ",
1672," And immediately the man’s ears were opened, his tongue loosened, and he spoke plainly. ",
1673," Jesus ordered them not to tell anything. But as much as he ordered them not to do this, they proclaimed it all the more. ",
1674," People were completely astounded and said, “He has done everything well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak.”",
1675," In those days there was another large crowd with nothing to eat. So Jesus called his disciples and said to them, ","Taavruma aquqiatchiaŋagun iñusalaich katinŋarut. Niqiksraiñmata, Jesus ququaŋagai iḷitchitqurani inmiñun aasii uqallautivlugich. "

1680," Then he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. After he took the seven loaves and gave thanks, he broke them and began giving them to the disciples to serve. So they served the crowd. ","Tavra iñuich piraksriŋagai aquvitquvlugich nunamun. Tiguvlugich tallimat malġuk punniġich quyyavigiqqaaqługu God, avguŋagai aasii aitchuutigivlugich iḷitchitquramiñun autaaquvlugich iñuŋnun.

1683, There were about four thousand who ate. Then he dismissed them. ,"Tavra iḷitchitqurat katitchiŋarut iḷakunik tallimat malġuk aguummakpaich siḷiviłługich. Taamna pianiŋman, Jesus aullaqtinŋagai iñuich. "
1684, Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.,"Tavra tavrauvvaa ilaa ikiŋaruq umiaqpauramun piqatigivlugich iḷitchitqurani, aasii tikiñŋarut Dalmanutha-mun."
1685," Then the Pharisees came and began to argue with Jesus, asking for a sign from heaven to test him. ","Iḷaŋisa Pharisees ullaŋagaat Jesus aasii uqavaaġutiaqsivḷugu. Uuktuġukługu apiġiŋagaat tautuktitquvlutiŋ aliuġnaqtuamik qiḷaŋmiñ, iḷisimanaqsisaġlugu God-mun iviġaumagitilaaŋa. "
1686," Sighing deeply in his spirit he said, “Why does this generation look for a sign? I tell you the truth, no sign will be given to this generation.” ","Tavra aniqsaapaŋaruq atqunaq, aasii uqallakłuni, Summan makua iñuich apiqsrivat tautugukłutiŋ aliuġnaqtuamik?

1688," Now they had forgotten to take bread, except for one loaf they had with them in the boat. ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat puiguiŋarut punniliraaksramiŋnik, aglaan punniġutiqaŋarut atautchimik umiaqpauramiŋñi. "
1689," And Jesus ordered them, “Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!” ","Tavra Jesus iḷitchitqurani kiliŋagai uqaqłuni, Qaunagisitchi imaksrautiŋiññiñ Pharisees-lu umialguvlu Herod-gum. "
1690, So they began to discuss with one another about having no bread. ,"Iḷitchitqurat uqarraqsiŋarut avanmun, Ilaa uqallaktuq tainna, punniġutaiññapta. "
1691," When he learned of this, Jesus said to them, “Why are you arguing about having no bread? Do you still not see or understand? Have your hearts been hardened? ","Jesus iḷisimavlugu uqautigikkaŋat uqallautiŋagai, Summan uqaaġutigivisiuŋ punniġutaiññiq? Iḷitchuġiŋaitpisi kaŋiqsiŋaił̣ł̣usiḷu? Puqiisigivisi tainnatun? "

1693," When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of pieces did you pick up?” They replied, “Twelve.” ","Avguqapkich tallimat punniġich 5,000-nun iñuŋnun, qavsiñik aguummagnik siḷiviłługich iḷakunik katitchiŋavisi? Iliŋisa kiuŋagaat, Qulit malġugnik. "

1696, Then they came to Bethsaida. They brought a blind man to Jesus and asked him to touch him. ,"Tavra tikiñŋarut Bethsaida-mun, suli qaġġisiŋagaat iñuk ayauŋaruaq Jesus-mun, apiġipiaqługu aksiuquvlugu. "
1697," He took the blind man by the hand and brought him outside of the village. Then he spit on his eyes, placed his hands on his eyes and asked, “Do you see anything?” ","Tavra ilaan tiguŋagaa ayauŋaruaq argaŋigun, aasii aullativlugu annisiŋagaa nunaaqqimiñ.

1699," Then Jesus placed his hands on the man’s eyes again. And he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. ",Taamna pianiŋman Jesus aksiutqiŋagaa irrakkun. Tavrani iñuk qiñimmaġiksaapiaŋaruq aasii tautuksiḷḷasiŋaruq takpiksivḷuni. 
1700," Jesus sent him home, saying, “Do not even go into the village.”","Tavra Jesus aipkaŋagaa igluanun, uqallautivlugu, Nunaaqqimugnak."
1701," Then Jesus and his disciples went to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say that I am?” ","Tavra Jesus-lu iḷitchitquraniḷu aullaŋarut nunaaqqiŋiñun Caesarea Philippi-m.

1704, Then he warned them not to tell anyone about him.,"Jesus piraksriŋagai, Uqautiginagu taamna kimulliqaa."
1705," Then Jesus began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and after three days rise again. ","Tavra Jesus iḷisautirraqsiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Iġñiŋa Iñuum nagliksaaqpaktuksrauruq, pisuŋiññiaġaallu Jew-guruat atanauraŋisa, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu, iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik.

1706, He spoke openly about this. So Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. ,"Ilaan uqautigiŋagaa taamna iliŋiññun kaŋiqsiñaqsipiaqługu. Tavra Peter-m asivaqtaaġutivlugu uqallautiŋagaa, Tainna uqaqtuksrauŋitchutin. "
1707," But after turning and looking at his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, “Get behind me, Satan. You are not setting your mind on God’s interests, but on man’s.”","Tavra Jesus qiviaqługich iḷitchitqurani, suaŋagaa Peter, Satan, piiġiñ uvamniñ.

1708," Then Jesus called the crowd, along with his disciples, and said to them, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow me. ","Tavra Jesus ququaganikamigich iñuich ilimiñun iḷitchitquraniḷu, uqallautiŋagai, Kialiqaa maligukkumiŋa, piruksrauŋitchuq ilaan pisukkamiñik, iqsriutilugu aŋarraurani, itqanaitchuksrauruq tuqutautigiyumiñaġluŋaunnii.

1711, What can a person give in exchange for his life? ,Sumik piitchuq iñuum simmiutiksraŋanik iñuggunmiñun.

1714," Six days later Jesus took with him Peter, James, and John and led them alone up a high mountain privately. And he was transfigured before them, ","Tavra itchaksrat uvlut pianiŋmata, Jesus piqasiutiŋagai Peter-lu James-lu John-lu, aasii mayuutivlugich qutchiksuamun iġġimun kisiisa.

1721," As they were coming down from the mountain, he gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

1816," So they went and found a colt tied at a door, outside in the street, and untied it. ","Tavra aullaŋaruk sivuniġmiŋnun. Suli paqinŋagaak kakaktim nuġġaŋa pituqaqtuaq siḷami apqutini saniġaani upkuam. Pituiġñiaqsaqtillugu, "
1817," Some people standing there said to them, “What are you doing, untying that colt?” ","iḷaŋisa qikaqtuat tavrani uqallautiŋagaik, Summan pituiqpitku kakaktim nuġġaŋa? "
1818," They replied as Jesus had told them, and the bystanders let them go. ","Tavra iliŋikta uqallautiŋagaich, Jesus piraksriutaatun. Tavra iliŋisa aullaqtinŋagaich. "
1819," Then they brought the colt to Jesus, threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. ","Tavra Jesus-mun qaġġisiŋagaak kakaktim nuġġaŋa. Aasii iḷiŋagaich annuġaatiŋ kakaktimun, tavra Jesus kakaksirraqsiŋaruq. "
1820, Many spread their cloaks on the road and others spread branches they had cut in the fields. ,"Tavra iñugiaktuat iñuich isivinŋagaich annuġaatiŋ apqunmun. Allalli kivriŋarut qisiqsiutinik napaaqtuniñ, aasii iḷiuqqaqługich apqutinun. "
1821," Both those who went ahead and those who followed kept shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! ","Tavra iñuich sivulliuruat, aquaguaqtuallu nipaallaŋarut, Hosanna, nanġaqtauli God. God-im piḷḷuataqtilliuŋ qairuaq pisivlugu Ataniq. "
1822, Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest!” ,God-im piḷḷuataqtilliuŋ atanniqsimannikkumaaqtuaq maŋŋuptiktun David-tun. Nanġaqtauli God.
1823," Then Jesus entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. And after looking around at everything, he went out to Bethany with the twelve since it was already late.","Tavra Jesus tikiñŋaruq Jerusalem-mun, aasii isiqłuni aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun.

1824," Now the next day, as they went out from Bethany, he was hungry. ","Tavra uvlaakumman, qaikamiŋ Bethany-miñ, Jesus kaaliŋaruq. "
1825," After noticing in the distance a fig tree with leaves, he went to see if he could find any fruit on it. When he came to it he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. ","Tavra tautukługu fig napaaqtuat uŋasiñiñ akutuqpalik, ilaan ullaŋagaa, iḷaanni paqinnasugaluni fig-nik tavraŋŋa.

1826," He said to it, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” And his disciples heard it.","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Iñupayaam siiġñaqtuġvigiŋaiḷḷisin tavraŋŋaaglaan. Iḷitchitquraŋisa tusaaŋagaat uqallaŋman."
1827," Then they came to Jerusalem. Jesus entered the temple area and began to drive out those who were selling and buying in the temple courts. He turned over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves, ","Tavra tikiñŋarut Jerusalem-mun, aasii Jesus isiŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun.

1828, and he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple courts. ,Suli iñupayaaq saagaqtitchumiñaiñŋagaa supayaamik aŋaiyyuvikuaġlugu. 
1829," Then he began to teach them and said, “Is it not written: ‘My house will be called a house of prayer for all nations’? But you have turned it into a den of robbers!” ","Tavra ilaan iḷisautiŋagai iñuich, Aglausimaruq Bible-ni God-im uqallautaa inna, “Uvaŋa igluqpaga taggisiqaġniaqtuq iñupayaat aŋaiyyuyaqtuġviannik.” Aglaalli ilivsi iriqtuġviḷiutiŋagiksi tigligayuktinun."
1830," The chief priests and the experts in the law heard it and they considered how they could assassinate him, for they feared him, because the whole crowd was amazed by his teaching. ","Tavra pitquranik iḷisaurrit, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu taamna tusaaŋagaat, aasii ivaqłiaŋarut qanuġlugu tuqutchukługu sivuuġagiliqł̣ugu, qanuq iñupayaat aliuŋarut iḷisaurrutiŋigun."
1831," When evening came, Jesus and his disciples went out of the city.","Tavra tanuġaksimman, Jesus-lu iḷitchitquraniḷu aullaŋarut iniqpaŋmiñ."
1832," In the morning as they passed by, they saw the fig tree withered from the roots. ","Tavra uvlaami, nalautchaaqługu fig napaaqtuq tautuŋagaat tuquliŋaruaq maŋŋuġmiñunaglaan. "
1833," Peter remembered and said to him, “Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has withered.” ","Tavra Peter-m itqautivlugu uqallautiŋagaa, Iḷisaurrii, tautuguŋ, fig napaaqtuq tuquliŋaruq uqallautiŋaran siiġñaqtuġvigitquŋił̣ł̣ugu tavraŋŋaaglaan. "
1834," Jesus said to them, “Have faith in God. ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, God-mun ukpiġutiqaġitchi. "
1835," I tell you the truth, if someone says to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.

1837," Whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, so that your Father in heaven will also forgive you your sins.”","Suli qikaqavsi aŋaiyyuvlusi, suliqutigiŋaiġñigitchi itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich sunŋutiqaġuvsi kimulliqaa, Aapavsivsauq qiḷaŋmiittuam suliqutigiŋaiġumagai piḷuutisi itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich. "
1838," They came again to Jerusalem. While Jesus was walking in the temple courts, the chief priests, the experts in the law, and the elders came up to him ","[Ilivsi suliqutigiŋaiġñiŋitkuvsi itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich, Aapavsivsauq qiḷaŋmiittuam suliqutigiŋaiġñiaŋiñmigai itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich piḷuutisi.]"
1839," and said, “By what authority are you doing these things? Or who gave you this authority to do these things?” ","Utiġmata Jerusalem-mun, Jesus pisuaqtillugu aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, qaiŋarut ilaanun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich, iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik, umialiŋnallu, "
1840," Jesus said to them, “I will ask you one question. Answer me and I will tell you by what authority I do these things: ","aasii apiġivlugu, Sum ataniġnaqutaagun tamatkua pivigich? Kia taavrumiŋa ataniġnaqusiqpatin tamatkua pitquvlugich? "
1841, John’s baptism – was it from heaven or from people? Answer me.” ,"Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Apiqsriñiaqtuŋalivsauq ilivsiññiñ atautchimik apiqqunmik. Kiuguvsiŋa, uqallautiniaġivsi qanutchikun ataniġnaqutikun uvaŋa pisilaamnik tamatkuniŋa. "
1842," They discussed with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Then why did you not believe him?’ ","Kia ataniġnaqutiksriñŋavauŋ John paptaiqsiñiksraŋagun, God-im naagga iñuum? "
1843," But if we say, ‘From people – ’” (they feared the crowd, for they all considered John to be truly a prophet). ","Tavra uqavaaŋarut avanmun uqaqłutiŋ, Uqallakkupta God-miŋŋaqtauniḷugu ilaa uqallagniaqtuq, Summanmi ilivsi John ukpiġiŋaitpisiuŋ? "
1844," So they answered Jesus, “We don’t know.” Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”","Suli uqaġumiñaitchugut ataniġnaqutaa iñuŋniñ piñiḷugu. Iliŋisa sivuuġagiŋagaich iñuich, qanuq iñupayaat nalupqigiŋaitkaat John God-mun uqaqtautilaaŋa. "
1845," Then he began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, dug a pit for its winepress, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went on a journey. ","Tavra Jesus uqautirraqsiŋagai iñuich uuktuutitigun.

"
1846, At harvest time he sent a slave to the tenants to collect from them his portion of the crop. ,Katitchiñiksraq siiġñanik nalautinman nunaqaqtuaq tilisiŋaruq kivgamik napaaqsiqirinun pisukługich autaaġusiaksrautini siiġñat. 
1847," But those tenants seized his slave, beat him, and sent him away empty-handed. ","Tavra napaaqsiqirit tigguġluŋagaat kivgaq, aasii anaullaqługu. Suli aullaqtinŋagaat saagaiḷaaqługu. "
1848, So he sent another slave to them again. This one they struck on the head and treated outrageously. ,Tavra iñua siiġñaqaġvium tilisiŋaruq allamik kivgamik. Napaaqsiqirit anaumiŋagaat niaquagun aulataġivlugulu kanŋunaqtuakun. 
1849," He sent another, and that one they killed. This happened to many others, some of whom were beaten, others killed. ","Tavra tilisitqiḷgitchuq allamik kivgamik aasii napaaqsiqirit tuqunŋagaat. Allanik iñugiaktuanik tilisiŋaruq aasii iḷaŋich anauttaŋagaich, iḷaŋich suli tuqułługich. "
1850," He had one left, his one dear son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’ ","Tavra iġñiqaqłuni atautchimik, piviuttaġipiakkamiñik, ilaan tiliŋammigaa napaaqsiqirinun aqulliuvlugu, uqaqłuni, Taluġiniaġaat iġñiġa. "
1851," But those tenants said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’ ","Tavra taapkua uqaŋarut inmiŋni, Tavra kiŋuvaannaktuksraun. Qaisitchi. Tuqullakput, aasii kiŋuvaannaktaksrautaa piginiaġikput. "
1852," So they seized him, killed him, and threw his body out of the vineyard. ","Tavra tigguġluŋagaat iġñiq tuqunŋagaat, aasii annisivlugu timaa siiġñaqaġviŋmiñ."
1853, What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others. ,"Qanuġniaqpaasiiñ iñua siiġñaqaġvium? Qaiñiaqtuq aasii tuqullugich napaaqsiqirit, aasii atukkirrutigilugu siiġñaqaġvik allanun. "
1854, Have you not read this scripture:,Qaŋaunnii taiguaŋaitpisi uqaluŋnik Bible-ni inna?
1855,‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.,Iḷaŋich Pharisees iḷaŋiḷḷu Herod-kuayaat tilirauŋarut Jesus-mun uuktuġukługu apiqsruqtuutinik. 
1856," This is from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”","Tavra ullakamirruŋ uqallautiŋagaat, Iḷisaurrii, iḷisimarugut pitqiksiġautaisilaaġnik.

1857," Now they wanted to arrest him (but they feared the crowd), because they realized that he told this parable against them. So they left him and went away.","Akiḷiiruksrauvisa, naagga akiḷiiñiaŋitpisa? Tavra Jesus, iḷisimavlugu pisaaŋŋuaġutaat, uqallautiŋagai, Summan uuktuqpisiŋa? Qaġġirrisiŋa maniuramik tautukkumagiga. "
1858, Then they sent some of the Pharisees and Herodians to trap him with his own words. ,"Tavra maniuraq qaġġisiŋagaat. Aasii ilaan apiġiŋagai, Kiñauna maniurami atqalu? Tavra iliŋisa kiuŋagaat, Caesar. "
1859," When they came they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and do not court anyone’s favor, because you show no partiality but teach the way of God in accordance with the truth. Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or shouldn’t we?” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Aitchuutigisigik Caesar-mun sut pigikkaŋi Caesar-m, aasii God-mun sut pigikkaŋi God-im. Tavra ilaa kamasuutigiŋagaat."
1860," But he saw through their hypocrisy and said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it.” ",Tavra Sadducees ullautiŋarut Jesus-mun. Taapkua iñuich uqaġuuruat aŋiniaŋiññivḷugich iñuich tuqqunmiñ. 
1861," So they brought one, and he said to them, “Whose image is this, and whose inscription?” They replied, “Caesar’s.” ","Iliŋisa uqallautiŋagaat, Iḷisaurrii, uvaptiŋnun Jew-guruanun Moses aglaŋaruq uumiŋa pitquramik, Iñuum aniqataa tuqukpan, qimaglugu nuliani miqłiqsigaluaġnani, aniqataanun tuvaaqasiutitquvlugu nuliaŋa, aasii qitunġiuġluni aniqatini pisilugu. "
1862," Then Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” And they were utterly amazed at him.","Tavra tallimat malġuuŋarut aniqatigiich. Aasii aŋayukłiq nuliaŋaruq, aasii tuquvluni kiŋuvaaligaluaġnani. "
1863," Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) also came to him and asked him, ","Tavra tugliata nuliaŋagaa, aasii tuquŋaruq, kiŋuvaaligaluaġnanisuli. Piŋayuak suli tuquŋammiuq. "
1864," “Teacher, Moses wrote for us: ‘If a man’s brother dies and leaves a wife but no children, that man must marry the widow and father children for his brother.’ ","Tavra tallimat malġuk nuliaŋagaat, aasii kiŋuvaaliŋaitchut. Aqulliuvluni iluqaŋiññiñ aġnaq tuquŋammiuq. "
1865," There were seven brothers. The first one married, and when he died he had no children. ","Tavra aŋŋiviŋmi, aŋikpata nalliata nuliaġiniaqpauŋ? Qanuq tallimat malġuk nuliaġiŋagaat."
1866," The second married her and died without any children, and likewise the third. ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Qanutun killukuaqtigirusi. Killukuaġutigigiksi naluvlugich Bible uqaluŋich, God-ivlu suaŋŋataa. "
1867," None of the seven had children. Finally, the woman died too. ","Qanuq aŋigumiŋ tuqqunmiñ, aŋutillu aġnallu katitinniaŋitchut, aglaan inniaqtut isaġuliktitun qiḷaŋmiittuatun. "
1868," In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For all seven had married her.” ","Aasii sivuniġilugu uqaqta tuquŋaruat aŋiñiaġniŋat.

1870," For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. ","Tavra iḷisaurri pitquranik tavraniinŋaruq naalaġniruaq uqaaġutiŋiññik.

1871," Now as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God said to him, ‘I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Qaukłiat pitqurapayaat innaittuq, Naalaġnisiŋa Israel-guruasii. Ataniq God-ikput kisimisualuk Atanġuruq. "
1872, He is not the God of the dead but of the living. You are badly mistaken!”,"Aasii piviuttaġipiaqsaġiñ Ataniq God-igikkan, piviuttaġilugu iḷuŋniñ, iluqaaniḷu iñuuniaġniġni, iluqaaniḷu isumaniġni, iluqaaniḷu piḷġusiġñi. "
1873," Now one of the experts in the law came and heard them debating. When he saw that Jesus answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” ","Aasii tuglia qaukłiuruam pitquram innaittuq, Piviuttaġisaġiñ siḷalliñ iliktun iḷiḷugu. Allamik pitquraitchuq qaukłiułhaaqtuamik taapkuŋnaŋŋa. "
1874," Jesus answered, “The most important is: ‘Listen, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. ","Tavra iḷisaurrim pitquranik uqallautiŋagaa, Nalauttutin Iḷisaurrii. Uqallausiġigiñ iḷumun ittuaq, qanuq God atausiuruq. God-aitchuq allamik aglaan God kisimi. "
1875," Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.’ ","Suli iñuum piviuttaġipiagaksraġigaa God iḷumiñiñ, iluqaani isumaniġmiñi, iluqaaniḷu piḷġusimiñi, aasiisuli piviuttaġipiaġmiḷugu siḷalliñi ilimisun iḷiuġlugu.

1876, The second is: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.” ,"Tavra Jesus puttuqsrikamiuŋ kiggutaa isumattutikun, ilaan uqallautiŋagaa, Itqanaitkavsakkaluaqtutin God-mun atanniqsimapkaġniksraġnun.

1877," The expert in the law said to him, “That is true, Teacher; you are right to say that he is one, and there is no one else besides him. ","Jesus iḷisaurriñiallaġmi Aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi apiqsriŋaruq, Qanuqłutiŋ iḷisaurrit pitquranik uqallakkumiñaqpat Christ-guruaq kiŋuniġiniaġnivḷugu David-mun? "
1878," And to love him with all your heart, with all your mind, and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.” ","Qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallaktinŋagaa David inna,"
1879," When Jesus saw that he had answered thoughtfully, he said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” Then no one dared any longer to question him.","Tavra Jesus iḷisaurriḷḷaġmi iñuŋnik uqallautiŋagai, Qaunagisitchi iḷisaurriñiñ pitquranik kukiḷullaturuaniñ akuqturuanik annuġaaqaqłutiŋ iḷisimatquvlutiŋ suutilaamiŋnik aasii iñupayaanun purvigitquvlutiŋ tauqsiqsuġviŋñi. "
1880," While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said, “How is it that the experts in the law say that the Christ is David’s son? ","Iliŋich aquppiutaksrallatummiut kamanaqtuat aquppiutaŋiññik aŋaiyyuviŋñi, suli kamanaqtuat aquppiutaŋiññi aquppiḷḷatuvlutiŋ niqinaqimmata. "
1881," David himself, by the Holy Spirit, said,","Iḷaŋisasuli ivayaqtuġmiraġigaich uiḷgaŋaruat igluŋiññiglu tigligaivḷugich, aasii taimma maniugaqsivḷutiŋ nakuurualivḷutiŋ takiruanik aŋaiyyuvlutiŋ. Tamatkua pisigilugich, tatavsausiaŋat pigiił̣haaġniaqtuq."

1885," If David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him with delight. ","Qanuq iluqaġmiŋ ikisiŋarut piukkaġniġmiŋniñ, aasiiḷi uiḷgaŋaruaq pisuksiuniġmiñiñ ikisiŋaruq iluqaanik pimiñik, iñuusautiksratualuŋmiñikunnii."
1886," In his teaching Jesus also said, “Watch out for the experts in the law. They like walking around in long robes and elaborate greetings in the marketplaces, ",
1887, and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. ,
1888," They devour widows’ property, and as a show make long prayers. These men will receive a more severe punishment.”",
1889," Then he sat down opposite the offering box, and watched the crowd putting coins into it. Many rich people were throwing in large amounts. ",
1890," And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, worth less than a penny. ",
1891," He called his disciples and said to them, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put more into the offering box than all the others. ",
1892," For they all gave out of their wealth. But she, out of her poverty, put in what she had to live on, everything she had.”",
1893," Now as Jesus was going out of the temple courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look at these tremendous stones and buildings!” ","Tavra Jesus aniñiaqtillugu aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmiñ, iḷaŋat iḷitchitquraŋisa uqallaŋaruq ilaanun kamatchakłuni, Iḷisaurrii, tautukkich, qanutun kamanaqtigirut makua uyaġaich.

1895," So while he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately, ",Tavra Jesus aquppiŋaruq iġġiani Olives qiñiqługu aŋaiyyuvikpak. Peter-lu James-lu John-lu Andrew-lu ullautiŋarut ilaanun iñuiġman.

1898," Many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am he,’ and they will mislead many. ","Qanuq iñugiaktuat iñuich qaiñiaqtut uvaŋauŋŋuaqtuat uqaġlutiŋ, Uvaŋa Christ-guruŋa, aasii iñugiaktuat sagluqilugich. "

1984," Then they led Jesus to the high priest, and all the chief priests and elders and experts in the law came together. ",Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iluqaġmiglu uqaqsitaaqtitchirit pasikkutiksraqsiuŋagaat Jesus tuqutchumiñaqsisukługu. Aglaan paqitchiḷaiñŋarut. 
1985," And Peter had followed him from a distance, up to the high priest’s courtyard. He was sitting with the guards and warming himself by the fire. ",Iñugiaktuat iñuich sagluuŋarut iḷisimaniruat ilaagun pasikkutiksranik. Suli uqaluŋich atilaiñŋarut.
1986," The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death, but they did not find anything. ","Tavra iñuich iḷaŋich makinŋarut, aasii saglunik uqaqłutiŋ ilaagun. "
1987," Many gave false testimony against him, but their testimony did not agree. ","Tusaaŋagikput uqallaŋman, Suksraunġiġñiaġiga una aŋaiyyuvikpak savaaŋat iñuich, aasii uvlut piŋasut sippiġaluaġnagich savagniaqtuŋa allamik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmik iñuich savaaġiŋisaŋannik. "
1988, Some stood up and gave this false testimony against him: ,Naaggaptauqsuli uqaluŋich atiŋaitchut.
1989," “We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this temple made with hands and in three days build another not made with hands.’” ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat makinŋaruq qitqannun, aasii apiġivlugu Jesus, Kiggutiksraitpich ukua iñuich uqaluŋiññun ilipkun? "

1991," Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, “Have you no answer? What is this that they are testifying against you?” ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Tavrauruŋa. Aasii ilivsi tautugniaġiksi Iġñiŋa Iñuum aquppiruaq taliqpiata tuŋaani Sapiġñaqtuam, suli qairuaq nuvuyaŋigun qiḷaum. "
1992," But he was silent and did not answer. Again the high priest questioned him, “Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?” ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata aliktuŋagai annuġaani suli uqaqłuni, Iñuvsaanik pasiññiktuksranik ilaanik piqaqtuksrauŋaiqsugut. "
1993," “I am,” said Jesus, “and you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming with the clouds of heaven.” ",Tusaaganikkiksi God-itun iḷiuqtuaq inmiñik. Qanuq sivunniqpisiuŋ? Tavra iluqaġmiŋ sivunniŋagaat tuqutauruksraġuqługu.
1994," Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, “Why do we still need witnesses? ","Tavra iñuich iḷaŋisa tivvuaqturraqsiŋagaat Jesus, suli matuvlugu kiiñaŋa qakiqtaqługu uqaqłutiŋ, Nalautchaġiñ kimun qakiqtilaaġnik. Suli qaunaksrit tiguvlugu pattaŋagaat."
1995, You have heard the blasphemy! What is your verdict?” They all condemned him as deserving death. ,"Tavra Peter siḷalliġmiitillugusuli, iḷaŋat Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata niviaqsiaq kivgaŋa tavruunnaaŋaruq. "
1996," Then some began to spit on him, and to blindfold him, and to strike him with their fists, saying, “Prophesy!” The guards also took him and beat him.","Aasii tautukamiuŋ Peter pasiaqtuaq, takunnaŋagaa aasii uqallautivlugu, Ilivitchauq piqatigimmikkan Jesus Nazareth-miu. "
1997," Now while Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the high priest’s slave girls came by. ","Tavra Peter piiḷaaŋaruq, Nalugiga. Kaŋiqsiŋitchuŋaunnii sumik uqaqtilaaġnik. Tavra aniŋaruq aniiġviŋmun, aasii tiŋmiaq nipanŋaruq. "
1998," When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked directly at him and said, “You also were with that Nazarene, Jesus.” ","Tavra niviaqsiam kivgam taututqiŋagaa, aasii uqautiaqsivḷugich tamaani qikaqtuat, Unauvva iḷaŋat. "
1999," But he denied it: “I don’t even understand what you’re talking about!” Then he went out to the gateway, and a rooster crowed. ","Tavra Peter piiḷaatqiŋaruq. Suli akkuliurallaŋman, tamatkua qikaqtuat saniġaani uqallatqiŋarut Peter-mun, Iḷumun iḷagigaatin, qanuq Galilee-ġmiugummiutin. "
2000," When the slave girl saw him, she began again to say to the bystanders, “This man is one of them.” ","Tavra Peter suammakłuni uqallaŋaruq, God-im tatavsaġliŋa uqaŋitkuma iḷumun ittuamik. Nalugiga kiutilaaŋa iñuk uqautigikkaqsi. "

2002," Then he began to curse, and he swore with an oath, “I do not know this man you are talking about!” ",
2003," Immediately a rooster crowed a second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” And he broke down and wept.",
2004," Early in the morning, after forming a plan, the chief priests with the elders and the experts in the law and the whole Sanhedrin tied Jesus up, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate. ","Tavra uvlaatchaurami aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich umialiŋnallu iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik iluqaġmiglu uqaqsitaaqtitchirit kasimaliqtuayaaŋarut sivunniuqłutiŋ.

2005," So Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He replied, “You say so.” ","Tavra Pilate apiġiŋagaa, Umialigivatin Jews? Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Uqallausiġigiñ. "
2006, Then the chief priests began to accuse him repeatedly. ,Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich pasiŋagaat iñugiaktuatigun sutigun. 
2007," So Pilate asked him again, “Have you nothing to say? See how many charges they are bringing against you!” ","Tavra Pilate-gum apiġitqiŋagaa, Kiggutiksraitpich? Qanutun uvva iñugiaktigiruanik pasigaatin. "
2008," But Jesus made no further reply, so that Pilate was amazed. ",Tavra Jesus kiuŋiḷgitchuqsuli. Tavra Pilate kamatchaktuq.
2009," During the feast it was customary to release one prisoner to the people, whomever they requested. ","Tavra niqinaqilimaaġmata qulaurrusiqiviŋmik, Pilate annaktitkayukkaa atausiq tigutaaqtaq, kiñapayaaq pisuŋmarruŋ. "
2010, A man named Barabbas was imprisoned with rebels who had committed murder during an insurrection. ,Tavrani iñuk inŋaruq atilik Barabbas-mik tigutaaqtauqatauruaq iñuŋnun tuavaallaktitchiññiktuanun iñuaŋavlutiŋ. 
2011," Then the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to release a prisoner for them, as was his custom. ",Tavra iñusalaich nipaalavlutiŋ qasiḷiaqsiŋagaat Pilate pitquvlugu piḷġusikaamisun ilimiŋnun. 
2012," So Pilate asked them, “Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?” ","Tavra Pilate-gum apiġiŋagai, Tigutaaqtauŋaiqsitquvisiuŋ uvamnun umialgat Jews? "
2013, (For he knew that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.) ,Qanuq ilaa iḷisimalluataŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun aitchuutigiŋatilaaŋanik killuġivlugu.

2015," So Pilate spoke to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one you call king of the Jews?” ","Tavra Pilate-gum apiġitqiŋagai, Qanuquvisiuŋ aasii uvamnun ilivsi taikkaqsi Umialgannik Jews? "
2016," They shouted back, “Crucify him!” ","Iliŋisa saqłautiŋagaat, kikiaktuutili. "
2017," Pilate asked them, “Why? What has he done wrong?” But they shouted more insistently, “Crucify him!” ","Tavra Pilate-gum uqallautiŋagai, Summan? Sumik pitquramik navgiŋava? Tavra saqłautivsaaqsiññaŋagaat atqunapiaġataq, Kikiaktuutili. "
2018," Because he wanted to satisfy the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas for them. Then, after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over to be crucified.","Tavra Pilate-gum, iviġagumavlugich iñuich, tigutaaqtauŋaiqsinŋagaa Barabbas. Aasii aitchuutigiŋagaa Jesus ipiġaqtuqtitanikamiuŋ kikiaktuutitquvlugu aŋarrauramun."
2019," So the soldiers led him into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort. ","Tavra aŋuyaktit itqutiŋagaat Jesus Pilate-gum igluqpaŋanun, aasii katitquŋagaich iḷakut aŋuyaktit atautchimun. "
2020," They put a purple cloak on him and after braiding a crown of thorns, they put it on him. ","Tavra atipkaŋagaat annuġaanik suŋauraammaġiksuanik umialiktun, suli niaquġusiŋarut kakiḷḷaġnaqtuanik qisiqsiutinik, aasii iḷivḷugu niaquanun. "
2021," They began to salute him: “Hail, king of the Jews!” ","Tavra iliŋisa kipagivlugu nanġarraqsiŋagaat uqaqłutiŋ, Sivisuruamik iñuuli Umialgat Jews. "
2022, Again and again they struck him on the head with a staff and spit on him. Then they knelt down and paid homage to him. ,"Suli anaullaŋagaat niaquagun qiruatchiamik, tivvuaqtuqługulu. Suli kipagivlugu sitquġvigiŋagaat purvigivlugulu. "
2023," When they had finished mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.","Tavra kipagianikamirruŋ, mattaqtinŋagaich suŋauraammaġiksuat annuġaat ilaaniñ, aasii annuġaaqługu ilaan annuġaaŋiñik, aasii aullautivlugu kikiaktuutiyaqtuqługu."
2024," The soldiers forced a passerby to carry his cross, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country (he was the father of Alexander and Rufus). ","Iglaullaġmiŋ aŋuyaktit paaŋagaat iñuk atiqaqtuaq Simon-mik, tikitchaqtuqtuaq iniqpaŋmun imaŋŋa nunamiñ. Tavra nunuriŋagaat iqsruquvlugu ilaanun Jesus aŋarrauraŋa.

2025," They brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which is translated, “Place of the Skull”). ","Tavra Jesus tikiutiŋagaat inimun Golgotha-mun, sivuniqaqtuamun Inaanik Niaquġruam. "
2026," They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. ","Tavra imiksriñŋagaat wine-mik avuuŋaruamik Myrrh-mik, aasii imiŋaitkaa. "
2027," Then they crucified him and divided his clothes, throwing dice for them, to decide what each would take. ","Tavra kikiaktuutianikamirruŋ, autaaŋagaich annuġaaŋi, saaptautigivlugich nalliannik iñullaa piñiaqtilaaŋanik. "
2028, It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him. ,Nainukłaaġman uvlaami kikiaktuutiŋagaat. 
2029," The inscription of the charge against him read, “The king of the Jews.” ","Suli aglaich pasikkusiaŋi iḷiŋagaich niaquata qulaanun uqaluqaqtuat inna, “Umialgat Jews.” "
2030," And they crucified two outlaws with him, one on his right and one on his left. ","Suli tuvaaqasiqł̣ugu kikiaktuutiŋagaich malġuk tigligayuktik, atausiq taliqpiata tuŋaanun, suli igḷua saumiata tuŋaanun. "
2031," Those who passed by defamed him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who can destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, ","[Tavra Bible uqaluat taŋŋiŋaruq, uqaluqaqtuaq, “Ilaa kisiuqatauŋaruq piḷuktualiqirinun.”]"
2032, save yourself and come down from the cross!” ,"Iñuich tamaunnaaqtuat Jesus niaqulavigiraġaŋagaat nivliativlugulu pisaaŋŋatinik, Yaqhii, suksraunġiiyumaaqtuatiin imña aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmik aasii nappatqigḷugu uvluni piŋasuni, "
2033," In the same way even the chief priests – together with the experts in the law – were mocking him among themselves: “He saved others, but he cannot save himself! ","annauttuiñ iliŋnik, atqaġiḷḷu aŋarrauramiñ. "
2034," Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now, that we may see and believe!” Those who were crucified with him also spoke abusively to him.","Tainnatuttauq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik, kipagivlugu uqaŋarut ilimiŋnun, Annaurriŋagaluaqtuq allanik, ilimiñik annautilaitchuq.

2035," Now when it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon. ","Tautuglakput Christ umialgat Israel, atqaġli aŋarrauramiñ akkupak ukpiġiliġumagikput. Suli malġuk kikiaktuurrauqatauruak Jesus-mun pisaaŋaŋammigaak."
2036," Around three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” ","Tavra uvluq qitiqqaġman, taaqsiŋaruq iluqani nuna piŋasunugataqtillugu. "
2037," When some of the bystanders heard it they said, “Listen, he is calling for Elijah!” ","Tavra piŋasunuŋman Jesus nivliŋaruq nipatuvluni, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, sivuniqaqtuaq, God-iiŋ, God-iiŋ, summan suksraaqpiŋa? "
2038," Then someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Leave him alone! Let’s see if Elijah will come to take him down!” ","Tavra iḷaŋisa qikaqtuat saniġaani tusaakamirruŋ, uqallaŋarut, Ququulagaa Elijah. "
2039, But Jesus cried out with a loud voice and breathed his last. ,"Tavra iñuk aqpanŋaruq aasii immiqł̣ugu ivsaktaqtuaq wine-mik, iḷivḷugu qiruum nuvuanun, aitchuŋagaa imiquvlugu uqallautivlugich, Aannagu. Naipiqtuġlakput Elijah qaiñiaġmagaan atqaġiaġlugu. "
2040," And the temple curtain was torn in two, from top to bottom. ","Tavra Jesus nivliŋaruq nipatuvluni, aasii aniġniġiqł̣uni. "
2041," Now when the centurion, who stood in front of him, saw how he died, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!” ",Tavra talukiyaaŋa aŋaiyyuvikpaum aliŋaruq malġuułłuni qulimiñiñ ataanun. 
2042," There were also women, watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. ","Tavra aŋuyaktit atanauraŋata, qikaqtuam akiani, tusaakamiuŋ tainna nivliqsuaq aniġniġiġmallu, uqallaŋaruq, Iḷumun una iñuk Iġñiġiniġaa God-im. "
2043," When he was in Galilee, they had followed him and given him support. Many other women who had come up with him to Jerusalem were there too.","Tavranivsauq aġnat qiñiŋarut uŋasiñiñ. Iḷagiŋagaich Salome, Mary-ḷu Magdalene, suli Mary aakaŋak James-lu kamanaiññiqsram Joses-lu. "
2044," Now when evening had already come, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath), ",Taapkua aġnat maliġiŋakkaŋat Jesus Galilee-miinman pamaġivlugu. Allattauq iñugiaktuat aġnat tavraniinŋarut maliŋaruat Jerusalem-muŋman.
2045," Joseph of Arimathea, a highly regarded member of the council, who was himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. ",Tanuġaksiaqsimman Joseph Arimathea-ġmiu tikiñŋaruq. 
2046, Pilate was surprised that he was already dead. He called the centurion and asked him if he had been dead for some time. ,"Ilaa isumakkusiaqaġluataqłuni iḷauruaq aŋaiyyuvikpaum uqaqsitaaqtitchiriŋiñun, niġiuktuaguruaq tikiññiksraŋanun God-im atanniqsimannigniksraŋanik iñuŋnun.

2048," After Joseph bought a linen cloth and took down the body, he wrapped it in the linen and placed it in a tomb cut out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone across the entrance of the tomb. ","Tavra iḷitchuġianikamiuŋ aŋuyaktit atanauraŋanniñ, pitquŋagaa timaa Jesus Joseph-mun. "
2049, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where the body was placed.,"Tavra Joseph tauqsiŋaruq qatiqtuamik ukił̣haaġiksuamik, aasii atqaqługu Jesus timaa, suli nimmaaqługu qatiqtuamik ukił̣haaġiksuamik iḷiŋagaa iḷuvviviŋmun nayuurramun uyaġakun.

2050," Now many have undertaken to compile an account of the things that have been fulfilled among us, ",Iñulluatapiaġatamun Theophilus-mun.
2051, like the accounts passed on to us by those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning. ,Iñugiaktuat iñuich pisuqtilaamiktun aglautiŋagaich sut piŋaruat akunnaptiŋni. 
2052," So it seemed good to me as well, because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning, to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus, ",Tamatkuniŋa quliaqtuaġutiŋagaatigut iñuich qiñiŋaruat tamatkua pimmata isuaniñqaŋa.

2054," During the reign of Herod king of Judea, there lived a priest named Zechariah who belonged to the priestly division of Abijah, and he had a wife named Elizabeth, who was a descendant of Aaron. ","Aasiuvva aglautiŋagitka tamatkua, iḷisimatquvlutin iḷumun itilaaŋannik iḷisausiaġiŋakkatin."
2055," They were both righteous in the sight of God, following all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly. ","Herod iñuuŋŋaan umialguruaq Judea-mi, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaqaŋaruq atiqaqtuamik Zechariah-mik. Aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi savaqatauŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun taiguutiqaqtuanun Abijah-m piqatiŋiñik.

2056," But they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both very old. ","Tavra iluqatik nalaunŋarualiqirauŋaruk sivuġaani God-im, kamagivlugich iluqaisa pitquraŋi Atanġum pasiñaġumiñaił̣ł̣utik. "
2057," Now while Zechariah was serving as priest before God when his division was on duty, ","Aglaan miqłiqtuiñŋaruk, qanuq Elizabeth miqłiqsiḷaiñŋaruq, suli iluqatik utuqqaliŋaruk."
2058," he was chosen by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to enter the holy place of the Lord and burn incense. ","Abijah-m piqatiŋi tikiutimmagich savaŋniksraŋata aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, Zechariah-m savautiŋagaa God aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauvluni. "
2059, Now the whole crowd of people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering. ,"Aasii aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich piḷġusiatigun, Zechariah nalunaiqsauŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauruksrauvluni ikipkaiḷuni tivraġiksaunmik. Ilaa isiŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋanun Atanġum ikipkaiviŋmun tivraġiksaunmik. "
2060," An angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense, appeared to him. ","Tavra Zechariah ikipkaipkaqtillugu tivraġiksaunmik, iluqaġmiŋ iñusalaich aŋaiyyuŋarut siḷataani. "
2061," And Zechariah, visibly shaken when he saw the angel, was seized with fear. ","Tavra tavrani Atanġum isaġulga niptaŋaruq, makitavluni taliqpiata tuŋaani ikipkaivium tivraġiksaunmik. "
2062," But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zechariah, for your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son; you will name him John. ","Tavra Zechariah-m tautukkamiuŋ isaġulik tupaŋaruq, iqsitchaŋaruġlu. "
2063," Joy and gladness will come to you, and many will rejoice at his birth, ","Tavra isaġulgum uqallautiŋagaa, Iqsiñak Zechariah, qanuq God-im tusaaŋagaa aŋaiyyutin, aasii nulian Elizabeth iġñiqaġniaqtuq. John-mik atchiġñiaġiñ. "
2064," for he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He must never drink wine or strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth. ","Tavra quviasuutiqpaqaġniaqtutin, suli iñugiaktuat iñuich quviasuutiqpaqaġniaqtut anikpan. "
2065, He will turn many of the people of Israel to the Lord their God. ,"Qanuq ilaa kamanaġniaqtuq sivuġaani Atanġum, suli imiġniaŋitchuq wine-mik naaggaunnii imiŋasiñaqtuamik, suli immiqsauniaqtuq Ilitqusiġiksuamik aniñiġmiñiñqaŋa. "
2066," And he will go as forerunner before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers back to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready for the Lord a people prepared for him.”",Ilaan utiġuliqsinniaġai iñugiaktuat Israel-guruat ukpiġuliqsillugich Ataniġmun God-iŋannun. 
2067," Zechariah said to the angel, “How can I be sure of this? For I am an old man, and my wife is old as well.” ","Tavra Ataniq qaiŋaiñŋaan, taamna John alġaqsruiñiaqtuq Elijah-m alġaqsruisiatun suaŋŋatiqaġniŋatullu.

2068," The angel answered him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to bring you this good news. ","Tavra Zechariah uqallaŋaruq isaġuliŋmun, Qanuġlugu iḷisimaniaqpigu taamna piñiaqtilaaŋanik? Qanuq aŋayuqaaŋaruŋa, nuliaġasuli aaquaŋammiuq. "
2069," And now, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time, you will be silent, unable to speak, until the day these things take place.”","Tavra isaġulgum kiuŋagaa, Uvaŋa Gabriel-guruŋa, savaktiŋa God-im iviġaumagivluŋa, aasii tilirauŋaruŋa uqautitquvlutin taavrumiŋa tusaayugaaġiksuamik. "
2070," Now the people were waiting for Zechariah, and they began to wonder why he was delayed in the holy place. ","Qanuq ukpiġiŋiññapkich uqalutka, nalaunniaqtuat piviksramikkun, nipaiññiaqtutin uqalaitchuatun iñuktun tikiḷġataġlugu uvluq tamatkua nalaurviksraŋat."
2071," When he came out, he was not able to speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the holy place, because he was making signs to them and remained unable to speak. ","Tavrali iñuich utaqqiŋagaat Zechariah, suli isummatigiŋagaat muluvluni isiġmiuniŋa aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi. "
2072," When his time of service was over, he went to his home. ","Tavraasii anikami, uqautiyumiñaiñŋagai iñuich. Tavrani iḷitchuġiŋarut tautuktilaaŋanik qiñiqtuuraamik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi. Tavra urriqaŋagai argagmiñik uqallaiŋavluni."
2073," After some time his wife Elizabeth became pregnant, and for five months she kept herself in seclusion. She said, ","Tavra Abijah-m piqatiŋisa savagviksraŋat naannamiuŋ aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, Zechariah aiŋaruq. "
2074," “This is what the Lord has done for me at the time when he has been gracious to me, to take away my disgrace among people.”","Tamatkua pianiŋmata, Zechariah-m nuliaŋa Elizabeth siŋaiyauŋaruq, aasii tallimani tatqiñi aimmiŋaruq isumalaaqłuni, "
2075," In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town of Galilee called Nazareth, ",Ataniq savaŋaruq aliuġnaqtuamik uvamnun. Paŋmapak kanŋusukkumiñaiqsuŋa miqłiqtuiññiġa pisigilugu.
2076," to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, a descendant of David, and the virgin’s name was Mary. ","Tavra itchaksrat tatqich pianiŋmata Elizabeth siŋaiyausaaniŋman, isaġulik Gabriel tiliŋagaa God-im iniqpaŋmun atiqaqtuamun Nazareth-mik, Galilee-miittuamun. "
2077," The angel came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one, the Lord is with you!” ","God-im tiliŋagaa niviaqsiamun aŋusiuŋaitchuamun atiqaqtuamun Mary-mik, piksrautiniŋaruamun aŋunmik atiqaqtuamik Joseph-mik, kiŋunġuruaq umialiŋmun David-mun. "
2078, But she was greatly troubled by his words and began to wonder about the meaning of this greeting. ,"[Tavra Gabriel-gum ullaŋagaa aasii uqallautivlugu, Tutqiutiqaġiñ, iviġaumagiraupiaqtuatiin, Atanġum itqatigigaatin. Quviatchaktitaurutin naamaruamik aġnapayaaniñ.] "
2079," So the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God! ","Tavra Mary-m atqunaqłuni tupauttaġiŋagaa uqalua isaġulgum, suli isumalaaġutigivlugu sumik paġlatiŋi sivuniqaġniaqtilaaŋannik. "
2080," Listen: You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus. ","Tavra isaġulgum uqallautiŋagaa, Iqsiñak Mary. God-im iviġaummatigigaatin. "
2081," He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David. ",Uvvaasii siŋaiyauniaqtutin aasii iġñiqaġlutin. Atchiġumagiñ Jesus-mik. 
2082," He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end.” ",Ilaa kamanaġniaqtuq. Iġñiġiniaġaa sapiġñaġniqsrauruam God-im. Suli Atanġum God-im umialiguqtinniaġaa David-tun maŋŋuuruatun ilaanun. 
2083," Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?” ","Aasii ilaa umialguniaqtuq isuitchuamun kiŋuniŋiñun Jacob, aasiisuli ilaan atanniqsimmataa isuiññiaqtuq."
2084," The angel replied, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called the Son of God.","Mary-m uqallautiŋagaa isaġulik, Qanuġluni taamna piyumiñaqpa uigiḷḷaġma? "
2085," “And look, your relative Elizabeth has also become pregnant with a son in her old age – although she was called barren, she is now in her sixth month! ","Tavra isaġulgum kiuŋagaa, Ilitqusiġiksuaq qaiñiaqtuq iliŋnun, aasii suaŋŋataata sapiġñaqtuam God-im itqatiginiaġaatin nalautillasiḷugu.

2087," So Mary said, “Yes, I am a servant of the Lord; let this happen to me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.",Qanuq God piḷḷaruq supayaamik.
2088," In those days Mary got up and went hurriedly into the hill country, to a town of Judah, ","Tavra Mary uqallaŋaruq, Uvva Atanġum kivgaġigaaŋa. Piḷi uvamnun tuvraġlugu uqaluiñ. Tavra isaġulik aullaŋaruq ilaaniñ."
2089, and entered Zechariah’s house and greeted Elizabeth. ,"Taavruma aquagun, Mary aullaġnasuaŋaruq qimialuuruamun nunamun, nunaaqqich iḷaŋannun Judea-miittuamun. "
2090," When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. ","Aasii isiŋaruq igluanun Zechariah-m, paġlavlugu Elizabeth. "
2091," She exclaimed with a loud voice, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child in your womb! ","Tavrali Elizabeth tusaakamiuŋ paġlataa Mary-m, miqłiqtuq aulaliqtuŋaruq iḷuani, suli Elizabeth Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalałługu, "

2093," For the instant the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. ",Qanutun iviġaumakkusiaqaqtigivik aakaŋata Ataniġma ullakkumiñaġmaŋa. 
2094, And blessed is she who believed that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled.”,"Qanuq uvva, paġlatin tusaapqauraqapku, miqłiqtuuraq iḷumni aulaliqtuŋaruq quviatchaktuatun. "

2096,"“My soul exalts the Lord, ","Tavra Mary uqallaŋaruq, Uummatimniñ iluqaaniñ nanġaġiga Ataniq, "
2097," and my spirit has begun to rejoice in God my Savior, ",suli iḷumni quviasukpaktuŋa qanuq God-im annaurrigikkaġma

2101, from generation to generation he is merciful to those who fear him.,Ilaa savaŋaruq aliuġnaqtuanik. Kamanaiŋagai kamasaaqtuat taputivlugich sivunniuġutiŋich.

2103," He has brought down the mighty from their thrones, and has lifted up those of lowly position;","Tamatkua ikayuqtisiuqtuat piqaqtuksrauvlutiŋ pisuġuiqsitkai, aasiiḷi ikayuqtisiuŋitchuat pigiraksraġikkaġmikkun ilaan pisuŋitkai. "

2105," He has helped his servant Israel, remembering his mercy,","Tavra Mary-m nayuŋagaa Elizabeth miksraułługich tatqich piŋasut, aasii utiŋaruq aimaaġviŋmiñun."
2106," as he promised to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.” ","Tavra tikiutiŋagaa Elizabeth iġñiviksraŋanun, aasii iġñiqaŋaruq. "
2107, So Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then returned to her home.,"Tavra siḷalliŋisa nanmiñiŋisalu tusaaŋagaat Ataniq kamanaqtuamik nagliktuiñivḷugu Elizabeth-mun, aasii quviasukpaqatigiŋagaat."
2108," Now the time came for Elizabeth to have her baby, and she gave birth to a son. ","Tavra tallimat piŋasuanni uvlut, iliŋikta nalunaiñŋutchiqsitchaqtuŋagaak miqłiqtuq, aasii atchiġuŋagaluaġaat Zechariah-mik aapaŋatun. "
2109," Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her.","Tavra aakaŋa uqallaŋaruq, Taavrumiŋa atiqaġniaŋitchuq. Ilaan atiġiniaġaa John. "
2110," On the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they wanted to name him Zechariah after his father. ","Tavra ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Nalliat-unnii nanmiñiq iḷavich atiqaŋaitchuq taavrumiŋa atiġmik. "
2111," But his mother replied, “No! He must be named John.” ","Tavra iliŋich urriqaŋarut aapaŋanun, apiqsrivḷutiŋ sumik ilaanun atchiqummagaan nukatpiaġruk. "

2113," So they made signs to the baby’s father, inquiring what he wanted to name his son. ","Tavra tavraŋŋatchiaq Zechariah uqallasiŋaruq, aasii uqallakłuni, nanġaqługu God. "
2114," He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, “His name is John.” And they were all amazed. ",Tavra aliuġutchaŋarut iluqaġmiŋ siḷalliŋi. Suli tamatkua iluqaisa uqautigiŋagaich iluqaani qimialuŋiññi Judea-m nunaaqqiŋisa. 
2115," Immediately Zechariah’s mouth was opened and his tongue released, and he spoke, blessing God. ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ tusaaruat tamatkuniŋa piiguitkaaġiŋagaich, uqaurrutiŋarut avanmun, Qanutun aliuġnaqtiginiaqpa una miqłiqtuq. Qanuq nalunaiñŋaruq Ataniġmun itqatigitilaaŋa."
2116," All their neighbors were filled with fear, and throughout the entire hill country of Judea all these things were talked about. ",Tavra John-gum aapaŋa Zechariah Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalałługu uqaqtinŋagaa nanġautinik piyumaaqtuaniglu. 
2117," All who heard these things kept them in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be?” For the Lord’s hand was indeed with him.","Nanġaġlakput Ataniq God-iŋat Israel-guruat, qanuq ilaan ikayuġiaŋagai aasii annautivlugich iñuŋni. "
2118," Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied,","Akunġanniñ kiŋuniŋisa David, God piksraŋaruq Iñuŋmik suaŋŋatiqaqtuamik annautiyumiñaqłuta. "
2119," “Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, ","Taimaŋŋaqaŋa uqausiġmisun ilaan nanmiñiq uqaqtimigun, "

2130,"may serve him without fear, ",
2131, in holiness and righteousness before him for as long as we live.,
2132," And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High.",
2133,"For you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways,",
2134, to give his people knowledge of salvation through the forgiveness of their sins.,
2135, Because of our God’s tender mercy,
2136,the dawn will break upon us from on high,
2137," to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,",
2138,to guide our feet into the way of peace.” ,
2139," And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and he was in the wilderness until the day he was revealed to Israel.",
2140, Now in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire for taxes. ,Taipkunani uvluni Caesar Augustus pitquraliŋaruq nunam iñupayauraŋi atanniqsimakkani atchiitquvlugich. 
2141," This was the first registration, taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria. ",Taamna atchiiñiq piqqaaŋaruq Quirinius atanauraumman Syria-mi. 
2142, Everyone went to his own town to be registered. ,Tavra iñupayaat atchiiyaqtuaŋarut ilaisa nanmiñiq iniqpaŋmiŋñun.
2143," So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David. ","Tavraptauq Joseph aullaŋammiuq Galilee-miñ, iniqpaŋmiñ Nazareth-miñ, Judea-mun iniqpaŋanun David, atiqaqtuamun Bethlehem-mik, qanuq ilaa David-gum kiŋuniġivlugu. "
2144," He went to be registered with Mary, who was promised in marriage to him, and who was expecting a child. ","Joseph atchiiyyaqatigiŋagaa Mary, tuvaaqatiksrautini, siŋaiyauruaq. "
2145," While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. ","Tavra tavraniillaġmiŋ, iġñiviksraŋan tikiutiŋagaa. "
2146," And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.","Tavra iġñiŋaruq aŋayukłiġmik aŋunmik aasii nimmaaŋagaa miquŋaitchuanik ukił̣haanik, aasii iḷivḷugu niġrutit niġġiviannun, qanuq iniksraiñŋarut tukkumaviŋmi."
2147," Now there were shepherds nearby living out in the field, keeping guard over their flock at night. ",Tavra tamaani nunami imnaiḷiqirit qaunaksriŋarut imnaimiŋnik unnuami. 
2148," An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were absolutely terrified. ","Tavra Atanġum isaġulgata niptaġvigiŋagai, suli qaumanġa Atanġum qaummaġiksinŋaruq avataannun, aasii iqsiḷiŋarut. "
2149," But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid! Listen carefully, for I proclaim to you good news that brings great joy to all the people: ","Tavra isaġulgum uqallautiŋagai, Iqsiñasi, qanuq uvva, quliaqtuaġutiyaqtuġivsi tusaayugaaġiksuanik iñupayaat quviasuutiqpaginiakkaŋiññik. "
2150, Today your Savior is born in the city of David. He is Christ the Lord. ,"Qanuq uumani unnuami aniruq annaurriksi, iniqpaŋani David, Christ-guruaq Ataniq. "
2151, This will be a sign for you: You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.” ,"Aasiuvva iḷitchuqqutiksraqsi ilaagutilaaŋanik. Ilivsi paqinniaġiksi miqłiqtuuraq nimmaaŋaruaq miquŋaitchuanik ukił̣haanik, suli nalavluni niġrutit niġġivianni."
2152," Suddenly a vast, heavenly army appeared with the angel, praising God and saying, ","Tavra tavraŋŋatchiaq isaġulik piqasiŋagaat isaġulisalaich nanġaqługu God, suli uqaqłutiŋ, "
2153," “Glory to God in the highest, ","Nanġaqtauli God qiḷaŋmiittuaq, suli nunami aŋuyautairrutiqaġli akunġanni iñuich ilaan iviġaumagikkaŋisa."
2154,and on earth peace among people with whom he is pleased!”,"Isaġulgich qiḷaŋmuaniŋmata, imnaiḷiqirit uqaŋarut inmiŋnun, Aullaqtauvagut Bethlehem-mun tautugiaġlugu taamamna piruaq, Atanġum kilgutigikkaŋa uvaptiŋnun. "
2155," When the angels left them and went back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go over to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, that the Lord has made known to us.” ","Tavra qilamiqsruqłutiŋ aullaŋarut, aasii paqiłługich Mary-ḷu Joseph-lu miqłiqtuuraġlu nalaruaq niġrutit niġġivianni.

2157," When they saw him, they related what they had been told about this child, ",Aasii iluqaġmiŋ iñuich tusaaruat imnaiḷiqiriniñ uqaluusiamiŋnik aliuŋarut. 
2158, and all who heard it were astonished at what the shepherds said. ,Mary-vḷiasii itqaumagiŋagai isumalaaġutigivlugich iluqaisa piruat. 
2159," But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering in her heart what they might mean. ","Tavra imnaiḷiqirit utiŋarut, kamanaqsiḷiqługu nanġaqługulu God iluqaisigun tusaaramikkun tautukkamikkullu uqausiusiamiktun."
2160," So the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen; everything was just as they had been told.","Tavra tallimat piŋasut uvlut naanmata, nalunaiñŋutchiqsauganiŋman, atchiqsauŋaruq Jesus-mik, atchiutiksrirrutaanik isaġulgum siŋaiyaagusaŋaiñŋaan."
2161," At the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.","Nalautinman Mary-vḷu Jesus-lu aullaġviksraŋak aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun nalautitchiyaqtuġlutiŋ Moses pitquraŋiñik miqłiqtuq animman, Jerusalem-muŋarut aitchuutigiyaqtuqługu miqłiqtuqtiŋ Ataniġmun. "
2162," Now when the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary brought Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord ","Taavrumuuna aglausimaruq God-im pitquraŋiñi inna, “Aŋugaiyaaq aŋayukłiq ilaaguaqtauniaqtuq Ataniġmun.” "
2163," (just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male will be set apart to the Lord”), ","Tavra tikiññamiŋ aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, aitchuiŋaruk ikipkautinik, Atanġum pitquraŋisa uqaluatigun, “Malġugnik nuyuaqturuagnik tiŋmiaŋnik, naagga malġugnik tiŋmiayaaŋnik nuyuitchuaŋnik.”"
2164," and to offer a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord, a pair of doves or two young pigeons.","Tavra iñuk inŋaruq Jerusalem-mi atiqaqtuaq Simeon-mik.

2165," Now there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon who was righteous and devout, looking for the restoration of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him. ",Ilitqusiġiksuam iḷitchuġipkaŋagaa tuquniaŋiññivḷugu tautukkaluaġnagu Annaurri Atanġum tiliñiakkaŋa. 
2166, It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die before he had seen the Lord’s Christ. ,"Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuam isummiŋagaa aŋaiyyuviŋmuguliqsiłługu. Tavraasii aŋayuqaaguruak itqutimmatku miqłiqtuq Jesus, pisisaqtuqługu piḷġusiatigun pitqurat, "
2167," So Simeon, directed by the Spirit, came into the temple courts, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him what was customary according to the law, ",Simeon tigumirriutiŋagaa aasii nanġaaqsivḷugu God uqaqłuni. 
2168," Simeon took him in his arms and blessed God, saying,","Ataniiq, paŋmapak uvaŋa kivgan tuquyumiñaqsiruŋa tutqigḷuŋa, qanuq taŋŋiŋagiñ unniqsuqłiisin uvamnun. "
2169," “Now, according to your word, Sovereign Lord, permit your servant to depart in peace.","Qanuq uvamnik tautuanikkiga Annaurri, "

2175, So the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was said about him. ,"Tavraptauq aġnaq atiqaqtuaq Anna-mik inmiñiqsuq, uqaqtaa God-im pania Phanuel-gum maŋŋuqaqtuam Asher-mik. Anna aaquaŋaniqsuq, tuvaaqatiqaŋaniqsuaq tallimat malġugni ukiuni, aasii uiŋa tuquvluni. "
2176," Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “Listen carefully: This child is destined to be the cause of the falling and rising of many in Israel and to be a sign that will be rejected.

2178," There was also a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having been married to her husband for seven years until his death. ","Tavra taŋŋianikamitkik supayaurat pitquraŋiguaqtuat Atanġum, utiŋarut Galilee-mun, aimaaġviŋmiŋnun Nazareth-mun. "

2180," At that moment, she came up to them and began to give thanks to God and to speak about the child to all who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.",Tavra Jesus aŋayuqaak aullaġaqtuk Jerusalem-mun ukiutuaġman niqinaqiviani Qulaurrusiqutikun Itqautim.

2182," And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.","Tavra niqinaqivik isukłiñman, utiqsaġmaŋnik nukatpiaġruk Jesus qimaktinŋaruq Jerusalem-mun. Aŋayuqaak aasii naluŋaruk. "
2183, Now Jesus’ parents went to Jerusalem every year for the feast of the Passover. ,"Tavra isummatigivlugu iglaani iglauqataunasugivlugu, iglauŋaruk uvluqtutilaaŋatun, aasii ivaŋagaluaġaak nanmiñiġmiŋni aunniuġusimakkamiŋniḷu. "
2184," When he was twelve years old, they went up according to custom. ","Tavraasii paqinŋisanikamitku, utiqsaŋaruk Jerusalem-mun ivaqługu. "
2185," But when the feast was over, as they were returning home, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents did not know it, ","Uvlut piŋasut pianiŋmata paqinŋagaak aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, aquppiruaq akunġanni iḷisaurrit pitquranik, naalaġnivḷugich apiqsruqtuqługiḷḷu. "
2186, but (because they assumed that he was in their group of travelers) they went a day’s journey. Then they began to look for him among their relatives and acquaintances. ,Tavra iluqaġmiŋ tusaaruat ilaanik kamasuŋarut kaŋiqsisuġniŋanik kiggutiŋiñiglu. 
2187," When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to look for him. ","Tavra aŋayuqaakisa tautukamitku, niġiiḷḷaqtauŋaruk. Aasii aakaŋata uqallautiŋagaa, Iġñiiŋ, summan inna piŋiksraqtitpisiguk? Uvva, aapallu uvaŋalu ivaŋagiptigiñ uŋiarrisigivlutin. "
2188," After three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagik, Qanuq imña ivaġniqpisiñŋa? Puttuqsriŋayumiñaŋagaluaqtutik ittuksrautilaamnik Aapama igluani. "
2189, And all who heard Jesus were astonished at his understanding and his answers. ,Tavra kaŋiqsiŋaitkaak ilaan uqallautaa inmiŋnun.
2190," When his parents saw him, they were overwhelmed. His mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been looking for you anxiously.” ","Tavra Jesus utiqatigiŋagik Nazareth-mun. Suli kamakkutiqaŋaruq iliŋiŋnun, aasiiḷi aakaŋan tamatkua iluqaisa itqagiŋagai. "
2191," But he replied, “Why were you looking for me? Didn’t you know that I must be in my Father’s house?” ","Tavra Jesus isumatusisaiññaŋaruq aglivḷuniḷu, suli iñuuŋaruq nalaunŋaruakun iviġaumavlugu God iñuiḷḷu."
2192, Yet his parents did not understand the remark he made to them. ,
2193," Then he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them. But his mother kept all these things in her heart. ",
2194," And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in favor with God and with people. ",
2195," In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene, ","Tavra una piŋaruq akimiaŋanni ukiut umialguniŋani Tiberius Caesar-m, Pontius Pilate kavanaupkaqługu Judea-mi, aasiiḷi Herod atanauraumman Galilee-mi, ilaan aniqataa Philip atanauraumman nunaŋiññun Ituraea-m Trachonitis-lu, suli Lysanias atanauraumman Abilene-mi. "
2196," during the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness. ","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaummaŋnigli Annas-lu Caiaphas-lu. Taavrumani ukiumi, God-im uqaluksriñŋagaa John, iġñiŋa Zecharias-gum, nunagluktuamiitillugu. "
2197," He went into all the region around the Jordan River, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.","Tavra John kukiḷuŋaruq iluqaiññun nunanun avataani kuuŋan Jordan ittuanun, alġaqsruivḷuni iñuich paptaiqsautquvlugich, isumalitqiqqaaġlutiŋ piḷuunmiŋniñ, God-mun suliqutigiŋaiqulugich itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich piḷuutitiŋ.

2198," As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, ","Taamna sivuniġivlugu aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna. Isaiah uqallaŋaruq,"

2207," So John said to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “You offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? ","Tavra iñuich niġiuktuaguvlutiŋ Christ-mik qaiyumaaqtuamik, iluqaġmiŋ nalupqisuutiqaŋarut John-kun, iḷaanni Christ-gunasugalugu. "
2208," Therefore produce fruit that proves your repentance, and don’t begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell you that God can raise up children for Abraham from these stones!

2209," Even now the ax is laid at the root of the trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” ","Ilaa arrilisauniaqtuq iñuŋmun ilaaguaqsiruamun palauvaksranik amiġaŋiññiñ.

2210," So the crowds were asking him, “What then should we do?” ","Tavra iñugiaktuanik allaniglu siḷġiqsuutinik, John alġaqsruiŋaruq tusaayugaaġiksuanik iñuŋnun. "
2211," John answered them, “The person who has two tunics must share with the person who has none, and the person who has food must do likewise.” ","Tavra John uqautigiŋagaa naġġuksruqługu atanauraq Herod pisigivlugu tuvaaqasiutimmagu Herodias aniqanmi tuvaaqataa, suli sutigun allatigun iluqaisigun pigiitchuatigun Herod piraŋigun.

2212," Tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?” ","Aasii Herod piŋaruq pigiił̣hamaaqtuamiksuli, John tigutaaqtiłługu."

2215," While the people were filled with anticipation and they all wondered whether perhaps John could be the Christ, ","Jesus isagutimmagu savaani iḷisaurriñiq ukiuqtutilaaqaqpalliŋaruq iñuiññaq qulitun. Iñuich isummatigiŋagaat Joseph-mun iġñiġivlugu. Joseph iġñiġigaa Heli-m, "
2216," John answered them all, “I baptize you with water, but one more powerful than I am is coming – I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. ","Heli-ḷi iġñiġigaa Matthat-gum, Matthat-li iġñiġigaa Levi-m, Levi-ḷi iġñiġigaa Melchi-m, Melchi-ḷi iġñiġigaa Jannai-m, Jannai-ḷi iġñiġigaa Joseph-gum, "

2218," And in this way, with many other exhortations, John proclaimed good news to the people. ","Naggai-ḷi iġñiġigaa Maath-gum, Maath-li iġñiġigaa Mattathias-gum, Mattathias-li iġñiġigaa Semein-gum, Semein-li iġñiġigaa Josech-gum, Josech-li iġñiġigaa Joda-m, "
2219," But when John rebuked Herod the tetrarch because of Herodias, his brother’s wife, and because of all the evil deeds that he had done, ","Joda-li iġñiġigaa Joanan-gum, Joanan-li Rhesa-m, Rhesa-li iġñiġigaa Zerubabbel-gum, Zerubabbel-li iġñiġigaa Shealtiel-gum, Shealtiel-li iġñiġigaa Neri-m, "
2220, Herod added this to them all: He locked up John in prison.,"Neri-ḷi iġñiġigaa Melchi-m, Melchi-ḷi iġñiġigaa Addi-m, Addi-ḷi iġñiġigaa Cosam, Cosam-li iġñiġigaa Elmadam, Elmadam-li iġñiġigaa Er-gum, "
2221," Now when all the people were baptized, Jesus also was baptized. And while he was praying, the heavens opened, ","Er-li iġñiġigaa Joshua-m, Joshua-li iġñiġigaa Eliezer-m, Eliezer-li iġñiġigaa Jorim, Jorim-li iġñiġigaa Matthat, Matthat-li iġñiġigaa Levi-m, "

2271," They got up, forced him out of the town, and brought him to the brow of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff. ","Tavra Jesus suaŋagaa uqallautivlugu, Nipaisaaġiñ. Anniiñ ilaaniñ. Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uum ulġutqaaqługu sivuġaanun Jesus, aniŋaruq ilaaniñ anniġaluaġnagu. "
2272, But he passed through the crowd and went on his way.,"Tavra iluqaġmiŋ aliuŋarut aasii avanmun uqaagaqsivḷutiŋ, Sunauna uqallaun? Qanuq sumiñ ataniġnaqutiqaqłuni suaŋŋatiqaqłuniḷu piraksriḷḷagai ilitqusiqł̣uich, aasii ilaisa kamagillavlugu. "
2273," So he went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and on the Sabbath he began to teach the people. ",Tavra uqaluk ilaagun siaminŋaruq inipayaanun tamatkunani nunani.
2274," They were amazed at his teaching, because he spoke with authority.","Tavra Jesus anivḷuni aŋaiyyuviŋmiñ Simon aimaaġvianuŋaruq. Tavra Simon aakaruaŋa naŋinŋaruq uunnautiqpaqaqłuni, aasii ilaisa ikayuqtaiḷiqutiŋagaat ilaanun. "
2275," Now in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice, ","Tavra Jesus makitchaqtuŋaruq siñigviŋisa saniġaannun, aasii suakługu uunnautaa, aasii uunnautaiŋaruq. Tavrauvvaa makiłłuni niqłiuġutirraqsiŋagai."
2276," “Ha! Leave us alone, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are – the Holy One of God.” ","Tavra siqiñiq nipisaġataaqsimman, iluqaġmiŋ tamatkua naŋittuaqaqtuat qanusiḷimaanik naŋirrutinik qaġġisiŋagaich Jesus-mun. Tavra ilaan aksiuŋagai iluqaisa aasii iłuaqsivḷugich. "
2277," But Jesus rebuked him: “Silence! Come out of him!” Then, after the demon threw the man down in their midst, he came out of him without hurting him. ","Suli ilitqusiqł̣uich unnii animmiraqtut iñugiaktuaniñ iñuŋniñ nipaalavlutiŋ, Ilivich Iġñiġigaatin God-im.

2278," They were all amazed and began to say to one another, “What’s happening here? For with authority and power he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out!” ","Tavra uvlaaġmagu Jesus aullaŋaruq aasii iñuił̣aamukłuni. Tavra iñuich ivaŋagaat. Aasii paqinnamirruŋ, qimaktaiḷiŋarut ilaanun. "
2279, So the news about him spread into all areas of the region.,"Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Alġaqsruiruksrauruŋa tusaayugaaġiksuanik atanniqsimmataata God-im, allanullu iniqpaŋnun, qanuq God-im tiliŋagaaŋa taamna savaaġitquvlugu. "
2280," After Jesus left the synagogue, he entered Simon’s house. Now Simon’s mother-in-law was suffering from a high fever, and they asked Jesus to help her. ",Tavra ilaa alġaqsruiŋaruq aŋaiyyuviŋiññi Judea-m.
2281," So he stood over her, commanded the fever, and it left her. Immediately she got up and began to serve them. ",
2282," As the sun was setting, all those who had any relatives sick with various diseases brought them to Jesus. He placed his hands on every one of them and healed them. ",
2283," Demons also came out of many, crying out, “You are the Son of God!” But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.",
2284," The next morning Jesus departed and went to a deserted place. Yet the crowds were seeking him, and they came to him and tried to keep him from leaving them. ",
2285," But Jesus said to them, “I must proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns too, for that is what I was sent to do.” ",
2286, So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Judea.,
2287," Now Jesus was standing by the Lake of Gennesaret, and the crowd was pressing around him to hear the word of God. ",Tavra Jesus makitaŋaruq siñaani tasiata Gennesaret. Tavrani iñuich katilġataviŋarut naalagumavlutiŋ uqaluanik God-im. 
2288," He saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets. ",Tavra Jesus tautuŋagik malġuk umiaqpaurak amummiruak. Iqaluŋniaqtit qimakkaŋich salummaivḷutiŋ kuvranik. 
2289," He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the shore. Then Jesus sat down and taught the crowds from the boat. ","Ikivluni igḷuanun umiaqpauram Simon pigikkaŋanun, Jesus apiġiŋagaa kaimitaallaquvlugu nunamiñ. Aasii ilaa aquptaaqłuni iḷisautirraqsiŋagai iñuich umiaqpauramiñ."
2290," When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and lower your nets for a catch.” ","Tavra Jesus uqaŋaiqami, uqallautiŋagaa Simon, Saavittitchi itiruamun aasii niŋillugich kuvraŋi qaaksaġlusi. "
2291," Simon answered, “Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing! But at your word I will lower the nets.” ","Tavra Simon-gum kiuŋagaa, Iḷisaurrii iqaluŋniallakkaluaqtugut tavra unnuaqtutilaaŋatun aŋiiññallaktugut. Aglaan uqallautin pisigilugu kuvriġñiaqtuŋa. "
2292," When they had done this, they caught so many fish that their nets started to tear. ","Tavra kuvrianikamiŋ, qaaŋagaich iqalusalaich, aasii kuvraŋich aligaġnialaŋarut. "
2293," So they motioned to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both boats, so that they were about to sink. ","Nuluġaŋagaich alġaisiŋ igḷuani umiaqpauramiittuat qaiḷugich ikayuġiaquvlutiŋ. Aasii qaivḷutiŋ usiḷḷiŋagaik iluqaaktun umiaqpaurak, pukłipiaġataqługik. "
2294," But when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!” ","Tavra Simon Peter-m iḷitchuġikamiuŋ taamna, sitquŋaruq sivuġaanun Jesus aasii uqallakłuni, Aullaġiñ uvamniñ Ataniiq, qanuq uvaŋa piḷuktuaguruŋa iñuk. "
2295," For Peter and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that they had taken, ",Qanuq ilaalu taapkualu piqatini niġiiḷḷaqtauŋarut taapkunuuna iqaluktamikkun. 
2296," and so were James and John, Zebedee’s sons, who were Simon’s business partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid; from now on you will be catching people.” ","Taapkuagluami James-lu John-lu iġñiŋik Zebedee-m alġaiguruak Simon-mun. Tavra Jesus uqallautigaa Simon, Iqsiñak. Iqalugniaġusiqsun, tavraŋŋaaglaan iñunnagniaġniaqtutin. "
2297," So when they had brought their boats to shore, they left everything and followed him. ","Tavra amuanikamisigik umiaqpauratik, qimaŋagaat sunapayaaq aasii malikługu Jesus."
2298," While Jesus was in one of the towns, a man came to him who was covered with leprosy. When he saw Jesus, he bowed down with his face to the ground and begged him, “Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean.” ","Tavra Jesus itillugu iniqpaich iḷaŋanni, iñuk qaiŋaruq kiḷḷiġruaqtuqpaktuaq. Tautukamiuŋ Jesus sitquŋaruq sivuġaanun aasii apiġivlugu, Ataniiq, pisukkuvich mamititchumiñaġiŋma. "
2299," So he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean!” And immediately the leprosy left him. ","Tavra Jesus isaaqłuni aksiuŋagaa uqallakłuni, Piyummatiqaqtuŋa. Mamittin. Tavraŋŋatchiaq kiḷḷiġruaŋi maminŋarut. "
2300," Then he ordered the man to tell no one, but commanded him, “Go and show yourself to a priest, and bring the offering for your cleansing, as Moses commanded, as a testimony to them.” ","Tavra Jesus uqaullaapiaŋagaa quliaqtuaquŋił̣ł̣ugu kimulliqaa, aglaan uqallautivlugu, Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋmugiñ qanuqitilaaġiaġlutin, aasii aitchuiḷutin ikipkautinik Moses piraksriutiŋiñik, ukpiġnaqsisaaġlugu paŋmapak salumasisilaan. "
2301," But the news about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering together to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses. ","Tavra siamiłhaaqsiññaŋaruq uqaluk ilaagun, aasii iñugiapiaġataqtuat iñuich katinŋarut naalagiaqłutiŋ suli iłuaqsipkaġiaqłutiŋ naŋirrutimiŋniñ. "
2302, Yet Jesus himself frequently withdrew to the wilderness and prayed.,Tavra Jesus aullaġuuruq iñuił̣aamun aŋaiyyuyaqtuqłuni.
2303," Now on one of those days, while he was teaching, there were Pharisees and teachers of the law sitting nearby (who had come from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem), and the power of the Lord was with him to heal. ","Tavra tamatkua uvlut iḷaŋanni, Jesus iḷisaurripkaqtillugu, iḷaŋich Pharisees-lu iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik aquppiŋarut saniġaani, qaiŋaruat nunaaqqipayaaŋiñiñ Galilee-m Judea-vlu, Jerusalem-miḷḷu, tavra Atanġum God-im suaŋŋasiŋagaa Jesus iłuaqsiyumiñaqsivḷugich naŋittuat. "
2304," Just then some men showed up, carrying a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to bring him in and place him before Jesus. ","Tavraptauq iñuich iḷaŋich qaġġirriŋarut aulalaitchuamik nalaruamik ikuvġamiñi, aasii itqutisaġaluaŋagaat iglumun iḷisukługu sivuġaanun Jesus. "
2305," But since they found no way to carry him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on the stretcher through the roof tiles right in front of Jesus. ","Aasii itqutiyumiñaiññamirruŋ, iñuich tativlutiŋ, mayuŋarut iglum qaaŋanun, qiḷaŋa aasii aŋmaqqaaqługu niŋiłługu ikuvġaqtuummaan qitqannun iñuich sivuġaanun Jesus. "
2306," When Jesus saw their faith he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven.” ","Tavra Jesus puttuqsrikamiuŋ ukpiġutaat taapkua iñuich, ilaa uqallaŋaruq aulalaitchuamun, Iñuuk, piḷuutitin suliqutigiŋaiqsaurut itqaumayumiñaiqł̣ugich. "
2307," Then the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to think to themselves, “Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?” ","Tavra iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik Pharisees-lu apiqsruqtuutirraqsiŋarut avanmun, Kiñauna iñuk uqaqpa tainna God-itun? Kiñaliqaa suliqutigiŋaiqsiyumiñaitchuq itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich piḷuutinik aglaan God kisimi. "
2308," When Jesus perceived their hostile thoughts, he said to them, “Why are you raising objections within yourselves? ","Tavra Jesus puttuqsrikami tainna isumaniġmata, uqallautiŋagai, Summan isumavisi tamatkuniŋa? "
2309," Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Stand up and walk’? ","Nalliak siġḷiġnaił̣haaqpa uqallaktuni, Piḷuutitin suliqutigiŋaiqsaurut iliŋnun, naagga uqallaktuni, Makillutin pisuaġiñ? "
2310," But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins” – he said to the paralyzed man – “I tell you, stand up, take your stretcher and go home.” ","Ukpiġnaqsiḷiġniaġiga ilivsiññun Iġñiŋa iñuum ataniġnaqutiqaqtilaaŋanik nunami suliqutigiŋaiġumiñaqługich piḷuutit. Tavrani uqallautiŋagaa iñuk aulalaitchuaq, uqallautigikpiñ, makittin. Tigulugich ikuvġatin, aggiiñ. "
2311," Immediately he stood up before them, picked up the stretcher he had been lying on, and went home, glorifying God. ","Tavra tavrauvvaa ilaa makinŋaruq sivuġaanni, aasii tiguvlugich ikuvġani aiŋaruq nanġaqługu God. "
2312," Then astonishment seized them all, and they glorified God. They were filled with awe, saying, “We have seen incredible things today.” ","Tavra iñuich aliuġutchapiaŋarut kamatchakłutiŋ, nanġaŋagaat God uqaqłutiŋ, Qiñiŋarugut aliuġnaqtuanik sunik uvlupak."
2313," After this, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax booth. “Follow me,” he said to him. ","Taavruma aquagun Jesus aniŋaruq, aasii tautuŋagaa tax-iñik katitchiri atiqaqtuaq Levi-mik, aquppiñiqsuaq tax-iḷiqiviŋmi. Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Maliŋŋa. "
2314," And he got up and followed him, leaving everything behind.","Tavra Levi-m makiłłuni qimaŋagai supayaat, aasii malikługu Jesus. "
2315," Then Levi gave a great banquet in his house for Jesus, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others sitting at the table with them. ",Tavra Levi-m niqinaqusiuġutiqpaŋagaa Jesus iglumiñi. Aasii tavrani iñusalaich inŋarut tax-iñik katitchirit iḷaqaqłutiŋ allaniglu aquppiqatauruanik niġġiviŋñi piqatigivlugich. 
2316," But the Pharisees and their experts in the law complained to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” ","Tavra Pharisees iḷisaurriŋiḷḷu pitquranik uqamayuutiŋagaich Jesus iḷitchitquraŋi, Summan niġiqatiqaġuuvisi imiqatiqaqłusiḷu tax-iñik katitchirinik piḷuusiqiriniglu? "
2317," Jesus answered them, “Those who are well don’t need a physician, but those who are sick do. ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Surruitchuat taaktituaksraitchut, aglaan naŋittuat. "
2318," I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”","Qaiŋaitchuŋa ququaġiaġlugich nalaunŋaruat iñuich, aglaan piḷuusiqirit isumalitqiquvlugich."
2319," Then they said to him, “John’s disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees, but yours continue to eat and drink.” ","Tavra iñuich iḷaŋisa uqallautiŋagaat Jesus, John-gum iḷitchitquraŋi akulaitchuami niġiḷaitchuurut aŋaiyyuuqłutiŋ, tamatkualu iḷitchitquraŋich Pharisees, aasiiḷi ilivich iḷitchitquratin niġiugaqtut imiqłutiglu. "
2320," So Jesus said to them, “You cannot make the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them, can you? ","Tavrali Jesus kiuŋagai, Isummatigivisigik tuyuġmiat katirrusiqiruani niġiḷaitquvlugich sivisutilaaŋatun uiksrautim nayuutiniŋata iliŋiññun? Tainna piñiaŋitchut. "
2321," But those days are coming, and when the bridegroom is taken from them, at that time they will fast.” ","Aglaan uiksrautim aullaurrauviksraŋa tikitchumaaqtuq, aasii taimanigu niġiḷaitpaallugniaqtut."
2322," He also told them a parable: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, he will have torn the new, and the piece from the new will not match the old. ","Jesus uqautivsaaŋammigai uuktuunmik. Kiñaliqaa aliksiḷaitchuq iḷaviñiŋanik nutauruam annuġaam aasii iḷaaġutivlugu annuġaaluŋmun.

2323," And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will burst the skins and will be spilled, and the skins will be destroyed. ","Iñuum suli immiutilaitkaa nutauruaq wine puuġruanun, qanuq nutauruam wine-gum puvlagluni qaaġniaġaa puuġruaq, aasii wine maqiluni asiñun, aasiiḷi puut maqulutiŋ. "
2324, Instead new wine must be poured into new wineskins. ,Aglaan nutauruaq wine puugaksraupiaqtuq nutauruanik puunik. 
2325," No one after drinking old wine wants the new, for he says, ‘The old is good enough.’”","Suli iñuktun kipiġniuŋitchuatun imiġugluni nutauruamik wine-mik imianiŋavluni utuqqauruamik wine-mik, tainnatun iñuich uqaġuurut utuqqauruat piḷġutchich nakuułhaaġnivḷugich nutauruaniñ piḷġutchiñiñ."
2326," Jesus was going through the grain fields on a Sabbath, and his disciples picked some heads of wheat, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them. ","Jew-guruat savairvianni, Jesus-lu iḷitchitquraniḷu pisuallaġmiŋ palauvaksrat nautchiaqaġviatigun, ilaan iḷitchitquraŋisa nutchugaŋagaich nauganiktuat palauvaksrat, amiġaiyaqługich argaŋmiŋnik, aasii niġivḷugich. "
2327," But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is against the law on the Sabbath?” ","Tavrali iḷaŋich Pharisees uqallaŋarut, Summan uvva inna pivisi? Qanuq pitquŋisauruq taamna pitquraptiŋni savaiññiptigun. "
2328," Jesus answered them, “Haven’t you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry – ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Nalupqinaitchuamik taiguaŋarusi qanuq David piŋatilaaŋanik kaaksiuliqamiŋ piqatiniḷu. "
2329," how he entered the house of God, took and ate the sacred bread, which is not lawful for any to eat but the priests alone, and gave it to his companions?” ","Ilaa isiŋaruq God-im igluanun aasii punniksraqłuni ilaaguaqtauŋaruanik God-mun, niġitquŋisauruanik iñuŋnun aglaan aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun kisian.

2330," Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath.”","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Iġñiŋa iñuum ataniġnaqutiqałhaaqtuq pitquraniñ aŋalatchiruaniñ iñuŋnik savaiññiġmi."
2331," On another Sabbath, Jesus entered the synagogue and was teaching. Now a man was there whose right hand was withered. ","Allamisuli Jew-guruat savairvianni, Jesus isiġman aŋaiyyuviŋmun suli iḷisaurrivḷuni, iñuk tavraniinŋammiñiqsuq taliqpia argakisuuraq. "
2332," The experts in the law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, so that they could find a reason to accuse him. ","Tavra pitquranik iḷisaurriḷḷu Pharisees-lu naipiqtuŋagaat, iłuaqsiriñiaqtilaaŋanik savaitchuani, pasisukkaluaqługu. "
2333," But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand here.” So he rose and stood there. ","Tavra Jesus iḷisimaŋagai ilaisa isumaŋich, aasii uqallautiŋagaa iñuk argakisuurauniqsuaq, Qaiñ. Makittin uvuŋa. Tavra tavruŋa makinŋaruq. "
2334," Then Jesus said to them, “I ask you, is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai.

2335," After looking around at them all, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand was restored. ","Tavra ilaan qiñiġaallakkaluaqamigich iluqaisa kiutchiaġivluni, uqallautiŋagaa, Isaakkich argaktin. Tavra isaaŋaruq, aasii argaŋi iłuaqsirauŋarut. "
2336, But they were filled with mindless rage and began debating with one another what they would do to Jesus. ,"Tavra iḷisaurriḷḷu Pharisees-lu piavsapiaġataŋarut, aasii uqaagaqsivḷutiŋ avanmun qanuġukkaluaqługu Jesus."
2337," Now it was during this time that Jesus went out to the mountain to pray, and he spent all night in prayer to God. ","Taipkunani uvluni Jesus aullaŋaruq qimialuŋnun aŋaiyyuyaqtuqłuni, aasii unnuaqtutilaaŋatun ilaa aŋaiyyuuŋaruq God-mun. "
2338," When morning came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also named apostles: ","Tavraasii uvluġman, ilaan qaitquŋagai iḷitchitqurani, aasii piksraġvigivlugich qulit malġugnik, tairauruanik ilaan tiliraŋiñik. "

2341," Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor. ","Judas-lu iġñiŋa James, suli Judas Iscariot aitchuutiginniktuaq ilaanik."
2342," Then he came down with them and stood on a level place. And a large number of his disciples had gathered along with a vast multitude from all over Judea, from Jerusalem, and from the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon. They came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, ","Tavra Jesus atqaqatigiŋagai iḷitchitqurani qimialuŋmiñ, aasii makiłłuni qaiqsuami nunami piqatigivlugich iñusalaich iḷitchitquraliutiruat inmiñun.

2377," But the person who hears and does not put my words into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation. When the river burst against that house, it collapsed immediately, and was utterly destroyed!”",

2389," As he approached the town gate, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother (who was a widow), and a large crowd from the town was with her.

2395, John’s disciples informed him about all these things. So John called two of his disciples ,Iḷitchitquraŋisa John quliaqtuaġutiŋagaat tamatkuniŋa iluqaiññik.

2432," and Joanna the wife of Cuza (Herod’s household manager), Susanna, and many others who provided for them out of their own resources.","Joanna-lu, nuliaŋa Chuzam, Herod-gum suġautchiqiriŋata, Susanna-lu, iñugiaktuallu allat aġnat ikayuiruat Jesus-mik iḷitchitquraŋiñiglu ilaisa pimiŋniñ."
2433," While a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from one town after another, he spoke to them in a parable: ","Tavra iñugiapiaġataqtuat iñuich katinmata atautchimun suli iñuich sumiḷḷiqaa nunaaqqiñiñ ullautimmata inmiñun, Jesus uqaŋaruq uuktuusiqł̣uni."
2434," “A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell along the path and was trampled on, and the wild birds devoured it. ","Nunaliqiri aullaŋaruq kanġaqsruiyaqtuqłuni nautchiaksranik palauvaksraġuġniaqtuanik. Kanġaqsruimman nautchiaqaġviŋmun, iḷaŋich kataŋarut apqutinun, aasii iñuich tunmalugiŋagaich, tiŋmiaġruiḷḷu qaivḷutiŋ niġiŋagaich. "
2435," Other seed fell on rock, and when it came up, it withered because it had no moisture. ","Aasii iḷaŋich nautchiaksrat kataŋammiut uyaġauruanun nunamun, aasii naummata panaqłuŋagai, qanuq nuna paliumavluni. "
2436," Other seed fell among the thorns, and they grew up with it and choked it. ","Aasii iḷaŋich nautchiaksrat kataŋarut kakiḷḷaġnaqtuat nauruat akunġannun, aasii kakiḷḷaġnaqtuat nauqasiqł̣ugich nautchiaksrat nagguviksraiñŋagaich. "
2437," But other seed fell on good soil and grew, and it produced a hundred times as much grain.” As he said this, he called out, “The one who has ears to hear had better listen!”","Aasii iḷaŋich kataŋammiut nunagiksuamun aasii nauvlutiŋ palauvaksrat, naurivḷutiŋ tallimakipiatun atautchimiñ. Taamna uqausiġillaan nipatusivḷuni uqallaŋaruq, Siutiqaqtusi tusaggatiksraŋnik, naalaġnisiŋa."
2438, Then his disciples asked him what this parable meant. ,"Tavra iḷitchitqurami apiġimmanni qanuq taamna uuktuun sivuniqaġmagaan, "
2439," He said, “You have been given the opportunity to know the secrets of the kingdom of God, but for others they are in parables, so that although they see they may not see, and although they hear they may not understand.","Jesus kiuŋagai, God-im kaŋiqsipkaŋagaa ilivsiññun kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruaq sivuani atanniqsimmatini iñuŋnun, aglaalli allat iñuich tusaqsraġigaat uuktuutitigun, qiñiġaluaqłutiŋ iḷisaqsriḷaitquvlugich, suli naalaġnigaluaqłutiŋ, kaŋiqsiḷaitquvlugich."
2440, “Now the parable means this: The seed is the word of God. ,Uuktuun inna sivuniqaqtuq. Nautchiaksrat palauvaksraġuġniaqtuat God-im uqaluatun ittut. 
2441," Those along the path are the ones who have heard; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. ","Nautchiaksrat iḷaŋich kataŋmatun apqutinun, tainnatuttauq iñuich iḷaŋich tusaaruat uqaluanik God-im siqquqsimmiraqtut. Tuunġaum qaivḷuni, piiguipkaġai tusaakkaŋannik, ukpiġlutiŋ annaurrautquŋił̣ł̣ugich. "
2442," Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in a time of testing fall away. ","Allalli iñuich ittut nautchiaksratun kataktuatun uyaġauruamun nunamun. Tusaapqauraqamirruŋ uqaluk, quyyatigivlugu akuqtuġaat.

2443," As for the seed that fell among thorns, these are the ones who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and their fruit does not mature. ","Allalli iñuich ittut nautchiaksratun kataktuatun akunġannun kakiḷḷaġnat nauruat.

"
2444," But as for the seed that landed on good soil, these are the ones who, after hearing the word, cling to it with an honest and good heart, and bear fruit with steadfast endurance.","Aasiiḷi allat iñuich ittut nautchiaksratun kataktuatun nunagiksuamun. Iliŋisa tusaagaat uqaluk akuqtupiaġataqługu kamagivlugulu, aasii iñuusiŋich allaŋŋuqtauvlutiŋ."
2445," “No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand so that those who come in can see the light. ","Iñuum kialiqaa ikitanikkamiuŋ naniq matulaitkaa utkusiŋmik, naaggaunnii iḷiḷaitkaa ataannun siñigviich, aglaan iḷisuugaa naniqaġviŋmun, tamatkua isiqtuat tautuquvlugich qaummaġmik. "
2446," For nothing is hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing concealed that will not be made known and brought to light. ","Sunapayaaq matutuqtuaq paŋmapak sivunniqsauŋaruq salapqiġumaaqługu taimanigu, suli sunapayaaq iḷisimapkaqtauŋitchuaq paŋmapak sivunniqsauŋaruq iḷitchuġipkaqtauyumaaqługu iñupayaanun taimanigu."
2447," So listen carefully, for whoever has will be given more, but whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has will be taken from him.” ","Naalaġnimmaġiksaaqsiuŋ tusaakkaqsi.

2448," Now Jesus’ mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not get near him because of the crowd. ","Tavrani Jesus aakaŋallu aniqatiiŋisalu ullaŋagaat, aglaan tikiḷaiñŋagaat iñugiakpaił̣ł̣uni. "
2449," So he was told, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, wanting to see you.” ","Tavra iñuum uqallautiŋagaa, Aakavich aniqatiiviḷḷu qaŋma siḷami tautugukkaatin. "
2450," But he replied to them, “My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.”","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai iluqaisa, Tamatkua tusaaruat uqaluanik God-im kamagivlugulu aakaptun aniqatiiptullu ittut."
2451," One day Jesus got into a boat with his disciples and said to them, “Let’s go across to the other side of the lake.” So they set out, ","Uvlut iḷaŋanni Jesus ikiŋaruq umiaqpauramun piqatigivlugich iḷitchitqurani, aasii uqallautivlugich, Ikaaqta aŋmuŋatchianun tatchim. Tavra ayaksaaŋarut. "
2452," and as they sailed he fell asleep. Now a violent windstorm came down on the lake, and the boat started filling up with water, and they were in danger. ","Tavra tiŋinnaaġniallaġmiŋ Jesus siquŋaruq. Tavra anuqqaŋaruq tasiq, aasii iksruġaliqł̣ugu imiġmik umiaqpauraŋat, navianniuliŋarut. "
2453," They came and woke him, saying, “Master, Master, we are about to die!” So he got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves; they died down, and it was calm. ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat ullakługu Jesus itiqsaŋagaat uqaqłutiŋ, Iḷisaurrii, Iḷisaurrii, kiviaqsirugut. Tavra itiŋaruq aasii suakługu anuġi ulivrigaqtuallu qaiḷḷiġich, aasii anuġaiŋaruq quunniġuqłuniḷu. "
2454," Then he said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and amazed, saying to one another, “Who then is this? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!”","Jesus uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Ukpiġutaipiaqtusiimña. Tavra taluqsratchaŋarut, suli kamanniuqłutiŋ uqaurrutiŋarut avanmun, Uvvauna kiuva? Anuġivlu immavlu kamagillaniġaak."
2455," So they sailed over to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee. ","Tavrani tikiñŋarut nunaŋannun Gerasenes, akianiittuamun Galilee-m. "
2456," As Jesus stepped ashore, a certain man from the town met him who was possessed by demons. For a long time this man had worn no clothes and had not lived in a house, but among the tombs. ","Tavra Jesus niummiuġlu nunamun, iñuum ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuam paaŋagaa iniqpaŋmiitchuuŋaruam. Sivisuruamik annuġaiḷaġniqsuq, suli iñuuniaqtuaguŋił̣ł̣uni iglumi, aglaan akunġanni iḷuvviviich. "
2457," When he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and shouted with a loud voice, “Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! I beg you, do not torment me!” ","Tautukkamiuŋ Jesus, ilaa nipaalaŋaruq aasii punŋaruq sivuġaanun, uqallakłuni nipatutilaamisun, Jesus, Iġñiŋa sapiġñaġniqsrauruam God-im, suniaqpiŋa? Apiġipiaġikpiñ, tatavsaġnaŋa. "
2458," For Jesus had started commanding the evil spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, so he would be bound with chains and shackles and kept under guard. But he would break the restraints and be driven by the demon into deserted places.) ","Qanuq Jesus anitquaniŋagaa ilitqusiqł̣uk ilaaniñ. Iñugiaktuani ilitqusiqł̣uum piyugaġniġaa.

2459," Jesus then asked him, “What is your name?” He said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered him. ","Jesus tavrani apiġiŋagaa, Kiña atqiñ. Aasii ilaan kiuŋagaa, Uvaŋa atiġa Legion. Qanuq iñugiaktuat ilitqusiqł̣uich isiġmiuvigiŋagaat. "
2460, And they began to beg him not to order them to depart into the abyss. ,Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uich apiġipiaŋagaat Jesus tilitquŋił̣ł̣utiŋ nagliksaaġviŋmun.
2461," Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, and the demonic spirits begged Jesus to let them go into them. He gave them permission. ",Tavra tavrani iñugiaktuat tuttuqłuich niġiñiaŋarut maniñġani qimialuum. Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uich apiġipiaŋagaat Jesus isiqtitquvlutiŋ tuttuqłuŋnun. Tainnaasii pipkaŋagai. 
2462," So the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of pigs rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned. ","Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uich aniŋarut iñuŋmiñ aasii isiġvigivlugich tuttuqłuich. Tavraasii tuttuqłuich arviksuŋarut qutaitchuakun ikpikun tatchimun, aasii ipivlutiŋ."
2463," When the herdsmen saw what had happened, they ran off and spread the news in the town and countryside. ","Tavra qaunaksriruat tuttuqługnik tautukkamirruŋ taamna piruaq, pigruŋarut, aasii quliaqtuaġiaqsivḷugu iniqpaŋmi nunaaqqiñiḷu. "
2464," So the people went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus. They found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting at Jesus’ feet, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. ","Tavrani iñuich aullaaŋarut tautugiaqsaqłutiŋ suna pisilaaŋanik.

2465, Those who had seen it told them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed. ,Aasii iñuich tautuktuat taavrumiŋa quliaqtuaġutiŋagaich allat iñuich qanuq taamna ilitqusiqł̣uqaŋaruaq iłuaqsirautilaaŋanik. 
2466," Then all the people of the Gerasenes and the surrounding region asked Jesus to leave them alone, for they were seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and left. ","Tavrani iluqaġmiŋ iñuich avataanni nunaaqqiŋisa Gerasenes apiġiŋagaat Jesus aullaquvlugu, qanuq iliŋich iqsitchakpaŋarut. Tavraasii ilaa ikiŋaruq umiaqpauramun aasii aullaqłutiŋ. "
2467," The man from whom the demons had gone out begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away, saying, ","Iñuum taavruma ilitqusiqł̣uiqsauŋaruam qasiḷiŋagaluaġaa maligukługu, aasii Jesus aitqugiññaŋagaa uqallautivlugu, "
2468," “Return to your home, and declare what God has done for you.” So he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town what Jesus had done for him.","Utiġiñ aimaaġviŋñun, aasii quliaqtuaġlutin qanutun God-mun ikayuŋatilaaġnik. Tavra ilaa aullaŋaruq, quliaqtuaġivlugu iluqaani iniqpaŋmi qanutun Jesus-mun ikayuŋatilaani."
2469," Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him. ","Tavra Jesus utiġman taaguŋatchianun tatchim, iñusalaich paġlaŋagaat, qanuq iluqaġmiŋ utaqqiuŋagaat. "
2470," Then a man named Jairus, who was a ruler of the synagogue, came up. Falling at Jesus’ feet, he pleaded with him to come to his house, ","Tavra tavrani iñuk qaiŋaruq atiqaqtuaq Jairus-mik, umialiŋnauruaq aŋaiyyuviŋmun, aasii pułłuni Jesus sivuġaanun, apiġipiaŋagaa iglumiñuquvlugu. "
2471," because he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying.","Panisualuqaġniqsuaq, qulit malġugnik ukiuliŋmik, tuquaqsiruamik. Tavra Jesus aullaŋaruq aasii igliqtillugu, iñuich tatiŋarut avataanun."
2472,"As Jesus was on his way, the crowds pressed around him. ","Tavra aġnaq suniġluqaqtuaq auŋmik qulit malġugni ukiuni iłuaqsiḷaiññikkaŋat taaktit, "
2473, Now a woman was there who had been suffering from a hemorrhage for twelve years but could not be healed by anyone. ,"tunuŋiutiŋaruq ilaanun iñusalaŋni, aasii aksiukługu siñiġutaa annuġaaŋan, aasii aunaaqsruŋaiqł̣uni tavrauvvaa. "
2474," She came up behind Jesus and touched the edge of his cloak, and at once the bleeding stopped. ","Tavra Jesus apiqsriŋaruq, Kia aksiukpaŋa? Tavra iluqaġmiŋ piiḷaaġmata, Peter uqallaŋaruq, Iḷisaurrii, iñusalaich uvva avanŋagaatin suli tatimmiraġaatin. "
2475," Then Jesus asked, “Who was it who touched me?” When they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing against you!” ","Tavra Jesus uqallalgitchuq, Iñuum imma aksiŋagaaŋa qanuq iḷisimagiga suaŋŋan aullaqtuaq uvamniñ. "
2476," But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, for I know that power has gone out from me.” ","Tavrali aġnaq iḷitchuġikami ilaa iriqsimayumiñaisilaamiñik, qaiŋaruq uullaġruaqtun, aasii pułłuni sivuġaanun Jesus.

2477," When the woman saw that she could not escape notice, she came trembling and fell down before him. In the presence of all the people, she explained why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed. ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagaa, Aġnaaq, ukpiġurvich iłuaqsipkaġaatin. Aullaġiñ tutqiksiḷutin."
2478," Then he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace.” ","Jesus uqaġataviksillugusuli, kivgaŋa umialiŋnam igluaniñ qaiŋaruq aasii uqallakłuni, Paniiñ tuquruq. Iḷaksianagu Iḷisaurri. "
2479," While he was still speaking, someone from the synagogue ruler’s house came and said, “Your daughter is dead; do not trouble the teacher any longer.” ","Tavra Jesus tusaavlugu taamna uqallautiŋagaa Jairus, Ipiqtusugnak. Ukpiqsiññaġiñ iłuaqsiñiaqtuq. "
2480," But when Jesus heard this, he told him, “Do not be afraid; just believe, and she will be healed.” ","Tavra tikiññamiuŋ iglu, isiqasiqsinŋaitchuq iñuŋmun, aglaan Peter-lu John-lu James-lu, aapaŋalu aakaŋalu miqłiqtum. "
2481," Now when he came to the house, Jesus did not let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, and James, and the child’s father and mother. ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ iñuich qiaqpaŋarut, aasii Jesus uqallaŋaruq, qiaŋaiġitchi. Miqłiqtuq tuquŋaitchuq, siñiksiññaqtuq. "
2482," Now they were all wailing and mourning for her, but he said, “Stop your weeping; she is not dead but asleep.” ","Tavra ilaisa iglautigiŋagaat, iḷisimavlutiŋ miqłiqtum tuquŋatilaaŋanik. "
2483," And they began making fun of him, because they knew that she was dead. ","Tavra Jesus tiguvlugu argaŋigun ilaa uqallaŋaruq, “Miqłiqtuuq, makittin.” "
2484," But Jesus gently took her by the hand and said, “Child, get up.” ","Tavra miqłiqtuq iñuusatqiŋaruq, aasii makinŋaruq tavrauvvaa. Jesus piraksriŋagai sumik niġipkaquvlugu. "
2485," Her spirit returned, and she got up immediately. Then he told them to give her something to eat. ","Tavra ilaan aŋayuqaak aliuŋaruk, aasii Jesus piraksriŋagik uqaquŋił̣ł̣ugik kimulliqaa taavrumiŋa piruamik."
2486," Her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.",
2487," After Jesus called the twelve together, he gave them power and authority over all demons and to cure diseases, ","Tavra Jesus qaitquŋagai qulit malġuk iḷitchitqurani atautchimun, aasii aitchuqługich ataniġnaqunmik, suaŋŋasiqł̣ugich payariyumiñaqsivḷugich iluqaisa ilitqusiqł̣uich, suli iłuaqsiyumiñaqsivḷugich naŋirrutiqaqtuat.

2488, and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick. ,"Aasii ilaan tiliŋagai alġaqsruitquvlugich God-im atanniqsimmataanik iñuŋnun, suli iłuaqsiritquvlugich naŋittuanik. "
2489," He said to them, “Take nothing for your journey – no staff, no bag, no bread, no money, and do not take an extra tunic. ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Saagaġnasi supayaamik iglauniksravsiññun, ayauppiagiḷḷusi, puukataiḷḷusiḷu, taquagiḷaaġlusiḷu, maniiḷaaġlusiḷu, suli malġugnik qaliġuuraqaġnasi. "
2490," Whatever house you enter, stay there until you leave the area. ","Suli kisumulliqaa iglumun tukkuliqpasi, tavraniitchumausi, aullaġnivsiññunaglaan. "
2491," Wherever they do not receive you, as you leave that town, shake the dust off your feet as a testimony against them.” ","Suli sumipayaaq tukkuliŋitpasi, aullaġuvsi taavrumaŋŋa nunaaqqimiñ, ivsuktuġumagiksi avyuq isigavsiññiñ kiliksaġlugich killuliqitilaaŋannik. "
2492," Then they departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing people everywhere.","Tavra iḷitchitqurat aullaŋarut aasii iglauvlutiŋ nunaaqqisigun, alġaqsruivḷutiŋ tusaayugaaġiksuamik, iłuaqsirivḷutiglu naŋittuanik sumiḷiqaa."
2493," Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening, and he was thoroughly perplexed, because some people were saying that John had been raised from the dead, ","Tavra Herod Atanaurauruaq Galilee-mi, tusaakami iluqaiññik savaaguruanik, ilaa alapinŋaruq, pisigivlugu iñuich iḷaŋisa uqautigikkaŋat John Paptaiqsi aŋipkaqtaunivḷugu tuqqunmiñ, "

2495," Herod said, “I had John beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” So Herod wanted to learn about Jesus.","Herod uqallaŋaruq, John niaquiŋagiga, aasiuvva kiuva taimña iñuk tusaqsraġikkaġa uqautigikkaŋat? Tavra ilaan kasuġumaŋagaluaġaa Jesus."
2496," When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them with him and they withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida. ","Tavra tilirauŋaruat iḷitchitqurat utiqamiŋ, quliaqtuaġutiŋagaat Jesus savaamikkun. Tavra ilaan piqasiutiŋagai aasii aullautivlugich iñuił̣aamun qaniŋanun nunaaqqim Bethsaida-m. "
2497," But when the crowds found out, they followed him. He welcomed them, spoke to them about the kingdom of God, and cured those who needed healing. ","Iñusalaich iḷitchuġikamirruŋ Jesus maliŋagaat. Aasiivsauq ilaan paġlaŋagai suli uqautivlugich God-im atanniqsimmataanik iñuŋnun, iłuaqsivḷugiḷḷu tamatkua iłuaqsiraksrauruat."
2498," Now the day began to draw to a close, so the twelve came and said to Jesus, “Send the crowd away, so they can go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and food, because we are in an isolated place.” ","Tavra siqiñiq nipiaqsimman, qulit malġuk iḷitchitqurat ullakługu uqallautiŋagaat Jesus, Aullaqtitkich iñusalaich, aullaqulugich nunaaqqiñun sumulliqaa, siñiktaġviksranun taquaksraġviksranullu.

2499," But he said to them, “You give them something to eat.” They replied, “We have no more than five loaves and two fish – unless we go and buy food for all these people.” ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Ilivsi niqiksritchigik.

2500," (Now about five thousand men were there.) Then he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.” ","Iñugiaktilaaqaqpalliŋarut 5,000-tun aŋutit. Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Aquvititchigik iñuich malġukipiaq quligullaalugich atautchiich. "
2501," So they did as Jesus directed, and the people all sat down. ",Tavra aquvitinŋagaich iluqaisa. 
2502," Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven he gave thanks and broke them. He gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd. ","Tavra tiguvlugich tallimat punniġich malġuglu iqalluk, Jesus qiviaŋaruq qiḷaŋmun, aasii quyyavigivlugu God.

2504," Once when Jesus was praying by himself, and his disciples were nearby, he asked them, “Who do the crowds say that I am?” ","Tavra uvlut iḷaŋanni Jesus kisimi aŋaiyyuŋaruq iḷitchitqurat saniġaanni.

2507," But he forcefully commanded them not to tell this to anyone, ",Tavra Jesus piraksriŋagai iḷitchitqurani quliaqtuaquŋipiallakługich taavrumiŋa kimulliqaa. 
2508," saying, “The Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and experts in the law, and be killed, and on the third day be raised.”","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Iġñiŋa iñuum nagliksaaqtuksrauruq atqunaq, suli umialiŋnallu aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik pisuŋiññiaġaat suli tuqutauluni. Aasii aŋipkaqtauniaqtuq uvluk piŋayuaŋni."
2509," Then he said to them all, “If anyone wants to become my follower, he must deny himself, take up his cross daily, and follow me. ","Kialiqaa maligukkumiŋa, piruksrauŋitchuq ilaan pisukkamiñik, iqsriutilugu aŋarraurani, itqanaitchuksrauruq tuqutautigiyumiñaġluŋa unnii. "
2510," For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it. ","Qanuq iñuk iñuullatuvaił̣aktuaq tammaiñiaqtuq iñuggunmiñik, aglaalli iñuk sullatuaġumiḷu atiruaq tuqqutiyumiñaġluŋaunnii, tammaiyumiñaipiaġaa iñuggutini. "
2511, For what does it benefit a person if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself? ,"Iñuk suġallakkaluaġumi supayauranik nunamiittuanik aasii tammautigilugich, ilaa suuramik-unnii anniqsuġumiñaitchuq inmiñik. Simmiutigimmatun iñuggutini pigaa. "
2512," For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels. ","Qanuġviitchuq, iñuum kanŋugikpaŋa iḷisaurrutitkalu iñuŋnun, uvaŋaptauq Iġñiŋan iñuum kanŋuginiaġmigiga qaiguma qaumanġani Aapama piqatigilugich piḷuutaitchuat isaġulgich. "
2513," But I tell you most certainly, there are some standing here who will not experience death before they see the kingdom of God.”","Uqallautigivsi iḷumun. Iñuqaqtuq iḷaŋiññik uvani makitaruanik, tuquŋaiñŋaġmiŋ tautugniaqtuanik God-im atanniqsimmataanik iñuŋnun."
2514," Now about eight days after these sayings, Jesus took with him Peter, John, and James, and went up the mountain to pray. ","Tavra tallimat piŋasut uvlut pianikpalliġmata aquatigun taapkua uqaluuruat, Jesus piqasiutiŋagai Peter-lu John-lu James-lu, aasii mayuqłutiŋ iġġimun aŋaiyyuyaqtuqłutiŋ. "
2515," As he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became very bright, a brilliant white. ","Tavra ilaa aŋaiyyupkaqtillugu, kiiñaŋa allaŋŋuŋaruq, suli annuġaaŋi qivliatitaliqł̣utiŋ qatiġruaqtun. "
2516," Then two men, Moses and Elijah, began talking with him. ",Tavrasuli malġuk iññuk uqaqatigirraqsiŋagaak Moses-lu Elijah-vlu. 
2517, They appeared in glorious splendor and spoke about his departure that he was about to carry out at Jerusalem. ,"Niptaŋaruk qaumaniqaqłutiŋ, aasii uqautigiaqsivḷugu tuqutauniksraŋa nalautinniakkaŋa Jerusalem-mi. "
2518," Now Peter and those with him were quite sleepy, but as they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men standing with him. ",Tavra Peter-lu iḷagikkaŋniḷu siñiŋarut. Itiqłutiŋ tautuŋagaat Jesus qaumanġa taapkuaglu iññuk malġuk makitaruak saniġaani. 
2519," Then as the men were starting to leave, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. Let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah” – not knowing what he was saying. ","Tavra iññuk aullaqsaġmagnik ilaaniñ, Peter uqallaŋaruq Jesus-mun, Iḷisaurrii, iłuaqtuq uvaniinnapta. Piŋasunik tupiqta, atautchimik iliŋnun, atautchimik Moses-mun, suli atautchimik Elijah-mun. Iḷisimaŋitchuq sumik uqaqtilaamiñik. "
2520," As he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered the cloud. ","Uqaqtillugu Peter taavrumiŋa, nuvuya qaiŋaruq aasii qulaŋiqł̣ugich. Tavra iqsitchaŋarut nuvuyamun maġġutisaġniallaġmik. "
2521," Then a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!” ","Tavra nivliŋaruq nuvuyamiñ uqallakłuni, Uvva Iġñiġa, uvaŋa Piksraqtaaġa. Naalaġnisiuŋ. "
2522," After the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. So they kept silent and told no one at that time anything of what they had seen.","Tavra nipi uqallaaniŋman, Jesus kisiŋŋuqtauŋaruq. Taipkunani uvluni iliŋich quliaqtuaqsaiḷiŋarut kisupayaamun supayaamik tautukkaġmiŋnik."
2523," Now on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him. ","Tavra uvlaakumman, atqaaniŋmata iġġimiñ, iñusalaich ullaŋagaat Jesus. "
2524," Then a man from the crowd cried out, “Teacher, I beg you to look at my son – he is my only child! ","Tavra iñuk akunġanniñ iñusalaich saqłaŋaruq, Iḷisaurrii, qiññuvigipiallakkikpiñ iłuaqsitquvlugu iġñiġa, qanuq iġñitualugigiga. "
2525," A spirit seizes him, and he suddenly screams; it throws him into convulsions and causes him to foam at the mouth. It hardly ever leaves him alone, torturing him severely. ","Ilitqusiqł̣uum aŋalattaġiaqsiraġigaa, aasii tavraŋŋatchiaq nipaallakłuni, qiiqsruaqsiraqtuq innuġrualiqiliġataqłuni, suli iqł̣ataġivlugu. Ilitqusiqł̣uum qimaummipialaitkaa. "
2526," I begged your disciples to cast it out, but they could not do so.” ","Qiññuaġvigiŋagaluaġitka iḷitchitquratin anitquvlugu ilitqusiqł̣uk, aasii anilaiñŋagaat. "
2527," Jesus answered, “You unbelieving and perverse generation! How much longer must I be with you and endure you? Bring your son here.” ",Jesus uqallaŋaruq. Qanutun ukpiġutaisigirusi killukuaqtigirusiḷu. Qanutun sivisutigiruamik nayuġniaqpisi igḷutuġlusiḷu? Qaġġitchuuŋ iġñiġiñ uvuŋa. 
2528," As the boy was approaching, the demon threw him to the ground and shook him with convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father. ","Qaisaġniaqtillugu, ilitqusiqł̣uum iqł̣ataġiŋagaa nukatpiaġruk qiiqsruqtiłługulu. Tavra Jesus suaŋagaa ilitqusiqł̣uk. Aasii iłuaqsikamiuŋ nukatpiaġruk, qaitqikł̣ugu aapaŋanun. "
2529, Then they were all astonished at the mighty power of God.,Tavra iluqaġmiŋ iñuich kamatchaŋarut God-im suaŋŋatiqpaŋanik.
2530,"But while the entire crowd was amazed at everything Jesus was doing, he said to his disciples, ","Tavrali iñuich iluqaġmiŋ kamasualapkaqługich supayaatigun piraigun, Jesus uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, "
2531," “Take these words to heart, for the Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of men.” ","ukua uqaluich piiguġnagich uqautigikkatka ilivsiññun, qanuq Iġñiŋa Iñuum aitchuutauniaqtuq iñuŋnun tuqutqulugu. "
2532," But they did not understand this statement; its meaning had been concealed from them, so that they could not grasp it. Yet they were afraid to ask him about this statement.","Iliŋisa kaŋiqsiŋaitkaat taamna uqallaun, suli kaŋiqsipkaqtitauŋaitchuq iliŋiññuñ, puttuqsriyumiñaiqł̣ugich taavrumiŋa, suli iliŋisa apiġisausiiñŋagaat taavrumuuna uqallautaagun."
2533, Now an argument started among the disciples as to which of them might be the greatest. ,Tavra uqavaarraqsiŋarut iḷitchitqurat nalliqsiŋ kamanałhaaġniaqtilaaŋagun. 
2534," But when Jesus discerned their innermost thoughts, he took a child, had him stand by his side, ","Tavra Jesus puttuqsrikamiuŋ isumaŋat kamanaġumaruaq, ilaan tiguŋagaa miqłiqtuq aasii saniqqamiñun inillakługu. "
2535," and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me, for the one who is least among you all is the one who is great.”","Aasii uqallautiŋagai, Kialiqaa paġlakpagu piaqłuktaŋiḷḷugu una miqłiqtuq uvaŋa pisigiluŋa, paġlagaaŋa uvaŋa.

2536," John answered, “Master, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him because he is not a disciple along with us.” ","John uqallaŋaruq, Iḷisaurrii, tautuŋarugut iñuŋmik anittairuamik ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik atuqługu atqiñ, aasii iñiqtikkaqput qanuq piqatigiŋitkaatigut. "
2537," But Jesus said to him, “Do not stop him, for whoever is not against you is for you.”","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Iñiqtiġnagu, qanuq akiḷḷiḷiqsuiŋitchuaq ilivsiññik iḷagigiksi."
2538," Now when the days drew near for him to be taken up, Jesus set out resolutely to go to Jerusalem. ","Tavra qallimman Jesus qiḷaŋmugviksrani, qapiŋaipiaŋaruq aullaġukłuni Jerusalem-mun. Aasii tilisiŋaruq kivganik sivumiñi. "
2539," He sent messengers on ahead of him. As they went along, they entered a Samaritan village to make things ready in advance for him, ","Taapkua aullaŋarut aasii tikił̣ł̣utiŋ nunaaqqiannun Samaria-ġmiut, itqanaiyautisukługu Jesus. "
2540," but the villagers refused to welcome him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem. ","Tavra iñuich tukkuliŋaitkaat Jesus, qanuq iḷitchuġivlutiŋ Jerusalem-muksaqtilaaŋanik. "
2541," Now when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?” ","Tavra James-lu John-lu iḷitchitqurak iḷitchuġikamitku taamna, uqallaŋaruk, Ataniiq, qiññuaquvisiguk igniġmik qiḷaŋmiñ aasii ikipkaġlugich Elijah-m piraŋatun. "
2542," But Jesus turned and rebuked them, ","Tavra Jesus qiviaqługik suaŋagik uqallautivlugik, [kaŋiqsiŋaitchutik qanuq piḷġusiksramik, "
2543, and they went on to another village.,qanuq Iġñiŋa iñuum qaiŋaitchuq suksraunġiġiaġlugich iñuich aglaan annautiyaqtuqługich.] Aasii iliŋich iglauŋarut allamun nunaaqqimun.

2545," Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and the birds in the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Pisukkaat sisiqaqtut, suli tiŋmiat ugluqaqtut, aglaan Iġñiŋa iñuum aimaaġviitchuq pimaaqtuġumiñakkamiñik. "
2546," Jesus said to another, “Follow me.” But he replied, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.” ","Allamulli Jesus uqallaŋammiuq, Maliŋŋa. Aasii iñuum kiuŋagaa, Ataniiq, iḷuviġiallaktiqqaaġlagu aapaga. "
2547," But Jesus said to him, “Let the dead bury their own dead, but as for you, go and proclaim the kingdom of God.” ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Tamatkua tuquŋaruatun ittuat iḷuvviuġlich tuquŋaruanik. Aglaalli ilivich, aullaġlutin quliaqtuaġiyaqtuġuŋ God-im atanniqsimmataa iñuŋnun. "
2548," Yet another said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to my family.” ","Allasuli iñuk uqallaŋaruq, Ataniiq uvaŋa maliġuaġniaġikpiñ, aglaan takuruġuiqsuaġiallaglagich iglumniittuat. "
2549," Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.”","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, kiñaliqaa saqutittuaq savaamiñ uvaŋa sivunniutigikkamniñ ilaanun, nalliummatiŋitchuq atanniqsimapkaġumiñaġluni God-mun."
2550, After this the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them on ahead of him two by two into every town and place where he himself was about to go. ,"Taavruma aquagun Ataniq piksraŋaruq 70 allanik iḷitchitquranik, aasii aullaqtiłługich sivumiñi malġuullaavlugich, nunaaqqipayaanun ilaan ullakkumakkamiñun. "
2551," He said to them, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few. Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest. ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Iñusalaich utaqqirut tusaayumavlutiŋ tusaayugaaġiksuanik, palauvaksratun nauganiktuatun kipisałhiñaaġuqługich, aglaan savaktit iñukitchut.

2552, Go! I am sending you out like lambs surrounded by wolves. ,"Aullaġitchi. Uvva, tiligivsi imnaiyaatun akunġannun amaqqut. "
2553," Do not carry a money bag, a traveler’s bag, or sandals, and greet no one on the road. ","Saagaġnasi maniqaġviŋñik, puukataniglu, aluġutiniglu, suli paġlannigḷusi iñaviqqutchiġñasi apqunmi. "
2554," Whenever you enter a house, first say, ‘May peace be on this house!’ ","Kisupayaaq iglu isiġvigiguvsiuŋ, uqallaqqaaġitchi inna, Tutqiutiqaġitchi. "
2555," And if a peace-loving person is there, your peace will remain on him, but if not, it will return to you. ","Tavraasii tutqiḷḷaturuaq iñuk tavraniitpan, tutqiun inniaqtuq. Aasii tutqiutiqallaturuamik iñuitpan, tutqiun inniaŋitchuq tavrani. "
2556," Stay in that same house, eating and drinking what they give you, for the worker deserves his pay. Do not move around from house to house. ","Nayuutiyumausi taavrumani iglumi, niġiḷusi sunik niqiksritpasi imiġlusiḷu, qanuq savakti nalliummatiruq akiḷiusiaksramiñun. Nuktaġnasi iglumiñ iglunun. "

2558," Heal the sick in that town and say to them, ‘The kingdom of God has come upon you!’ ","Iłuaqsiḷugich naŋittuat taavrumani nunaaqqimi, suli uqallautilugich, God-im atanniqsimmataata qallipiaġataġaasi. "
2559," But whenever you enter a town and the people do not welcome you, go into its streets and say, ","Aglaan qakugupayaaq tikitkuvsi nunaaqqimun aasii paġlaŋitpasi, aullaġumausi apqutiŋiññun aasii uqallaglusi, "
2560, ‘Even the dust of your town that clings to our feet we wipe off against you.

2561," I tell you, it will be more bearable on that day for Sodom than for that town! ","Uqallautigivsi, uvluani isivġiġvium, God naglikkutiqałhaaġniaqtuq iñuŋiññun Sodom taavrumaŋŋa nunaaqqimiñ tukkuliiŋitchuamiñ ilivsiññik."
2562," “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes. ","Qanutun naglignaqtigirusi ilivsi, Chorazin-miut. Qanutun naglignaqtigimmiusi ilivsi Bethsaida-ġmiut.

2566," Then the seventy-two returned with joy, saying, “Lord, even the demons submit to us in your name!” ","Utiŋarut 70 iḷitchitqurat quviasuutiqpaqaqłutiŋ, uqaqłutiŋ, Ataniiq ilitqusiqł̣uich unnii kamagigaatigut anittaqaptigik atqiñ atuqługu. "
2567," So he said to them, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Tautuŋagiga Satan kataktuaq igniġuuqpatittuatun qiḷaŋmiñ. "
2568," Look, I have given you authority to tread on snakes and scorpions and on the full force of the enemy, and nothing will hurt you.

2569," Nevertheless, do not rejoice that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice that your names stand written in heaven.” ","Aglaattauq quviatchakpautiginagu ilitqusiqł̣uich kamaksriñiŋat ilivsiññik, aglaan quviasukpagitchi atisi aglautiŋammata qiḷaŋmi."
2570," On that same occasion Jesus rejoiced in the Holy Spirit and said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your gracious will. ","Taavrumani ikarraġmi Ilitqusiġiksuam quviatchaktinniġaa Jesus, aasii uqallaktiłługu, Aapaaŋ, Atanġuruatiin qiḷaŋmun nunamullu, quyyavigigikpiñ tamatkua iriqsimaŋakapkich isumaturuaniñ kaŋiqsisiqaqtuaniḷḷu, aasii satqummiqł̣ugich iñuŋnun ukpiġutiqaqtuanun miqłiqtutun.

2574," Now an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus, saying, “Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?” ","Tavra pitquranik iḷisaurri makinŋaruq uuktuaqsaqługu, apiġivlugu Jesus, Iḷisaurrii, sumik piruksrauvik iñuuyumiñaqsisaġluŋa isuitchuamun? "

2576," The expert answered, “Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and love your neighbor as yourself.” ","Ilaan kiuŋagaa, Piviuttaġipiaqsaġiñ Ataniq God-igikkan, piviuttaġilugu iḷuŋniñ, iluqaaniḷu iñuuniaġniġni, iluqaaniḷu piḷġusiġñi, iluqaaniḷu isumaniġni, suli piviuttaġiraksraġigiñ siḷalliñ iliktun iḷiuġlugu.

2578," But the expert, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, “And who is my neighbor?” ","Tavra iḷisaurri pitquranik, kipiġniuqłuni patchisaitchukłuni inmiñi, apiġiŋagaa Jesus, Kiuva siḷalliġa? "
2579," Jesus replied, “A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who stripped him, beat him up, and went off, leaving him half dead. ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Iñuk aullaŋaruq Jerusalem-miñ Jericho-mun. Aasii kasuivḷuni tigligayuktinik, ilaisaasii annuġaiyaŋagaat anaumikł̣ugulu aasii qimakługu tuquanŋuqługu. "
2580," Now by chance a priest was going down that road, but when he saw the injured man he passed by on the other side. ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpak iglaummiñiqsuq tamatkunuuna apqutitigun, aasii tautukamiuŋ ikiḷik iñuk, qaaŋiqsaaŋagaa taavuunatchikun. "

2582," But a Samaritan who was traveling came to where the injured man was, and when he saw him, he felt compassion for him. ","Tavrali Samaritan-guruaq, iglauniallaġmi tikiññiqsuq ikiḷiŋmun iñuŋmun, aasii tautukługu nagliksratchaŋaruq. "
2583," He went up to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. ","Aasii ullakługu mamitaqtuŋagai kiḷḷiaġniŋi, kuviġaqługich uqsrumik wine-miglu, aasii qakiłługu kakaktimiñun, qaġġisiŋagaa tukkumaviŋmun, aasii qaunagiaqsivḷugu. "

2588," She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord’s feet and listened to what he said. ",Aasii aniqatiqaŋaruq atiqaqtuamik Mary-mik. Mary aquppiŋaruq sivuġaani Atanġum naalaġnivḷuni iḷisaurrutiŋiñik. 
2589," But Martha was distracted with all the preparations she had to make, so she came up to him and said, “Lord, don’t you care that my sister has left me to do all the work alone? Tell her to help me.” ","Tavrali Martha isumanŋutaniŋaruq pisigivlugu atqunaq savaŋnini, aasii ullakługu uqallautiŋagaa, Ataniiq, suliqutigiŋitpiuŋ aniqanma kisima savaurripkaġmaŋa?

2590," But the Lord answered her, “Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things, ","Tavra Atanġum kiuŋagaa, Martha, Martha, uŋiarirutin isumaalukpaitchutillu sutigun iñugiaktuatigun. "
2591, but one thing is needed. Mary has chosen the best part; it will not be taken away from her.”,Atausiq piraksraupiaqtuq. Mary-m piksraqtaaġiŋagaa nalaunŋaruaq. Piiġumiñaitchuq ilaaniñ.
2592," Now Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he stopped, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” ","Tavra Jesus iḷaanni aŋaiyyuŋalgitchuq, aasii aŋaiyyuaniŋman iḷaŋata iḷitchitquraŋisa uqallautiŋagaa, Ataniiq, iḷisauttutigut aŋaiyyuniġmik, John-tuttauq iḷisaurriruatun iḷitchitquraġmiñik aŋaiyyuniġmik. "
2593," So he said to them, “When you pray, say: ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Aŋaiyyuyumausi inna, Aapavut qiḷaŋmiittuatiin, iñuich qiksigilisin. Ilivich Atanniqsimakkich iñupayaat. Ilivich pisuutin taŋŋiqsauli nunami iluqaani qiḷaŋmi pimmatun. "

2597," and forgive us our sins, ","qanuq amma avilaitqatiga iglaaq tikitchuaq, aasii niqłiqsuutiksraitchuŋa. "
2598,for we also forgive everyone who sins against us. ,"Aasii ilaan kiulugu tatqamaŋŋamiñ. Iḷaksianaŋa. Upkuaq pitchiġiiyaŋaruq, miqłiqtutkalu uvaŋalu tuttaaŋarugut. Makitiġniaŋitchuŋa aitchuġuglutin supayaamik. "

2600," Then he said to them, “Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, ‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, ","Aŋaiyyuguvsi, qapiŋaiḷḷusi qiññuaqtuġitchi aitchuusiaqaġniaqtusi, qapiŋaiḷḷusi ivaqłiasitchi paqinniaġiksi ivakkaqsi, qapiŋaiḷḷusi tigluktuġitchi aasii upkuiġutiniaġaasi.

2605," For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks, the door will be opened. ","Tavra Jesus anitchiŋaruq ilitqusiqł̣uŋmik uqalaitchuamik. Aasii ilitqusiqł̣uk animman uqalaitchuaq iñuk uqallasiŋaruq, aasii iñuich aliuŋarut. "
2606," What father among you, if your son asks for a fish, will give him a snake instead of a fish? ","Tavrali iḷaŋich iñuich uqallaŋarut, Jesus anittairuq ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik suaŋŋataagun Beelzebul, umialgata ilitqusiqł̣uich. "

2608," If you then, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him!”","Tavra Jesus puttuqsrivḷugich isumaŋich, uqallautiŋagai, Nunauruat atinġiqł̣utiŋ aŋuyautikamiŋ inmiŋnun suksraunġiġuurut.

2609," Now he was casting out a demon that was mute. When the demon had gone out, the man who had been mute began to speak, and the crowds were amazed. ","Tainnatuttauq Satan ilitqusiqł̣uŋi atinġiġumiŋ piyuutilutiŋ avanmun, Satan suaŋŋataa isukłiññayaqtuq. Ilivsi uqaqtusi anittaiñivḷuŋa ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik suaŋŋataagun Beelzebul. "

2612," But Jesus, realizing their thoughts, said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and a divided household falls. ","Suaŋaruam iñuum, satkuaġigḷuataqłuni ittuam, munaġigaa igluqpakpani, aasii ilaan suġaliŋi iñuich iḷaksianiaŋitkaich. "
2613," So if Satan too is divided against himself, how will his kingdom stand? I ask you this because you claim that I cast out demons by Beelzebul. ","Aglaattauq iñuum saŋŋił̣haaqtuam ilaaniñ aŋuyakpagu payariḷugu, aatchumiñaġaa satkuŋiñik arguaŋŋatigikkaŋiñiglu, autaaġmiḷugich suġaliŋi piqatimiñun."
2614," Now if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ","Iñuk piqatauŋitchuaq uvamnun akiḷḷiuruq uvamnun, iñuktun ittuq kivriñaqsimman palauvaksranik, katitchiqataugaluaġnani siavsigiññaqtuatun."

2617," But when a stronger man attacks and conquers him, he takes away the first man’s armor on which the man relied and divides up his plunder.

2621," Then it goes and brings seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there, so the last state of that person is worse than the first.” ","Nineveh-mi iñuuŋaruatitun iḷitchuġivlugu aliuġnaqtuaq God-im Piŋaraŋa Jonah-mun, tainnatun iñuich paŋmapak iñuuruat iḷitchuġiniaqtut God-im aliuġnaqtuamik savaaŋanik Iġñiŋanun iñuum.

2622," As he said these things, a woman in the crowd spoke out to him, “Blessed is the womb that bore you and the breasts at which you nursed!” ","Isivġiġviŋmi aġnam umialgum akiḷḷiḷiġñiaġai iñuich iñuuruat paŋmapak aasii pasirauyumiñaqsiḷugich.

2646," from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation. ",
2647," Woe to you experts in religious law! You have taken away the key to knowledge! You did not go in yourselves, and you hindered those who were going in.”",
2648," When he went out from there, the experts in the law and the Pharisees began to oppose him bitterly, and to ask him hostile questions about many things, ",
2649," plotting against him, to catch him in something he might say.",
2650," Meanwhile, when many thousands of the crowd had gathered so that they were trampling on one another, Jesus began to speak first to his disciples, “Be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.

2665," He then told them a parable: “The land of a certain rich man produced an abundant crop, ","Tavra ilaan quliaqtuaġutiŋagai uuktuunmik uqaqłuni, Nunaŋa iñuum suġalliruam nauriqpaŋaruq. "
2666," so he thought to himself, ‘What should I do, for I have nowhere to store my crops?’ ","Aasii isumaŋaruq, Sulaŋatuġuvaŋa, qanuq uvva tutquqsiviksraitkaqsiruŋa sumun nauriamnik. "
2667," Then he said, ‘I will do this: I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. ","Tavra uqallaŋaruq, Innauvva piñiaqtuŋa.

2668," And I will say to myself, “You have plenty of goods stored up for many years; relax, eat, drink, celebrate!”’ ","Tavraasii uqallautiniaqtuŋa uvamnun, Piḷḷuataqtuŋaasuuvaŋa.

2669," But God said to him, ‘You fool! This very night your life will be demanded back from you, but who will get what you have prepared for yourself?’ ","Tavrali God-im uqallautiŋagaa suġalliruaq, Isumalluaġiitchuatiin.

2670," So it is with the one who stores up riches for himself, but is not rich toward God.”","Tavra Jesus uuktuun aġiusausiŋagaa, uqallakłuni, Tainnauvva iñuk ittuq nulauksiruaq suġaliġnik piksramiñik, ukpiġigaluaġnagu God."
2671," Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Taapkuniŋa uqallautigivsi, uŋiarrisiginagu iñuggurri, sumik niġiñiaqtilaaksraqsi, naaggaunnii sumik annuġaaġniaqtilaavsiññik. "
2672," For there is more to life than food, and more to the body than clothing. ","Qanuq iñuggun naumałhaaqtuq niqiksraqsiuqsiññaġniġmiñ, timisuli naumałhaaqtuq annuġaaniñ. "
2673," Consider the ravens: They do not sow or reap, they have no storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than the birds! ","Qiñiqsigik tulukkat.

2674, And which of you by worrying can add an hour to his life? ,Aasiiḷi nalliqsi iñuuniqtusiḷaaġumiñaitchuq uŋiarigiññaġluni. 
2675," So if you cannot do such a very little thing as this, why do you worry about the rest? ","Tavraasii piḷḷayumiñaiññiġuvsiuŋ tainnatun mikitigiruaqunnii, summan uŋiarrisaġivisigik tamatkua. "
2676," Consider how the flowers grow; they do not work or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was clothed like one of these! ","Qiñiqsigik nauriat qanuq nausuutilaaŋat, siġġaqilaitchut annuġarriulaitchullu, uqallautigivsi naaggauvva Solomon unnii qanutun kamanaqtigigaluaqłuni annuġaaŋaitchuq atautchisun-unnii tamatkunatun nauriatun qiñiyunaqtigiliġḷuni.

2677," And if this is how God clothes the wild grass, which is here today and tomorrow is tossed into the fire to heat the oven, how much more will he clothe you, you people of little faith!

2682," Sell your possessions and give to the poor. Provide yourselves purses that do not wear out – a treasure in heaven that never decreases, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.

2686," Blessed are those slaves whom their master finds alert when he returns!

2692, Blessed is that slave whom his master finds at work when he returns. ,Quviasugli taamna kivgaq atanġata qaigumi paqinniaqtaŋa tainna savaktuagulugu. 
2693," I tell you the truth, the master will put him in charge of all his possessions. ","Iḷumun uqallautigivsi, ilaan atanġata atanniutiniaġaa iluqaiññun suġaliġmiñun. "
2694," But if that slave should say to himself, ‘My master is delayed in returning,’ and he begins to beat the other slaves, both men and women, and to eat, drink, and get drunk, ","Tavraaglaan taamna kivgaq isummiġumi, Ataniġa qaiḷḷaiġutiruq, aasii anaumiaqsiḷugich aŋutit kivgat aġnallu kivgat, niġivḷuni imiqłuniḷu imiŋasivḷuniḷu. "
2695," then the master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not foresee, and will cut him in two, and assign him a place with the unfaithful. ","Atanġa taavruma kivgam qaiñiaqtuq uvlumi ilaanun niġiugvigiŋisaŋani suli kisumi ikarraġmi nalukkaŋani, aasii tatavsapiaġataġniaġaa, piqasiutilugu kamakkutaitchuanun."

2697," But the one who did not know his master’s will and did things worthy of punishment will receive a light beating. From everyone who has been given much, much will be required, and from the one who has been entrusted with much, even more will be asked.","Aglaan kivgaq naluruaq ataniġmi piraksriutaanik, pigaluaqtuaq ipiġaqtuusiaqaġnaġumiñaqtuamik, ipiġaqtuusiaqapiaġniaŋitchuq.

2707," As you are going with your accuser before the magistrate, make an effort to settle with him on the way, so that he will not drag you before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

2715," So he said to the worker who tended the vineyard, ‘For three years now, I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and each time I inspect it I find none. Cut it down! Why should it continue to deplete the soil?’ ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagaa napaaqtumik qaunaksri, Uvva, piŋasuni ukiuni ullaguugaluaġiga ivaqłiavluŋa siiġñanik mattumaŋŋa fig napaaqtuaniñ, aasii paqilaitchuŋa.

2718," Now he was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath, ",Tavra iḷaŋanni Jew-guruat savaiññiŋata Jesus iḷisaurriŋaruq aŋaiyyuviŋmi. 
2719, and a woman was there who had been disabled by a spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not straighten herself up completely. ,Tavra tavraniinŋaruq aġnaq ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuaq naŋititchiruamik ilaanik 18 ukiuni. Taamna aġnaq isivilaiñŋaniqsuq tainnatun sivisutigiruamik.

2722," But the president of the synagogue, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, said to the crowd, “There are six days on which work should be done! So come and be healed on those days, and not on the Sabbath day.” ","Tavrali umialiŋnaŋa aŋaiyyuvium, piavsaŋaruq pisigivlugu Jesus iłuaqsiriñiŋa Jew-guruat savaiññiŋanni.

2744," Now one Sabbath when Jesus went to dine at the house of a leader of the Pharisees, they were watching him closely. ","Iḷaŋanni Jew-guruat savairvianni, Jesus niġiqatauyaqtuġman igluanun atanaurauruam iḷauvluni Pharisee-ñun, iñuich Jesus naipiqtupiaŋagaat. "
2745, There right in front of him was a man suffering from dropsy. ,"Tavra tavrani, iñuk qaiŋaruq Jesus-mun immaqaġniqsuaq iluqaani timimiñi. "
2746," So Jesus asked the experts in religious law and the Pharisees, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?” ","Tavra Jesus apiġiŋagai pitquranik iḷisaurrich Pharisee-ḷḷu, uqallakłuni, Nalaunŋava iłuaqsiriruni Savaiññiġmi, naagga nalaunŋaitpa? "
2747," But they remained silent. So Jesus took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away. ",Tavra kiuŋaitkaat. Tavraniasii Jesus aksiuŋagaa naŋittuaq aasii iłuaqsivḷugu aullaqtiłługulu. 
2748," Then he said to them, “Which of you, if you have a son or an ox that has fallen into a well on a Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai iñuich, Nalliqsi iġñiqaġumi naagga qimuktiqaġumi kataktuamik nivviamun savaiññivsiññi, tavrauvvaa nuqitchaqtuġniaŋitpauŋ? "
2749, But they could not reply to this.,Iliŋisa kiuŋaitkaat taavrumuuna.
2750," Then when Jesus noticed how the guests chose the places of honor, he told them a parable. He said to them, ","Tavra Jesus iḷitchuġivlugich iḷaŋich aiyugaaqtauruat, iniksraqtuqtuat inigigñiqsranik, quliaqtuaġutiŋagai uuktuunmik iluqaisa. "
2751," “When you are invited by someone to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor, because a person more distinguished than you may have been invited by your host. ","Qakuguliqaa aiyugaaqpasi katirrusiqivlutiŋ niqinaqiruat, aquvinnasi inigigñiqsramun. Iḷaanni naumalluktuat ilivsiññiñ aiyugaaŋaviaġmigai. "
2752," So the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, ‘Give this man your place.’ Then, ashamed, you will begin to move to the least important place. ","Aasii taimma taavruma aiyugaaqłiŋaruam iluqavsiññik ullaglusi uqallautilusi, Iniksritchiuŋ una iñuk, taimaasii ilivsi kanŋutchautigillaan inillaaqsiḷusi kamanaiññiqsramun inimun. "
2753," But when you are invited, go and take the least important place, so that when your host approaches he will say to you, ‘Friend, move up here to a better place.’ Then you will be honored in the presence of all who share the meal with you. ","Aglaan aiyugaaqtauguvsi, aquvitchumausi kamanaiññiqsramun inimun, taavruma aiyugaaqtivsi qaiḷuni uqallautiyumagaasi, Avilaitqaan, qaiḷaaġiñ inigipayaamun. Tavraniasii kamanaqsiḷaaqtauniaqtutin takkuanni iluqaġmiŋ aiyugaaqtauruat. "
2754," For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.” ","Qanuq kiñaliqaa kamanaqsiḷiqtuaq inmiñik kamanaiqsauniaqtuq, suli kiñaliqaa kamasaaŋitchuaq inmiñi kamanaqsiḷiqtauniaqtuq."
2755," He said also to the man who had invited him, “When you host a dinner or a banquet, don’t invite your friends or your brothers or your relatives or rich neighbors so you can be invited by them in return and get repaid. ","Jesus suli uqallautiŋagaa aiyugaaqtini, Niġipkaiguvich naagga niqinaqurriguvich, aiyugaaġnagich avilaitqatitin naagga aniqatiitin, naagga nanmiñiq iḷatin naagga suġalliruat siḷallisin, ilaisaptauq aiyugaaqpiaġmigaatin paaqłiqsaġlutin. "
2756," But when you host an elaborate meal, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind. ","Aglaan niqinaqurriguvich, aiyugaakkich iḷiappaich, qilluutituqtuat, tusiattuat, ayauŋaruat, "
2757," Then you will be blessed, because they cannot repay you, for you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.”","aasii quviatchaktitauniaqtutin, qanuq ilaisa paaqłiġumiñaitkaatin. Tavra God-im paaqłiġñiaġaatin aŋikpata tuqqunmiñ nalaunŋaruat."
2758," When one of those at the meal with Jesus heard this, he said to him, “Blessed is everyone who will feast in the kingdom of God!” ","Tavra iḷaŋata niġġiviŋñi aquppiqatauruam Jesus-mun tusaakamiuŋ taamna, uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Quviasuglich iñuich niġiyumiñaġniaqtuat God-im atanniqsimaviani. "
2759," But Jesus said to him, “A man once gave a great banquet and invited many guests. ","Tavrali Jesus kiuŋagaa uuktuusiqł̣uni, Iñuk iḷaanni niqinaqusiuqpaŋaruq, aasii aiyugaaqługich iñugiaktuat iñuich. "
2760," At the time for the banquet he sent his slave to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, because everything is now ready.’ ","Tavra piñaqsimman niqinaqiniksraq, ilaan tiliŋagaa kivgani uqallautitquvlugich aiyugaaqtauŋaruat, Qaiñaqsigaasi. Supayaat paŋmapak itqanaiqsut. "
2761," But one after another they all began to make excuses. The first said to him, ‘I have bought a field, and I must go out and see it. Please excuse me.’ ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ atisivḷutiŋ patchisiqsurraqsiŋarut. Sivulliq uqallaŋaruq kivgamun, Nunasiŋaruŋa, aullaqtuksraupiaqtuŋa tautugiaġlugu. Apiġigikpiñ suliqutiginaŋa. "
2762," Another said, ‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I am going out to examine them. Please excuse me.’ ","Allasuli uqallaŋaruq, Tauqsiŋaruŋa tallimaiñik igḷugiiñik qimuktinik, aullaqtuksrauruŋa uuktuaġiaġlugich. Apiġigikpiñ suliqutiginaŋa. "
2763," Another said, ‘I just got married, and I cannot come.’ ","Allasuli uqallaŋaruq, Nuliaqqammiqsuŋa. Taamna pisigivlugu, aiyugaaqtauyumiñaitchuŋa. "
2764," So the slave came back and reported this to his master. Then the master of the household was furious and said to his slave, ‘Go out quickly to the streets and alleys of the city, and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.’ ","Tavra kivgam utiqami quliaqtuaġiŋagai taapkua ataniġmiñun.

2765," Then the slave said, ‘Sir, what you instructed has been done, and there is still room.’ ","Tavra kivgam utiqami uqallautiŋagaa, Ataniiq, piraksriutin pianiktuq, aasii iniqaqtuq suli. "
2766," So the master said to his slave, ‘Go out to the highways and country roads and urge people to come in, so that my house will be filled. ","Tavra atanġa uqallaŋaruq kivgamun, Aullavsaaġiñ apqutinun apqugauranullu siḷataanun iniqpaum aasii araglugich iñuich qaipkakkich, igluga siḷivitchumauq iñuŋnik. "
2767," For I tell you, not one of those individuals who were invited will taste my banquet!’”","Uqallautigivsi, nalliat unnii taipkua aiyugaaqtaugaluaqtuat niġiyumiñaiññiaqtut niqinaqusiuqtamnik. Tainna piñiaġmiuq God-im atanniqsimaviani."
2768," Now large crowds were accompanying Jesus, and turning to them he said, ","Tavra iñugiapiaġataqtuat iñusalaich iglauqasiŋagaat Jesus, aasii ilaan kiŋiaqługich uqallautiŋagai, "
2769," “If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters, and even his own life, he cannot be my disciple. ","Kiñaliqaa qairuaq uvamnun iḷitchitquraġiyumiñaitkiga piviuttaġiłhaaġumiñaitpaŋa ilaan aapamiñiñ, aakamiñiḷḷu, nuliamiñiḷḷu, miqłiqtumiñiḷḷu, aniqatiimiñiḷḷu, inmiñiñunniiḷu. "
2770, Whoever does not carry his own cross and follow me cannot be my disciple. ,"Kialiqaa iqsriutiŋitkumiuŋ aŋarraurani tuqutauyumaliġḷuniunnii pisigiluŋa, nalliummatiŋitchuq iḷitchitqurauyumiñaġluni uvamnun. "
2771," For which of you, wanting to build a tower, doesn’t sit down first and compute the cost to see if he has enough money to complete it? ","Qanuq nalliqsi, nappaiyumaalliġumi nasiqsruġviŋmik, aquptaaġluni kisitchiqqaaġniaŋitpa qanutun akisutilaaksraŋanik naamaniaġaluaġmagaaġmi naatchumiñaġlugu? "
2772," Otherwise, when he has laid a foundation and is not able to finish the tower, all who see it will begin to make fun of him. ","Tainna piŋisuaġumi, maŋŋuliqsiññaġlugu naatchiyumiñaiññiqpan, iñuich tautukkumirruŋ kipautigirraqsiñiaġaat, "
2773," They will say, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish!’ ","uqaġlutiŋ, Iñugliuna nappaisaġaluaqłuni, naatchiyumiñaiḷḷaġmi pimmiñiqsuq. "
2774," Or what king, going out to confront another king in battle, will not sit down first and determine whether he is able with ten thousand to oppose the one coming against him with twenty thousand? ","Naagga kisu umialik, aŋuyaqatiqaqsaġumaagaqsigumi allamik umialiŋmik, naipiqtuqqaaġniaŋitpa isumalaaġutigiaqsiḷugu igḷutuutiyumiñaġniaqtilaamiñik 10,000-mik aŋuyaktiqaġluni 20,000-mik aŋuyaktiqaqtuamun. "
2775," If he cannot succeed, he will send a representative while the other is still a long way off and ask for terms of peace. ","Igḷutuutiyumiñaiññiaġumi, uŋasisugruŋŋaan akiḷḷiñi, ilaa tilisiñiaqtuq kivgamik umialiŋmun apiqsrisaqłuni aŋuyaŋirrutiksramik. "
2776, In the same way therefore not one of you can be my disciple if he does not renounce all his own possessions.,"Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Tainnatun kiñaliqaa ilivsiññi suksraaġiŋitkumi supayaanik pigikkaġmiñik, iḷitchitqurauyumiñaitchuq uvamnun."
2777," “Salt is good, but if salt loses its flavor, how can its flavor be restored? ","Taġiuq nakuuruq, aglaattauq taġiuq taġiuġniiġumi, qanuġlugu taġiuġniḷitqikkumiñaitchuq. "
2778, It is of no value for the soil or for the manure pile; it is to be thrown out. The one who has ears to hear had better listen!”,"Anniqsuutauyumiñaitchuq nunamun naagga nagguksautauyumiñaġluni nunamun. Aglaan naavitaksrauruq asiñun.

2779, Now all the tax collectors and sinners were coming to hear him. ,Iḷaanni tax-iñik katitchirit piḷuusiqirillu qaiŋarut Jesus naalaktuaġukługu. 
2780," But the Pharisees and the experts in the law were complaining, “This man welcomes sinners and eats with them.” ","Tavra Pharisees iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik uqamayuŋarut uqaqłutiŋ, Uuma iñuum paġlasuugai piḷuusiqirit niġiqatigivlugiḷḷu. "
2781, So Jesus told them this parable: ,Tavra Jesus uqautiŋagai uumiŋa uuktuunmik.
2782," “Which one of you, if he has a hundred sheep and loses one of them, would not leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture and go look for the one that is lost until he finds it? ","Nalliqsi qanuġayaqpa tallimakipiamik imnaiqaqtuaq tammaigumi atautchimik? Qimakkayaġai tallimakipiaġuutaitchuat, aasii ivaaqsiḷugu atausiq tammaqtuaq imnaiq paqilġataġlugu. "
2783," Then when he has found it, he places it on his shoulders, rejoicing. ",Tavraasii paqinnamiuŋ quviasukpaŋaruq. Aasii iqsriutivlugu aggisivlugu. 
2784," Returning home, he calls together his friends and neighbors, telling them, ‘Rejoice with me, because I have found my sheep that was lost.’ ","Tavra aikami, ququaŋagai atautchimun avilaitqatini siḷalliñiḷu, uqallautivlugich, Quviasuqasiqsiŋa, qanuq paqinŋagiga imnaiġa tammaŋaruaq. "
2785," I tell you, in the same way there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who have no need to repent.","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Uqallautigivsi, tainnatuttauq quviasuutigiłhamaaġniaġaat qiḷaŋmi atausiq piḷuusiqiri isumalitqiksuaq taapkunaŋŋa tallimakipiaġuutaitchuaniñ nalaunŋaruaniñ iñuŋniñ isumalitqiaksraitchuaniñ."
2786," “Or what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one of them, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search thoroughly until she finds it? ",Naagga aġnaq qanuġayaqpa qulinik maniuraqaqtuaq tammaigumiuŋ atausiq iḷaŋat maniŋmi? Ikinnayaġaa qulliq aasii tilaiḷugu igluni ivammaġiksaapiaġataġlugu paqilġataġlugu. 
2787," Then when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, ‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin that I had lost.’ ","Aasii paqitanikamiuŋ, ququaqługich atautchimun avilaitqatini siḷalliñiḷu uqallakłuni, Quviasuqasiqsiŋa qanuq paqinŋagiga maniuraq tammaikkaġa. "
2788," In the same way, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of God’s angels over one sinner who repents.”","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Uqallautigivsi tainnatuttauq quviasuŋmiut isaġuliŋi God-im pisigivlugu atausiq piḷuusiqiri isumalitqiŋman."
2789," Then Jesus said, “A man had two sons. ","Jesus uqallavsaaŋaruq, Iñuk malġugnik iġñiqaŋaruq. "
2790," The younger of them said to his father, ‘Father, give me the share of the estate that will belong to me.’ So he divided his assets between them. ","Nukaqłiq uqallaŋaruq aapamiñun, Aapaaŋ, aitchuŋŋa kiŋuvaannaktaaksrautimnik. Tavra Aapaŋakta autaaŋagai suġaliġni iġñagmiñun. "
2791," After a few days, the younger son gathered together all he had and left on a journey to a distant country, and there he squandered his wealth with a wild lifestyle. ","Uvliupasakkaluaġnani, nukaqłium tuniŋagai autaaġusiani maniŋñun, aasii aullaqłuni uŋasiksuamun nunamun. Taamaniasii kinniqutigiaqsivḷugich maniŋñi iñuumaqłuktaqłuni. "
2792," Then after he had spent everything, a severe famine took place in that country, and he began to be in need. ","Tavra suiġutianiŋmiuġlu, kaaksiuqparraqsiŋarut taavrumani nunami, aasii ilaa suiġutiŋaruq. "
2793," So he went and worked for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. ","Tavra ilaa aullaqłuni iḷaliutiŋaruq iḷaŋannun nutim iñuŋisa taavruma nunam, aasii taavruma iñuum tiliŋagaa nautchiaqaġviŋmiñun qaunaksritquvlugu tuttuqłuŋnik. "
2794," He was longing to eat the carob pods the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. ","Tavra kaaliqpaił̣ł̣uni niġiyumiñaġaluaġaqtuq tuttuqłuich niqiŋiññik, suli iñuich aitchulaitkaat. "
2795," But when he came to his senses he said, ‘How many of my father’s hired workers have food enough to spare, but here I am dying from hunger! ","Tavra qauriḷġataqami uqallaŋaruq, Qanutun iñugiaktigiruanik aapaga akiññagniaqtuanik kivgaqaqtuq niqaiḷḷisaaŋitchuanik aitchuutiksraqallavlutiglu, uvvaliasiuvaŋa maani paniaqsiruŋa. "

","Tavra ilaa utiqsaŋaruq aapamiñun. Tavrali uŋasisugruktillugusuli, aapaŋan tautuŋagaa aasii naglikkiutivlugu, aqpamik iqimmaaġiaqtuŋagaa iġñini kunikł̣ugulu. "

2802," because this son of mine was dead, and is alive again – he was lost and is found!’ So they began to celebrate. ","Qanuq uvvauna iġñiġa tuquŋaruatun itkaluaqtuaq iñuusatqiksuq, tammaŋagaluaqtuaq paqitauruq. Tavra niqinaqirraqsiŋarut."

2804, So he called one of the slaves and asked what was happening. ,Tavra ilaan qaitquŋagaa kivgat iḷaŋat aasii apiġivlugu summagaisa. 
2805," The slave replied, ‘Your brother has returned, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got his son back safe and sound.’ ","Aasii kivgam kiuŋagaa, Aniqatin airuaq aasii aapan tuqutchiruaq quiññaksaqtamik tuttuqpaiyaamik, pisigivlugu aiñiŋa sugaluaġnani. "

2807," but he answered his father, ‘Look! These many years I have worked like a slave for you, and I never disobeyed your commands.

2810," It was appropriate to celebrate and be glad, for your brother was dead, and is alive; he was lost and is found.’”","Nalautittuq quviasualaniksraqput quyaniksraqpullu, qanuq aniqatin tuquŋaruatun itkaluaqtuaq iñuusatqiksuq, suli tammaŋagaluaqtuaq paqitauruq."
2811," Jesus also said to the disciples, “There was a rich man who was informed of accusations that his manager was wasting his assets. ","Jesus uqallautivsaaŋagai iḷitchitqurani uuktuusiqł̣uni, Iñuqaŋaruq suġalliruamik suġautchiqiriqaqtuamik. Aasii uqallautiŋagaat suġalliruaq suġautchiqiriŋa aŋalatchiḷḷuataŋiññivḷugu maniŋiñik. "
2812," So he called the manager in and said to him, ‘What is this I hear about you? Turn in the account of your administration, because you can no longer be my manager.’ ","Tavra suġalliruam ququaqługu uqallautiŋagaa, Sunaimña tusaavigu ilipkun?

2813," Then the manager said to himself, ‘What should I do, since my master is taking my position away from me? I’m not strong enough to dig, and I’m too ashamed to beg.

2815," So he contacted his master’s debtors one by one. He asked the first, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ ","Tavra qaitquŋagai umialiŋmi akiiḷaqtuqtiŋi atausiullaavlugich. Sivulliq uqallautiŋagaa, Qanutun akiiḷaqpiuŋ umialiga? "

2818, The master commended the dishonest manager because he acted shrewdly. For the people of this world are more shrewd in dealing with their contemporaries than the people of light. ,Tavra atanġata pisaasuġniŋagaa pitqiksiġayuktuaq suġautchiqiri sivunniuġutaagun.

2824, The Pharisees (who loved money) heard all this and ridiculed him. ,"Pharisees piqpaksriruat maniŋmik, tusaaŋagaich taapkua iluqaisa uqaluich aasii ilaisa Jesus kipagiŋagaat. "
2825," But Jesus said to them, “You are the ones who justify yourselves in men’s eyes, but God knows your hearts. For what is highly prized among men is utterly detestable in God’s sight.","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Ilivsi patchisaiññisuurusi takkuanni iñuich, aglaan God-im iḷisimapiaġai iñuutchisi, qanuq suna kamanaqsiḷiqtauruaq akunġanni iñuich naġġugipiaġataġaa God-im."

2828," “Everyone who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery, and the one who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery.","Kiñaliqaa avittuaq nuliamiñiñ aasii tuvaaqasitqikł̣uni allamik allatuqtuaguruq, suli iñuk tuvaaqasiqsuaq aġnamik avitaŋanik uiŋata, allatuqtuaguruq."
2829, “There was a rich man who dressed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. ,"Suġalliruaqaŋaruq annuġaaqaqtuamik akisupiaġataqtuanik, suli uvlutuaġman niqinaqiugaqłuni iḷaŋaniñ. "
2830," But at his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus whose body was covered with sores, ","Aasii iñuk iḷiappak kiḷḷiġruaqtuqtuaq atiqaqtuaq Lazarus-mik, qaġġisisuuniġaat uvlutuaġman paaŋanun suġalliruam. "

2834," So he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in this fire.’ ","Tavra ilaa ququulaŋaruq, Aapauruatiin Abraham, nagligiŋŋa.

2843, It would be better for him to have a millstone tied around his neck and be thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin. ,"Kialiqaa ukpiġutaiqsitpagu iḷaŋat makua miqłiqtuuratun iḷivḷutiŋ ukpiqtuat uvamnun, iłuałhaaġayaqtuq uyaġagruaġmik quŋusiġutchiġḷugu aasii ipipkaġlugu taġiumun.

2847," So the Lord replied, “If you had faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this black mulberry tree, ‘Be pulled out by the roots and planted in the sea,’ and it would obey you.

2850," He won’t thank the slave because he did what he was told, will he? ",Kivgaq quyanaagaksraitchuq kamaksriñiḷugu piraksriusiamiñik.

2852," Now on the way to Jerusalem, Jesus was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. ","Iglauyaamiñi Jerusalem-mun, Jesus akunġakkuaŋaruq Samaria-vlu Galilee-vḷu. "
2853," As he was entering a village, ten men with leprosy met him. They stood at a distance, ","Tavra tikitchaġataviksillugich nunaaqqiñun, paaŋagaat qulit kiḷḷiġruaqtuqtuat, qikausiŋarut uŋasiuraqłutiŋ "
2854," raised their voices and said, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” ","aasii ququulaŋarut, Jesus Ataniiq nagligitigut. "
2855," When he saw them he said, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went along, they were cleansed. ","Tavra Jesus tautukamigich uqallautiŋagai, Aullaġitchi aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich mamitilaaġumagaasi. Tavra iglauniallaġmiŋ maminŋarut. "
2856," Then one of them, when he saw he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice. ","Tavra iḷaŋat, iḷitchuġikami iłuaqsirautilaamiñik, utiqsaŋaruq, nanġaqługu God nipatuvluni. "
2857, He fell with his face to the ground at Jesus’ feet and thanked him. (Now he was a Samaritan.) ,"Tavra punŋaruq sivuġaanun Jesus, quyyavigivlugu. Taamna iñuk Samaria-ġmiu. "
2858," Then Jesus said, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the other nine? ","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq, quliguŋitpat ipkua mamittuat? Nauŋ ipkua quliŋŋuġutaiḷat? "
2859, Was no one found to turn back and give praise to God except this foreigner?” ,Utiġumiñaŋagaluaġmiut quyyavigisuglugu God. Aglaan uvvauna Samaria-ġmiu utiŋaruq. 
2860," Then he said to the man, “Get up and go your way. Your faith has made you well.” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Makillutin aullaġiñ. Ukpiġurvich iłuaqsipkaġaatin."
2861," Now at one point the Pharisees asked Jesus when the kingdom of God was coming, so he answered, “The kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed, ","Iḷaŋisa Pharisees apiġiŋagaat Jesus qakugu atanniqsimmataa God-im isagutiniaġmagaan. Ilaan kiuŋagai, Atanniqsimmataa God-im isagutiyumaaŋitchuq tautuŋnaġluni. "
2862," nor will they say, ‘Look, here it is!’ or ‘There!’ For indeed, the kingdom of God is in your midst.”","Naaggaunnii uqallagniaŋiñmiut, Uvva uvaniittuq. Naagga taikka taikaniittuq, qanuq atanniqsimmataa God-im ittuq uvaniittuani kamaksriruani."
2863," Then he said to the disciples, “The days are coming when you will desire to see one of the days of the Son of Man, and you will not see it. ","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq iḷitchitquramiñun, Uvlut qaiyumaaqtut kipiġniuliġviksrautisi tautugumaliġḷugu atanniqsimmataa Iġñiŋan iñuum nunami, aglaan tautukkumiñaitkiksi. "
2864," Then people will say to you, ‘Look, there he is!’ or ‘Look, here he is!’ Do not go out or chase after them. ","Tavraasii iñuich uqallautiniaġaasi qaiñiḷuŋa aasii amaniinniḷuŋa naagga maaniinniḷuŋa. Ukpiġinagich, ivaqsaġnaŋa. "
2865," For just like the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one side to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his day. ","Qanuq igniġuuqpatittuaq qaummaatinmatun qaummaġiksiviñaqługu qiḷak igḷuaniñ igḷuanun, tainnatun piñiaqtuq Iġñiŋa iñuum qaigumi. "
2866, But first he must suffer many things and be rejected by this generation. ,Aglaan nagliksaaqqaaqtuksrauniaqtuŋa iñugiaktuatigun sutigun suli pisuŋiḷḷuŋa iñuich paŋmapak iñuuruat. 
2867," Just as it was in the days of Noah, so too it will be in the days of the Son of Man. ","Taimani Noah iñuumman iñuuruatitun, tainnatuttauq iñuusiqaġniaġmiut qaiyasikpan Iġñiŋa iñuum. "
2868," People were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage – right up to the day Noah entered the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed them all. ","Iñuich niġigayuktut, imiqłutiglu katirrusiqivlutiglu Noah isiġataqtillugu umiaqpaŋmiñun, aasii uliqpaum tuqunŋagai iluqaisa. "
2869," Likewise, just as it was in the days of Lot, people were eating, drinking, buying, selling, planting, building; ","Tainnatuttauq iñuumman Lot, niġigayuŋammiut imiqłutiglu tauqsiqsuqłutiglu tuniuqqaivḷutiglu nautchirriqsuivḷutiglu igluqpiuqłutiglu "
2870," but on the day Lot went out from Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all. ",aullaġataqtillugu Lot Sodom-miñ. Tavra igniq tivluktuaġlu isiq sialuuŋaruk qiḷaŋmiñ aasii tuqułługich iluqaisa iñuŋi Sodom. 
2871, It will be the same on the day the Son of Man is revealed. ,Tavra tainnatun piñiaqtuq Iġñiŋa iñuum qiñiġnaqsikpan.
2872," On that day, anyone who is on the roof, with his goods in the house, must not come down to take them away, and likewise the person in the field must not turn back. ",Taimanigu iñuk aniiqsuaqtuaq iglumi qaaŋani atqaġnani suġauttani iglum iḷuaniittuat aisuglugich. Tainnatuttauq iñuk nautchiaqaġviŋmiittuaq utiqsaġnani iglumiñun. 
2873, Remember Lot’s wife! ,Itqaumasiuŋ suna piruaq Lot-gum nuliaŋanun. 
2874," Whoever tries to keep his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it. ","Kialiqaa annautiniaqsaagumigich iñuuniutini tammaiñiaġaa iñuggutini, aglaan kialiqaa tammaigumigich iñuuniutini annautiniaġaa iñuggutini. "
2875," I tell you, in that night there will be two people in one bed; one will be taken and the other left. ","Uqallautigivsi, taavrumani unnuami malġuk aŋutik inniaqtuk atautchiiñi siñigviŋñi, igḷua aullaurrauniaqtuq aasii igḷua qimaktauluni. "

2877," Then the disciples said to him, “Where, Lord?” He replied to them, “Where the dead body is, there the vultures will gather.”","Malġuk aŋutik nautchiaqaġviŋmi savaŋniaqtuk, igḷua aullaurrauniaqtuq aasii igḷua qimaktauluni. "
2878, Then Jesus told them a parable to show them they should always pray and not lose heart. ,"Tavra Jesus quliaqtuaġutiŋagai uumiŋa uuktuunmik, iḷisautisaqługich ataramik aŋaiyyuruksraunivḷugich nikatchalaiḷḷutiŋ. "
2879," He said, “In a certain city there was a judge who neither feared God nor respected people. ","Ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Iniqpaŋmi isivġiqsiqaŋaruq qiksiksrautaitchuamik God-mun naaggaunnii suliqutiksraaqtuaŋitchuamik iñuŋnik. "
2880," There was also a widow in that city who kept coming to him and saying, ‘Give me justice against my adversary.’ ",Tavra inŋaruq uiḷgaŋaruaq taavrumani iniqpaŋmi ullaaġautiruaq isivġiqsimun nalaunŋaruakun ikayuquvluni iñuŋmiñ ivayaġniaqtimiñiñ.

2882," yet because this widow keeps on bothering me, I will give her justice, or in the end she will wear me out by her unending pleas.’” ","pisigigiññaġlugu uuma uiḷgaŋaruam iḷaksianniŋniŋa uvamnik, ikayuġniaġiga nalaunŋaruakun ilaanun, qanuq ikayuŋisuaġupku piḷaiqsinniaġaaŋa ataramik qaiguġluni.

2883," And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge says! ","Tavra Ataniq uqallaŋaruq, Isummatigisiuŋ qanuq nalaunŋaitchuaq isivġiqsim isumallautaa. "
2884," Won’t God give justice to his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he delay long to help them? ",Tainnatuttauq God isivġiiñiaqtuq pisilugich ilaan iñuksraqtaani nipauqtuat inmiñun ikayuqtaiḷiqivlutiŋ uvlukkaluami unnuamiḷu. Ikayukallaŋisauraaġniaqpagich?

2886, Jesus also told this parable to some who were confident that they were righteous and looked down on everyone else. ,Jesus quliaqtuavsaaŋammiuq uumiŋa uuktuunmik iñuŋnun nalupqisuŋitchuanun nalaunŋanivḷutiŋ aasii suuŋiḷaqsruqługich allat iñuich.

2888," The Pharisee stood and prayed about himself like this: ‘God, I thank you that I am not like other people: extortionists, unrighteous people, adulterers – or even like this tax collector. ","Pharisee makitavluni aŋaiyyuŋaruq inna, God, quyanaaġikpiñ iñuusiqaŋiññama allatun iñuktitun, piḷḷaturuatun, pitqiksiġaqtitun, allatuqtitun, naaggaunnii uumatun tax-iñik katitchiritun. "

2890," The tax collector, however, stood far off and would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, ‘God, be merciful to me, sinner that I am!’ ","Tavrali tax-iñik katitchiri, makitavluni taavanisaaq, aaġluqsausiiñŋaruq unnii qiḷaŋmun, aglaan patiksiññaqługu satqani aŋaiyyuŋaruq inna, God nagligiŋŋa uvaŋa piḷuusiqiri.

2891," I tell you that this man went down to his home justified rather than the Pharisee.

2892," Now people were even bringing their babies to him for him to touch. But when the disciples saw it, they began to scold those who brought them. ","Tavrani iñuich iḷaŋisa qaġġisiŋagaich miqłiqtuuratiŋ Jesus-mun, aksiuquvlugich ilaanun. Tavra iḷitchitqurat tautukamisigik, suaŋagaich iñuich. "

2896," Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Summan taiviŋa nakuuruamik. Nakuuruagitchuq iñuŋmik God kisimi. "
2897," You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’” ","Iḷisimagitin Pitqurat, Allatuġnak, Iñuaġnak, Tiglignak, Saglutiginniŋnak, Suuŋiḷaġinagik aapallu aakallu. "
2898," The man replied, “I have wholeheartedly obeyed all these laws since my youth.” ","Tavra umialiŋnam kiuŋagaa, Tamatkua iluqaisa kamagiŋagitka nutaġaunnamniñ. "
2899," When Jesus heard this, he said to him, “One thing you still lack. Sell all that you have and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me.” ","Tavra Jesus taamna tusaakamiuŋ, ilaan uqallautiŋagaa, Atautchimik piraksraqavsaaqtutin suli.

2900," But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was extremely wealthy. ","Tavra taamna tusaakamiuŋ ipiqtutchaŋaruq, qanuq suġalliqpaktuaguvluni."
2901," When Jesus noticed this, he said, “How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! ","Jesus qiviaqługu ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Qanutun siġḷiġnaqtigiva tamatkunuŋa suġalliruanun isiġniaġniksraq God-im atanniqsimavianun. "

2908," Then Jesus took the twelve aside and said to them, “Look, we are going up to Jerusalem, and everything that is written about the Son of Man by the prophets will be accomplished. ","Tavra asivaqtaaġutivlugich qulit malġuk iḷitchitqurat, Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Uvva, Jerusalem-muksaaqsirugut, aasii supayaat uqaqtiŋisa God-im aglaaġiŋaraŋich Iġñiŋagun iñuum nalautitauniaqtut. "
2909," For he will be handed over to the Gentiles; he will be mocked, mistreated, and spat on. ","Tavra ilaa aitchuutauniaqtuq Jew-guŋitchuanun, suli kipaginiaġaat kanŋunaqsipiaġlugu aŋalataġilugu tivvuaqtuġlugulu. "

2911," But the twelve understood none of these things. This saying was hidden from them, and they did not grasp what Jesus meant.","Tavra iḷitchitqurat kaŋiqsiŋaitkaich nalliat unnii tamatkua uqaluich, taamna uqaluk kaŋiqsiŋaitkaat sumik sivuniqaqtilaaŋa, puttuqsriŋiḷḷakkaat sumik Jesus uqautiqaqtilaaŋanik."
2912," As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the road begging. ","Tavra Jesus qallimmiuġlu Jericho-mun, ayauŋaruaq aquppiŋaruq apqutit saniġaanni piatchiaqtaqłuni. "
2913," When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was going on. ","Tavra tusaavlugich iñusalaich tamaunnaaqtuat, ilaa apiqsriŋaruq summagaisa. "
2914," They told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.” ","Ilaisa uqallautiŋagaat, Jesus Nazareth-miu tamaunnaaqtuq. "
2915," So he called out, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” ","Tavra ilaa nipaalaŋaruq, Jesus, Iġñiġuruatiin David-mun, nagligiŋŋa. "
2916," And those who were in front scolded him to get him to be quiet, but he shouted even more, “Son of David, have mercy on me!” ","Tavra tamatkua salliuruat suaŋagaat, uqallautivlugu nipaisaaquvlugu. Tavra ilaa nipattuvsaaqsiññaŋaruq, Iġñiġuruatiin David-mun, nagligiŋŋa. "
2917," So Jesus stopped and ordered the beggar to be brought to him. When the man came near, Jesus asked him, ","Tavra Jesus nutqaŋaruq, aasii piraksriivḷuni qaġġisitquvlugu inmiñun. Tavra qallimman Jesus apiġiŋagaa, "
2918," “What do you want me to do for you?” He replied, “Lord, let me see again.” ","Sumik pisitquvich uvamnun. Ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Ataniiq, tautuksiḷḷasisuktuŋa. "
2919," Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has healed you.” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Tautuksiḷḷasiiñ, ukpiġurvich iłuaqsipkaġaatin. "
2920," And immediately he regained his sight and followed Jesus, praising God. When all the people saw it, they too gave praise to God.","Tavra tavrauvvaa ilaa tautullasiŋaruq aasii Jesus malikługu, nanġaqługu God. Tavra iluqaġmiŋ iñuich tautukamirruŋ, God nanġaŋagaat."
2921, Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it. ,Jesus tikiñŋaruq Jericho-mun aasii iglauvigiaqsivḷugu. 
2922, Now a man named Zacchaeus was there; he was a chief tax collector and was rich. ,"Tavra iñuqaŋaruq atiqaqtuamik Zacchaeus-mik, umialguniqsuamik tax-iñik katitchirauruanun, suli suġalliruaguvluni. "
2923," He was trying to get a look at Jesus, but being a short man he could not see over the crowd. ","Tavra ilaan tautuŋniataŋagaa Jesus tautulaiñmivḷugulu, iñuich iñugiakpaił̣ł̣utiŋ ilaalu mikivluni. "
2924," So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, because Jesus was going to pass that way. ","Tavra aqpamik isagutiŋaruq sivuniksraŋannun aasii mayuqłuni Sikamuam napaaqtuanun tautugukługu Jesus, qanuq tamaunnaaġumaaqtuq. "
2925," And when Jesus came to that place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because I must stay at your house today.” ","Tavra Jesus tikiññami tavruŋa, aaġluqłuni uqallautiŋagaa, Zacchaeus, atqaġiñ qilamik, qanuq igluŋniittuksrauruŋa uvlupak. "
2926, So he came down quickly and welcomed Jesus joyfully. ,"Tavra Zacchaeus atqaqsaaluŋaruq, aasii aiyugaaŋagaa Jesus quviasuutigivlugu. "
2927," And when the people saw it, they all complained, “He has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner.” ","Tavra iñuich tautukamirruŋ taamna iluqaġmiŋ uqamayurraqsiŋarut, Taamna iñuk tuyuġmiaguyyaqtuq piḷuusiqirimun. "
2928," But Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, half of my possessions I now give to the poor, and if I have cheated anyone of anything, I am paying back four times as much!” ","Aglaalli Zacchaeus makiłłuni sivuġaanun uqallaŋaruq Ataniġmun, Ataniiq, avvaŋich suġaliġma aitchuutiginiaġitka iḷiappauruanun, suli saglutaġniġupku kiñapayaaq supayaakun, utiqtitchiviginiaġiga sisamaŋŋuġlugu.

2929," Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this household, because he too is a son of Abraham! ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Taamna pisigivlugu, uvlupak una iñuk igluqatiniḷu annaurrausaqtut, ilaaptauq kiŋunġuvluni Abraham-mun. "

2931," While the people were listening to these things, Jesus proceeded to tell a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately. ","Tavra tamatkua tusaaruat uqaluŋnik, Jesus quliaqtuaġutiŋagai uuktuunmik. Ilaa qalliŋaruq Jerusalem-mun, aasii iñuich isumaqaŋarut atanniqsimmataa God-im satqummiyasiñasugalugu. "
2932," Therefore he said, “A nobleman went to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and then return. ","Tavra ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Iñuk umialiŋniñ kaŋiqaqtuaq aullaŋaruq uŋasiksuamun nunamun umialguqtitausukłuni, aasii utiġmiḷuni. "
2933," And he summoned ten of his slaves, gave them ten minas, and said to them, ‘Do business with these until I come back.’ ","Aullaŋaiñŋaġmi qaitquŋagai qulit kivgani, aasii aitchullaavlugich atausiḷḷaanik kaviqsuanik maniŋñik, aasii uqallautivlugich, Naggutinnagniaġitchi ukuniŋa maniŋñik qaiñimnun aglaan. "
2934," But his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’ ","Tavra nunatqatiŋisa uumigiŋagaat aasii tilisiŋarut kivgamik inmiŋniñ aquagun, uqaqłutiŋ, Uvagut umialigisuŋitkikput taamna iñuk."
2935," When he returned after receiving the kingdom, he summoned these slaves to whom he had given the money. He wanted to know how much they had earned by trading. ","Umialiguġiaqtuaq umialiguanikami utiŋaruq. Tavrauvvaa qaitquŋagai taapkua kivgani aitchuŋarani maniŋñik, iḷitchuġisukłuni qanutun naggutinnaktilaaŋannik. "

2942," The king said to him, ‘I will judge you by your own words, you wicked slave! So you knew, did you, that I was a severe man, withdrawing what I didn’t deposit and reaping what I didn’t sow?

2944," And he said to his attendants, ‘Take the mina from him, and give it to the one who has ten.’ ","Tavra umialik uqallaŋaruq tamatkunuŋa makitaruanun saniġaani, Pisigik kaviqsuat maniich ilaaniñ, aasii qaiḷḷugich taavrumuŋa kivgamun qulinik maniqaqtuamun. "

2948," After Jesus had said this, he continued on ahead, going up to Jerusalem. ","Taamna uqausiġianikamiuŋ, Jesus aullaqivsaaŋaruq Jerusalem-mun sivuanni iñuich. "
2949," Now when he approached Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, ","Tavra qallikami Bethphage-mun Bethany-mullu, tikiññamiŋ iġġimun atiqaqtuamun Olives, ilaa tilisiŋaruq malġugnik iḷitchitquramiñiñ, "
2950," telling them, “Go to the village ahead of you. When you enter it, you will find a colt tied there that has never been ridden. Untie it and bring it here.

2952, So those who were sent ahead found it exactly as he had told them. ,Tavra taapkuak tilirauruak aullaŋaruk aasii paqinŋagaak Jesus uqausiatun inmiŋnun. 
2953," As they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, “Why are you untying that colt?” ","Tavra pituiqsisaġniaqtillugik kakaktimik, iñuŋisa kakaktim uqallautiŋagaik, Summan pituigaqsivitku kakakti? "
2954," They replied, “The Lord needs it.” ","Tavra iliŋik uqallaŋaruk, Atanġum atuġukkaa. "
2955," Then they brought it to Jesus, threw their cloaks on the colt, and had Jesus get on it. ","Tavra iliŋikta qaġġisiŋagaak kakakti Jesus-mun, aasii iñuich qalliqsuutivlugich annuġaatiŋ kakaktimun, Jesus kakaksirraqsiŋaruq. "
2956," As he rode along, they spread their cloaks on the road. ","Tavra kakaksiqsillugu, iñuich siaminŋagaich annuġaatiŋ apqutinun. "
2957," As he approached the road leading down from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of his disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the mighty works they had seen: ","Tavra qallimman Jerusalem-mun, atqaġiaŋanun iḷimman iġġimun Olives-mun, iñusalaich iḷitchitquraŋi quviatcharraqsiŋarut suli nanġaqługu God nipatuvlutiŋ, pisigivlugich iluqaisa kamanaqtuat savaat tautuŋaratiŋ, "

2961," Now when Jesus approached and saw the city, he wept over it, ","Tavra Jesus qallikami tautukługu iniqpak qirratigiŋagai Jerusalem iñuŋi, "
2962," saying, “If you had only known on this day, even you, the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes. ","uqaqłuni, Uvvaunnii uvlupak puttuqsriyumiñaġaluaqtusi suruksrautilaavsiññik tutqiutiqaġukkuvsi. Aglaan paŋmapak puttuqsriŋitchusi. "

2964," They will demolish you – you and your children within your walls – and they will not leave within you one stone on top of another, because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”","Aasii iliŋisa suksraunġipiallagniaġaasi iniqpaksiḷu, katchisiḷu, suli uyaġak atausiq unnii nuunniaġaat inaaniñ, qanuq puttuqsriŋaitkiksi God qaigaluaġman annautisukłusi."
2965," Then Jesus entered the temple courts and began to drive out those who were selling things there, ","Tavra Jesus isiŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, aasii anittaaqsivḷugich tamatkua tauqsiqsuqtuat, "
2966," saying to them, “It is written, ‘My house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have turned it into a den of robbers!” ","uqallautivlugich, Aglausimaruq Bible-ni God-im uqallautaa inna, “Uvaŋa igluqpaga taggisiqaġniaqtuq iñupayaat aŋaiyyuyaqtuġviannik.” Aglaalli ilivsi iriqtuġviḷiutiŋagiksi tigligayuktinun. "
2967," Jesus was teaching daily in the temple courts. The chief priests and the experts in the law and the prominent leaders among the people were seeking to assassinate him, ","Tavra Jesus iḷisaurriraqtuq uvlutuaġman aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi. Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik umialiŋnaŋisalu iñuich tuqutchukkaluaŋagaat, "

2969," Now one day, as Jesus was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the experts in the law with the elders came up ","Uvlut iḷaŋanni, Jesus iḷisaurripkaqtillugu iñuŋnik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi suli alġaqsruivḷuni tusaayugaaġiksuamik, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik, piqatigivlugich Jew-guruat umialiŋnaŋich ullaŋagaat Jesus.

2970," and said to him, “Tell us: By what authority are you doing these things? Or who it is who gave you this authority?” ","Aasii apiġivlugu, Uqallautitigut sum ataniġnaqutaagun tamatkua pivigich? Kia taavrumiŋa ataniġnaqusiqpatin tamatkua pitquvlugich? "

2972, John’s baptism – was it from heaven or from people?” ,"Kia ataniġnaqutiksriñŋavauŋ John paptaiqsiñiksraŋagun, God-im naagga iñuum? "
2973," So they discussed it with one another, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why did you not believe him?’ ","Tavra iliŋisa uqaaġutigiŋagaat taamna avanmun, Uqallakkupta God-miñ piñiḷugu, ilaa uqallagniaqtuq, Summan John ukpiġiŋaitpisiuŋ? "

2975, So they replied that they did not know where it came from. ,Tavra ilaisa kiuŋagaat nalunivḷutiŋ sumiñ pisilaaŋanik John paptaiqsiñiŋa. 
2976," Then Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by whose authority I do these things.”","Tavrali Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Uvaŋaptauq uqallautiyumiñaiñmigivsi kimun ataniġnaqutiksrisilaamnik tamatkuniŋa piyumiñaqsivḷuŋa."
2977," Then he began to tell the people this parable: “A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time. ","Tavra Jesus uqautirraqsiŋagai iñuich uumiŋa uuktuunmik, Iñuk nautchirriiruaq siiġñaqaġviŋmik, aasii atukkirrutigivlugu napaaqsiqirinun, aasii aullaqłuni allamun nunamun sivisuuraqtuami. "
2978," When harvest time came, he sent a slave to the tenants so that they would give him his portion of the crop. However, the tenants beat his slave and sent him away empty-handed. ","Tavra piviksraq tikiñman, ilaa tilisiŋaruq kivgamik napaaqsiqirinun, ilaiññun aitchuquvluni piksraunmiñik siiġñiaŋiññiñ.

2979," So he sent another slave. They beat this one too, treated him outrageously, and sent him away empty-handed. ","Tavra iñua siiġñaqaġvium tilisivsaaŋaruq allamik kivgamik. Taamnasuli anaumiŋagaat aŋalataġivlugulu kanŋunaqtuakun, aasii aullaqtiłługusuli aitchuġaluaġnagu. "
2980," So he sent still a third. They even wounded this one, and threw him out. ","Tilisivsaalgitchuq suli piŋatchiqł̣ugu, taamna anniaŋalgitkaat aniłługulu. "
2981," Then the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my one dear son; perhaps they will respect him.’ ","Tavra iñua siiġñaqaġvium uqallaŋaruq, Qanuġniaqpik uvaŋa? Tiliñiaġiga piviuttaġikkaġa iġñiġa. Nalupqinaitchuamik taluġiniaġaat. "
2982," But when the tenants saw him, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir; let’s kill him so the inheritance will be ours!’ ","Tavra napaaqsiqirit tautukamirruŋ, uqaqatigiiŋarut avanmun, Tamarra kiŋuvaannaktuksraun. Tuqullakput kiŋuvaannaktaaksraun uvagut pigiyumagikput."
2983, So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? ,"Tavra aninŋagaat siiġñaqaġviŋmiñ aasii tuqułługu. Tavraasii Jesus apiġiŋagai, Qanuq aasii piñiaqpa iñua siiġñaqaġvium napaaqsiqirinun? "
2984," He will come and destroy those tenants and give the vineyard to others.” When the people heard this, they said, “May this never happen!” ","Ilaan qaiḷuni tuqunniaġai taapkua napaaqsiqirit, aasii aitchuutigilugu siiġñaqaġvik allanun napaaqsiqirinun.

2985," But Jesus looked straight at them and said, “Then what is the meaning of that which is written: ‘The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone’? ","Tavra Jesus qiviaqługich iñuich uqallaŋaruq, Sunamiuvvauna aglausimava Bible-ni inna? “Kaŋiġalluŋmi uyaġagruaq, piitchuiññiqsrapiaq igluqpiñiġmi, taamna igluqpirit iginŋagaat.” "

2987," Then the experts in the law and the chief priests wanted to arrest him that very hour, because they realized he had told this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.","Tavra iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu tigutaaqsaġumaalliŋagaluaġaat Jesus tavrauvvaa, qanuq ilaisa puttuqsriŋagaat ilaan quliaqtuaġikkaŋa uuktuun inmiŋnun tuttiłługu, aglaan sivuuġagivlugich iñuich tiguŋaitkaat.

2988, Then they watched him carefully and sent spies who pretended to be sincere. They wanted to take advantage of what he might say so that they could deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor. ,"Tavra iliŋich nalautitchiiŋarut piviksramik.

2997, Now there were seven brothers. The first one married a woman and died without children. ,"Tavra tallimat malġuuŋarut aniqatigiich. Tavra aŋayukłiq nuliaŋaruq, aasii tuquvluni kiŋuvaaligaluaġnani. "
2998, The second ,"Tavra tugliata nuliaŋagaa, aasii tuquŋammiuq kiŋuvaaligaluaġnanisuli. "
2999," and then the third married her, and in this same way all seven died, leaving no children. ","Piŋayuak suli tuquŋammiuq. Tavra tallimat malġuk nuliaŋagaat, aasii kiŋuvaaliŋaitchut. "
3000, Finally the woman died too. ,Aqulliuvluni iluqaŋiññiñ aġnaq tuquŋammiuq. 
3001," In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife will the woman be? For all seven had married her.”","Tavra aŋŋiviŋmi, aŋikpata nalliata nuliaġiniaqpauŋ? Qanuq tallimat malġuk nuliaġiŋagaat."
3002," So Jesus said to them, “The people of this age marry and are given in marriage. ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Aŋutillu aġnallu katititchuurut mattumani nunami, "
3003, But those who are regarded as worthy to share in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage. ,"aglaan tamatkua nalliummatiruat aŋipkaqtauniġmun tuqqunmiñ, aasii iñuulutiŋ taimanigu katitinniaŋitchut. "
3004," In fact, they can no longer die, because they are equal to angels and are sons of God, since they are sons of the resurrection. ",Tuqutqikkumiñaitchut qanuq irrusiñiktut isaġuliktun. Suli iġñiġiliutiŋagai God-im qanuq aŋipkaqtauŋarut tuqqunmiñ. 
3005," But even Moses revealed that the dead are raised in the passage about the bush, where he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. ","Moses nalupqinaiqł̣ugu ukpiġnaqsiŋagaa tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtauniaġnivḷugich.

3006," Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live before him.” ","Ilaa God-auŋitchuq tuquŋaruanun, aglaan God-igigaat iñuuruat. Qanuq iluqaġmiŋ iñuurut ilaanun. "
3007," Then some of the experts in the law answered, “Teacher, you have spoken well!” ","Tavra Iḷaŋich iḷisaurrit pitquranik uqallaŋarut, Iḷisaurrii, Kiulluataġitin. "
3008, For they did not dare any longer to ask him anything.,Aasii iliŋich apiqsriyummataiŋarut ilaanun qanusipayaamik apiqqunmik.
3009," But he said to them, “How is it that they say that the Christ is David’s son? ","Tavra Jesus apiġiŋagai, Qanuġlutiŋ uqallausiġiyumiñaqparruŋ Christ iġñiġiniḷugu David-mun. "
3010," For David himself says in the book of Psalms, ","Qanuq David ilaa uqallaŋaruq makpiġaani Psalms-ni inna, “Ataniq uqallaŋaruq Atanimnun, Aquvittin taliqpiŋma tuŋaanun "
3011,"‘The Lord said to my lord, ",uumigiritin uvamnun akiiḷitchiaġilugich.”

3014," If David then calls him ‘Lord,’ how can he be his son?”","Qaunagisitchi iḷisaurriñiñ pitquranik kukiḷullaturuaniñ akuqturuanik annuġaaqaqłutiŋ, iḷisimatquvlutiŋ suutilaamiŋnik aasii iñupayaanun purvigitquvlutiŋ tauqsiqsuġviŋñi.

3016," “Beware of the experts in the law. They like walking around in long robes, and they love elaborate greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets. ",
3017," They devour widows’ property, and as a show make long prayers. They will receive a more severe punishment.”",
3018, Jesus looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the offering box. ,Jesus qiviaqłuni tautuŋagai suġalliruat iksriruat aitchuunmiŋnik aŋaiyyuvikpaum maniqaġvianun. 
3019, He also saw a poor widow put in two small copper coins. ,Suli tautuŋammigaa iḷiappauruaq uiḷgaŋaruaq iksriruaq malġugnik kannuyaŋnik maniuraŋnik. 
3020," He said, “I tell you the truth, this poor widow has put in more than all of them. ","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Iḷumun uqallautigivsi, una iḷiappauruaq uiḷgaŋaruaq ikisił̣hamaaqtuq iluqaiññiñ allaniñ iñuŋniñ. "
3021," For they all offered their gifts out of their wealth. But she, out of her poverty, put in everything she had to live on.”","Qanuq iluqaġmiŋ ikisiŋarut piukkaġniġmiŋniñ, aasii ilaa pisuksiuniġmiñiñ ikisiŋaruq iluqaanik pimiñik, iñuusautiksratualuŋmiñikunnii."
3022," Now while some were speaking about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and offerings, Jesus said, ","Tavra iñuich iḷaŋisa uqallausiġimmarruŋ aŋaiyyuvikpak, qanutun qiñiyunaġniŋa uyaġagruaġiksuanik aitchuutiniglu God-mun piqaqłuni, Jesus uqallaŋaruq, "

3026," And when you hear of wars and rebellions, do not be afraid. For these things must happen first, but the end will not come at once.”","Suli tusaaguvsi aŋuyaŋnik suli piallakłutiŋ sivuniksraiḷḷitchuanik, iqsiñasi, qanuq tamatkua piqqaaqtuksraurut, aglaan isuksraq tikiñŋaitchuq suli. "

3036, By your endurance you will gain your lives.,"Qapiġnasi suuramik-unnii, qanuq qapiŋitkuvsi, annautiniaġisi iñuggutisi."
3037," “But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation has come near. ","Tavraaglaan tautukkuvsiuŋ Jerusalem avanniqparruŋ aŋuyaich, tavrani iḷisimayumausi suksraunġiqsauniksraŋa qallisilaaŋanik. "
3038," Then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains. Those who are inside the city must depart. Those who are out in the country must not enter it, ","Tavraniasii tamatkua Judea-miittuat pigruġlich iġġiñun, suli tamatkua iniqpaŋmiittuat aullaġlutiŋ, suli tamatkua nunamiittuat isiġnagu iniqpak.

3039," because these are days of vengeance, to fulfill all that is written. ",Qanuq tavrani isagutiniaqtut tatavsausiaksraŋich iñuich nalautitchaġlugich iluqaisa Bible uqaluŋich. 
3040, Woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing their babies in those days!

3041, They will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away as captives among all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled. ,"Iñuich savikpaŋnik tuquġaġniaġaich, suli iñuich tigutaaqtaulutiŋ nunapayaani.

3044, Then they will see the Son of Man arriving in a cloud with power and great glory. ,Tavraniasiiñ tautugniaġaat Iġñiŋa iñuum qairuaq nuvuyakun suaŋŋatiqaġluni suli kamanaqtuamik qaumaniġmik. 
3045," But when these things begin to happen, stand up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near.” ","Tavra tamatkua piraġaaqsikpata, qiviaġitchi qunmun suli aaġluġlusi, qanuq annaurrauniksraqsi qalliruq."
3046, Then he told them a parable: “Look at the fig tree and all the other trees. ,"Tavra Jesus quliaqtuaġutiŋagai uuktuunmik. Tautuksiuŋ fig napaaqtua, iluqaisalu napaaqtut. "
3047," When they sprout leaves, you see for yourselves and know that summer is now near. ","Tavra tautukavsigik napaaqtut akutuqpaŋich nausaġataaqsimmata, iḷisimarusi upinġayasisilaaŋanik. "
3048," So also you, when you see these things happening, know that the kingdom of God is near. ","Tainnatuttauq, tautukkuvsigik tamatkua iqsiñaqtuat nalaurraqsikpata, iḷisimaniaqtusi God-im atanniqsimmataa qallisilaaŋanik."
3049," I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. ","Iḷumun uqallautigivsi, ukua iñuich tuquaniŋniaŋitchut iluqaisa tamatkua nalaunŋaunnagich. "
3050," Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away.","Qiḷaglu nunalu piiġñiaqtuk, aglaan uqalutka piiġñiaŋitchut."
3051," “But be on your guard so that your hearts are not weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and the worries of this life, and that day close down upon you suddenly like a trap.

3053," But stay alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that must happen, and to stand before the Son of Man.” ","Aglaan ilivsi quviqtaiḷiyumausi ataramik, aŋaiyyuuġlusi suaŋŋatiqaġuglusi pillukkumiñaġlugich sugaluaġnasi iluqaisa tamatkua piyumaaqtuat, suli makitayumiñaġuglusi sivuġaani Iġñiŋata iñuum. "
3054," So every day Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, but at night he went and stayed on the Mount of Olives. ","Tavra Jesus uvlutuaġman iḷisaurriŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, aasii unnuaġmagu unnuiyaqtuqłuni iġġimun atiqaqtuamun Olives-mik. "

3056," Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching. ","Niqinaqivik Puvlaksiŋaitchuamik Punniġmik qalliŋaruq, atiqaqtuaq Itqaunmik Qulaurrusiqiviŋmun. "
3057," The chief priests and the experts in the law were trying to find some way to execute Jesus, for they were afraid of the people.","Aasii aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik piviksraqsiuŋarut qanuġlugu tuqutchukługu Jesus, suiḷauriḷutiŋ sivuuġagivlugich iñuich."
3058," Then Satan entered Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was one of the twelve. ","Tavra Satan isiŋaruq Judas-mun taggisiqaqtuamun Iscariot-mik, iḷauruaq qulit malġuŋnun iḷitchitquranun. "
3059," He went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he might betray Jesus, handing him over to them. ","Ilaa aullaŋaruq aasii uqaqatigiaqsivḷugich aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu atanauraŋiḷḷu aŋaiyyuvikpaum munaqsriŋisa, qanuġlugu aitchuutigisukługu Jesus iliŋiññun. "
3060, They were delighted and arranged to give him money. ,"Tavra iliŋich quyatchaŋarut, suli aitchuġuŋagaat maniŋñik. "
3061, So Judas agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus when no crowd was present.,"Tavra Judas aŋiŋammiuq, aasii piviksraqsiugaqsivḷuni aitchuutigisukługu Jesus ilaiññun iñuich quviġlugich."
3062," Then the day for the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb had to be sacrificed. ","Tavra tikiñŋaruq uvlua Puvlaksiŋaitchuam Punniġum, taamna qulaurrusiqutim imnaiyaam tuqutauviksraŋa. "
3063," Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us to eat.” ","Tavra Jesus tiliŋagik Peter-lu John-lu uqallakłuni, Aullaġlutik itqanaiyautiyaqtuqtigut qulaurrusiqinikun niġiyumaugut. "

3065," He said to them, “Listen, when you have entered the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house that he enters, ","Ilaan kiuŋagik, Naalaġnisitchik. Aullaġitchik iniqpaŋmun, aasii paaġniaġaatik iñuum saagaqtuam qattamun imiġmik. Malikkumagiktik, "

3067, Then he will show you a large furnished room upstairs. Make preparations there.” ,Tavra iḷisautiniaġaatik inituruamik qiḷaguamik upaluŋaitchuamik. Tavrani itqanaiyautiyumagiptigut.

3069," Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table and the apostles joined him. ","Tavra ikarraq tikiñman, Jesus aquvinŋaruq niġġiviŋñun piqatigivlugich tilirat iḷitchitqurani. "
3070," And he said to them, “I have earnestly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer. ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Piyummatigipiallakługu niġiqatigiyumaŋagivsi uumiŋa Qulaurrusiqunmik nagliksaaŋaiñŋaġma. "

3074," Then he took bread, and after giving thanks he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” ","Jesus tiguŋagaa punniq, aasii quyaanikami God-mun, aviŋagaa aitchuutigivlugu ilaiññun uqallakłuni, Tavra taamna timiga aitchuutauruaq ilivsiññun.

3085," that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ","aasii niġiñiaqtusi imiġlusiḷu niġġivimñi atanniqsimavimñi, suli aquppiḷusi umialgich aquppiutaŋiññi isivġiġḷugich qulit malġuk maŋŋuġiich Israel-guruat."

"
3093," So they said, “Look, Lord, here are two swords.” Then he told them, “It is enough.”","Tavra iḷitchitqurat uqallaŋarut, Tautugiñ Ataniiq, uvva malġuk savikpaak. Ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Naamaruk."
3094," Then Jesus went out and made his way, as he customarily did, to the Mount of Olives, and the disciples followed him. ","Tavra Jesus aniŋaruq, aasii aullaqłuni piḷġusikaamisun iġġimun atiqaqtuamun Olives-mik. Iḷitchitqurat maliŋammigaat. "
3095," When he came to the place, he said to them, “Pray that you will not fall into temptation.” ","Tavra tikiññami inimun ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Aŋaiyyusitchi payaritquŋiḷḷusi ikł̣igutchaktinniaġunmun. "
3096," He went away from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed, ","Tavra ilaa taikuŋaqtaallavsaaŋaruq iliŋiññiñ uyaġaŋmik miḷuqsalgutilaavalliqsun, aasii sitquqłuni aŋaiyyuŋaruq. "

3098, Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him. ,Tavra tavrani isaġulik qiḷaŋmiñ niptaŋaruq ilaanun aasii suaŋŋasiqł̣ugu. 
3099," And in his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat was like drops of blood falling to the ground.] ","Aasii iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaqaqłuni ilaa aŋaiyyuŋaruq qapiŋaipiaġataqłuni, suli ilaan siiqsipkaġniŋa kutaaŋaruq nunamun auktun kusiqsuatun. "
3100," When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, exhausted from grief. ","Tavra makinnami aŋaiyyuŋaiqł̣uni, ilaan ullaŋagai iḷitchitqurat suli tautuŋagai siñiktuat, isumaaqpaił̣ł̣utiŋ. "
3101," So he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you will not fall into temptation!”","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Summan siñikpisi? Makillusi aŋaiyyusitchi payariŋitchumagaasi ikł̣igutchaktinniaġutim."
3102," While he was still speaking, suddenly a crowd appeared, and the man named Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them. He walked up to Jesus to kiss him. ","Tavra Jesus uqaġniaqtillugusuli, iñusalaich qaiŋarut, suli taamna Judas-mik atilik, iḷaŋat qulit malġuk iḷitchitqurat, aullarrivḷuni iliŋiññik. Ilaan ullaŋagaa Jesus kunigiaqługu. "

3104," When those who were around him saw what was about to happen, they said, “Lord, should we use our swords?” ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat avataaniittuat Jesus, iḷitchuġikamiŋ suna piaqsisilaaŋanik, uqallaŋarut, Ataniiq, savikpagaġniaqpisa? "
3105," Then one of them struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. ","Tavra iḷaŋata anauŋagaa aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaum kivgaŋa, aasii siutaiqł̣ugu taliqpianik. "
3106," But Jesus said, “Enough of this!” And he touched the man’s ear and healed him. ","Tavra Jesus iñiqtiŋagai, Tavraaġitchi. Aasii ilaan aksiuŋagaa siutaa iłuaqsivḷugu."
3107," Then Jesus said to the chief priests, the officers of the temple guard, and the elders who had come out to get him, “Have you come out with swords and clubs like you would against an outlaw? ","Tavra Jesus uqallaŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun atanauraŋiññullu aŋaiyyuvikpaum munaqsriŋisa umialiŋnanullu tiguriyaqtuqtuanun inmiñik, Qaiŋavisi tigligayuktimik pisaġmatun, savikpaŋnik anauttaniglu satkuqaqłusi tigusaqtuqłuŋa?

3108," Day after day when I was with you in the temple courts, you did not arrest me. But this is your hour, and that of the power of darkness!”","Nayuqtigiraġikavsi uvlumiñ uvlumun aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi tigulaitkivsiŋa. Aglaan piviksraqsi nalautittuq, taavrumalu suaŋŋataata taaqtuam."
3109," Then they arrested Jesus, led him away, and brought him into the high priest’s house. But Peter was following at a distance. ",Tavra ilaisa tigutaaŋagaat Jesus suli aullautivlugu aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaum igluanun. Peter maliġuaŋaruq aquatigun uŋasikł̣uni. 
3110," When they had made a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat down among them. ","Tavraasii igniqsuaniŋmata qitqanun siḷalliata kasimavium suli aquptaaqłutiŋ atautchimun, Peter aquvinŋammiuq akunġannun. "
3111," Then a slave girl, seeing him as he sat in the firelight, stared at him and said, “This man was with him too!” ","Tavrani niviaqsiam kivgam, tautukługu Peter aquppipkaqtillugu igniġum qaummaŋani uqallaŋaruq, Una iñuk tuvaaqatauŋammiruaq Jesus-mun. "
3112," But Peter denied it: “Woman, I don’t know him!” ","Tavra Peter-m piiḷaaġiŋagaa taamna uqallakłuni, Aġnaaq, ilaa uvaŋa nalugiga. "
3113," Then a little later someone else saw him and said, “You are one of them too.” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!” ","Akkuliurallaksiññaġman iñuum tamaaŋŋa tautulgitkaa Peter aasii uqallakłuni, Ilivich uvva iḷagimmigaatin. Tavra Peter uqallaŋaruq, Aŋuun, iḷagiŋitkaanŋa. "
3114," And after about an hour still another insisted, “Certainly this man was with him, because he too is a Galilean.” ","Taavruma aquagun ikarraq pianikpalliġman, allasuli iñuk katchuŋaiqsruqłuni uqallaŋaruq, Nalupqinaitchuamik una iñuk piqatauŋaruq Jesus-mun qanuq Galilee-ġmiugummiuq. "
3115," But Peter said, “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking about!” At that moment, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed. ","Tavra Peter uqallaŋaruq, Aŋuun, naluruŋa sumik uqautiqaqtilaaġnik. Tavra tavrauvvaa, uqaġniaqtillugusuli, tiŋmiaq nipanŋaruq. "
3116," Then the Lord turned and looked straight at Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said to him, “Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times.” ","Aasiisuli Ataniq qiviaqłuni qiñiŋagaa Peter.

3117, And he went outside and wept bitterly.,Tavra Peter aniŋaruq aasii qiapiaġataŋaruq.
3118, Now the men who were holding Jesus under guard began to mock him and beat him. ,Tavra taapkua munaqsriruat Jesus-mik kipagiŋagaat anaullaqługu. 
3119," They blindfolded him and asked him repeatedly, “Prophesy! Who hit you?” ","Suli irrak mattutchiqł̣ugik apiġiraġaŋagaat, Kia qakiqpatin? Nalautchaġiñ. "
3120," They also said many other things against him, reviling him.",Suli iliŋich uqallaŋarut iñugiaktuanik uqaluŋnik pisaaŋavlugu uqamaqłuutivlugulu.
3121," When day came, the council of the elders of the people gathered together, both the chief priests and the experts in the law. Then they led Jesus away to their council ","Tavra uvluġman, umialiŋnaŋich Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik katinŋarut atautchimun, aasii qaġġisiŋagaat Jesus uqaqsitaaġviŋmiŋnun. "
3122," and said, “If you are the Christ, tell us.” But he said to them, “If I tell you, you will not believe, ","Apiġiŋagaat, Ilivich Christ-guvich? Uqallautitigut. Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Uqallautigaluaġuvsi ukpiġiniaŋitkivsiŋa. "
3123," and if I ask you, you will not answer. ","Suli apiġigaluaġmiguvsi kiummagaaġma, kiuniaŋiñmigivsiŋa nalaunŋaruamik. "
3124, But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the power of God.” ,Aglaan paŋmapaŋmiñ Iġñiŋa iñuum aquppiutchiqsauniaqtuq taliqpiata tuŋaanun Sapiġñaqtuam God-im. 
3125," So they all said, “Are you the Son of God, then?” He answered them, “You say that I am.” ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ uqallaŋarut, Uvvailivich Iġñiġivatin God-im? Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Uqallaktusi Iġñiġinivḷuŋa. "
3126," Then they said, “Why do we need further testimony? We have heard it ourselves from his own lips!”","Tavra iliŋich uqallaŋarut, Iñuvsaanik pasiññiktuksranik ilaanik piqaqtuksrauŋaiqsugut. Uvagut paŋmapak tusaaganikkivut ilaan uqaluŋi Iġñiġinivḷuni God-mun."
3127, Then the whole group of them rose up and brought Jesus before Pilate. ,"Tavra iluqaġmiŋ piqatigiich makinŋarut, aasii qaġġisivlugu Jesus Pilate-mun. "
3128," They began to accuse him, saying, “We found this man subverting our nation, forbidding us to pay the tribute tax to Caesar and claiming that he himself is Christ, a king.” ","Tavra iliŋisa uqautigirraqsiŋagaat uqaqłutiŋ, Iḷitchuġigikput una iñuk asiñuurriñiaqtuaguvlugu iñuptiŋnik, suli aitchuitquriŋił̣ł̣uni akiḷiutinik taxes-nik Caesar-mun, uqaqłuni ilaa Christ-gunivḷuni umialik.

3129," So Pilate asked Jesus, “Are you the king of the Jews?” He replied, “You say so.” ","Tavra Pilate-gum apiġiŋagaa Jesus, Umialigivatin Jew-guruat? Tavra ilaan kiuŋagaa, Tainna uqallaktutin. "
3130," Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I find no basis for an accusation against this man.” ","Tavra Pilate uqallaŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun iñusalaŋnullu, Patchisiksramik iḷitchuġiŋitchuŋa uumani iñuŋmi. "
3131," But they persisted in saying, “He incites the people by teaching throughout all Judea. It started in Galilee and ended up here!”","Tavra iliŋich katchuŋaiñŋarut uqaqłutiŋ, Ilaan aŋalayyauġai iñuich, iḷisaurrivḷuni iluqaani Judea-mi, Galilee-miñqaŋa uumuŋaaglaan inimun."
3132," Now when Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean. ","Tavra Pilate taamna tusaakamiuŋ, apiqsriŋaruq iñuk taamna Galilee-ġmiugummagaan. "
3133," When he learned that he was from Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him over to Herod, who also happened to be in Jerusalem at that time. ","Tavra Pilate iḷitchuġikami Jesus Herod atanniqsimakkaŋani inniġman, ilaan Herod-muktinŋagaa, Herod Jerusalem-miinmimman taavrumani piviksrami. "
3134," When Herod saw Jesus, he was very glad, for he had long desired to see him, because he had heard about him and was hoping to see him perform some miraculous sign. ","Tavra Herod tautukamiuŋ Jesus, ilaa quyapiaġataŋaruq, qanuq sivisuruami tautugumalaaŋavlugu, pisigivlugich tusaasuukkani ilaagun, suli tautugumaŋagaluaqtuq qanutchimik aliuġnaqtuamik savakpan. "
3135, So Herod questioned him at considerable length; Jesus gave him no answer. ,"Tavra Herod-gum sivisuuraqtuami apiqsruqtuŋagaa Jesus, aglaan ilaan kiulaiñŋagaa. "
3136," The chief priests and the experts in the law were there, vehemently accusing him. ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik makitaruat tamaani, suammakłutiŋ saŋunŋagaat Jesus. "
3137," Even Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt and mocked him. Then, dressing him in elegant clothes, Herod sent him back to Pilate. ","Tavra Herod-gum aŋuyaktiŋisalu aŋalataġiŋagaat pisaaŋŋatikun kipagivlugulu, kiisaimma annuġaalgitpaat annuġaaġipiaġataqtuanik umialiktun, aasii utiqtiłługu Pilate-mun. "
3138," That very day Herod and Pilate became friends with each other, for prior to this they had been enemies.","Tavraasii Herod-lu Pilate-lu avilaitqatigiiksinŋaruk avanmun taavrumanipiallak uvlumi, qanuq sivuani taavruma uumikkutiŋagaluaqtuak avanmun."
3139," Then Pilate called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people, ","Pilate tavrani ququaŋagai atautchimun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu umialiŋnallu iñuiḷḷu, "
3140," and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people. When I examined him before you, I did not find this man guilty of anything you accused him of doing.

3142, I will therefore have him flogged and release him.”,Tavra ipiġaqtuqtisiññaġniaġiga aasii tigutaaqtauŋaiqsillugu.

3145, Pilate addressed them once again because he wanted to release Jesus. ,Barabbas tigutaaqtauruaq pisigivlugu tuavaallaktitchiŋaniŋa iniqpaŋmi iñuaqłuniḷu. 
3146," But they kept on shouting, “Crucify, crucify him!” ","Pilate-gum nivliutitqikkalualgitkai atausivsaami, kipiġniuġaluaqłuni tigutaaqtauŋaiqsitchukługu Jesus. "
3147," A third time he said to them, “Why? What wrong has he done? I have found him guilty of no crime deserving death. I will therefore flog him and release him.” ","Tavra iliŋich saqłarraqsigiññaŋarut, Kikiaktuutili, kikiaktuutili aŋarrauramun. "
3148," But they were insistent, demanding with loud shouts that he be crucified. And their shouts prevailed. ","Piŋayuaŋni Pilate-gum uqallautigalualgitkai, Summan? Sumik pigiitchuamik piŋava?

3151," As they led him away, they seized Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country. They placed the cross on his back and made him carry it behind Jesus.

3154," For this is certain: The days are coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore children, and the breasts that never nursed!’ ","Tavra Jesus kiŋiaqługich uqallautiŋagai, Aġnaat Jerusalem-mi, qirratigiŋaiqsiŋa uvaŋa.

3157, Two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him. ,"Qanuq tainna pikparruŋ iñuk patchisaitchuaq paŋmapak, qanutun piñiaġmivat iñuŋnun taimanigu?"
3158," So when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” they crucified him there, along with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left. ","Malġuktauq allak, pitquranik kamaksriŋitchuaq, tuqutauruksraġuŋammigaich piqatigilugu Jesus. "

3185," All things were created by him, and apart from him not one thing was created that has been created. ","aasii taavrumuuna Uqalukun God-im savaŋagai supayaat, suli atausiuraq-unnii savaaguŋaruaq savaaguŋaitchuq ilaa piiḷḷugu. "
3186," In him was life, and the life was the light of mankind. ","Uqaluŋmiñ kaŋiqaŋaruq iñuggun, aasii taavruma iñuggutim qaġġirrigai iñuich qaummaġmik, iḷisautivlugich God-im iḷumun ittuaŋanik. "
3187," And the light shines on in the darkness, but the darkness has not mastered it.","Qaummaqtun qaummaġiksuatun taaqtuami, suli taaqtuam qamilaiñmatun qaummaq, ilaalli iḷisautiŋagai iñuich God-im iḷumun ittuaŋanik aasii tamatkua akiḷḷiḷiqsuutiruat ilaanun payariŋaitkaat ilaa."
3188," A man came, sent from God, whose name was John. ",Iñuqaŋaruq atiqaqtuamik John-mik tiliŋaraanik God-im. 
3189," He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that everyone might believe through him. ","John qaiŋaruq quliaqtuaġiyaqtuqługu ilaa taamna qaummaqtun ittuaq, iñuich iluqaġmiŋ ukpiquvlugich. "
3190," He himself was not the light, but he came to testify about the light. ","John taamnauŋaitchuq qaummaqtun ittuatun, aglaan qaiŋaruq quliaqtuaġisukługu taamna qaummaqtun ittuaq, "
3191," The true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. ","iḷisaurriruaq iḷumun ittuamik, qaigaqsiruaq nunamun qaġġirriḷuni qaummaġmik iñupayaanun."
3192," He was in the world, and the world was created by him, but the world did not recognize him. ","Ilaa nunamiinŋaruq, ilaan savaŋagaa nuna, aasiiḷi nunapayaat naluŋagaat. "
3193," He came to what was his own, but his own people did not receive him. ","Ilaa qaiŋaruq pimiñun, aasii nanmiñiq iñuŋisa akuqtuŋaitkaat. "
3194, But to all who have received him – those who believe in his name – he has given the right to become God’s children ,"Aglaan iluqaisa akuqtuqtini ukpiqtuat inmiñun, ilaan miqłiqtuliutipkaŋagai God-mun. "
3195," – children not born by human parents or by human desire or a husband’s decision, but by God.","Tamatkua aniŋaitchut iñugruiññaum aniñiŋa tuvraġlugu, naaggaunnii pisuutaa iñuum. Iliŋich anitqiŋarut pisuutaagun God-im."
3196," Now the Word became flesh and took up residence among us. We saw his glory – the glory of the one and only, full of grace and truth, who came from the Father. ","Tavra taamna taggisiqaqtuaq Uqaluŋmik iñuġuŋaruq aasii iñuuqataullakłuni uvaptiŋni, naamaruamik nagliktuutiqpaqaqłuni iḷumun ittuaguvluniḷu. Uvagut tautuŋagikput kamanautaa, kamanaun kisimisualuk Iġñitualuuruam Aapamun pigikkaŋa. "
3197," John testified about him and shouted out, “This one was the one about whom I said, ‘He who comes after me is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’” ","John quliaqtuaqaŋaruq ilaanik, suli nipatuvluni uqaqłuni, Uvva taimña quliaqtuaġiŋaraġa, iñuk qairuaq aqupkun kamanałhaaqtuq uvamniñ, qanuq sivumni inŋaruq."
3198, For we have all received from his fullness one gracious gift after another. ,"Suli naammataaniñ ilaan nagliktuutiqpaŋmi, nagliktuġayukkaatigut iluqata, aitchuqtuaqłuta nagliktuutinik maligiikł̣ugich. "
3199," For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ. ","God-im qaiñŋagai pitqurat Moses-kun, aglaalli nagliktuutiqpak iḷumun ittuaġlu qaisauŋaruk Jesus Christ-kun. "
3200," No one has ever seen God. The only one, himself God, who is in closest fellowship with the Father, has made God known.","Kialiqaa tautuŋaitkaa God qaŋaunnii, aglaan Iġñitualuum piviuttaġitchiqsuam Aapamiñ iḷitchuġipkaŋagaa."
3201," Now this was John’s testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” ",Uvvali uqaluktuaŋi John. Jew-guruat tilisiŋarut aŋaiyyuliqsimiŋnik Levi-ñiglu Jerusalem-miñ apiqsruġiaqługu kiummagaan. 
3202, He confessed – he did not deny but confessed – “I am not the Christ!” ,"John-gum kiuŋagai nalupqinaiqł̣ugu, Uvaŋa Christ-guŋitchuŋa. "
3203," So they asked him, “Then who are you? Are you Elijah?” He said, “I am not!” “Are you the Prophet?” He answered, “No!” ","Tavra apiġiŋagaat, Kiuviñmi? Elijah-uvich? Ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Elijah-uŋitchuŋa. Uqaqtauvich God-mun Moses-tun itchumaaqtuaq? Ilaan kiuŋagai, Naagga. "
3204," Then they said to him, “Who are you? Tell us so that we can give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?”","Ilaisa apiġiŋagaat, Kiuviñmi? Kiggutiksraqaġumaugut tilisiruanun uvaptiŋnik. Qanuq uqallausiġiyumiñaqpich ilipkun? "
3205," John said, “I am the voice of one shouting in the wilderness, ‘Make straight the way for the Lord,’ as Isaiah the prophet said.” ","Ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Uvaŋa nipatuvluŋa uqaqtuŋa nunagluktuami, uqaluatun Isaiah-m God-im uqaqtaata uqallaŋamman, “Sivukkiksaqsiuŋ apqutaa Atanġum.”"
3206, (Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.) ,Taapkua apiqsruqtuiruat John-mik tilirauŋaniqsut Pharisee-ñiñ. 
3207," So they asked John, “Why then are you baptizing if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?”","Ilaisa apiġiŋagaat, Christ-guŋitkuvich, naaggaunnii Elijah-uŋitkuvich, naagga taimñauŋitkuvich uqaqtaa God-im, summan paptaiqsivich? "
3208," John answered them, “I baptize with water. Among you stands one whom you do not recognize, ","John kiuŋagai, Uvaŋa paptaiġutiqaqtuŋa imiġmik. Akunnavsiññi imma makitaruq nalukkaqsi, "
3209, who is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandal!” ,"taimña qaiyumaaqtuaq aqupkun, aasii nalliummatiŋitchuŋa siŋiiġumiñaġlugik unnii siŋiŋik aluġutiŋikta. "
3210, These things happened in Bethany across the Jordan River where John was baptizing.,"Tamatkua piŋarut Bethany-mi Perea-mi taavanitchiani Jordan, John paptaiqsiviani."
3211," On the next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, “Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! ","Uvlutqiŋman John-gum tautuŋagaa Jesus qairuaq tuŋimiñun, aasii uqallaŋaruq, Avva, Imnaiyaaŋa God-im piiqsiruaq piḷuutiŋiññik nunam iñuŋisa. "
3212," This is the one about whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who is greater than I am, because he existed before me.’ ","Taavva taimña uqallausiġiŋaraġa, aqupkun iñuk qaiñiaqtuq kamanałhaaqtuaq uvamniñ, qanuq aniŋaiñŋaġma sivumni inŋaruq. "
3213," I did not recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he could be revealed to Israel.”","Naluŋagaluaġiga uvaŋaġruiññaq kisuutilaaŋanik taimña iñuk, naaggauvva tilirauŋaruŋa paptaiġutiqaquvluŋa imiġmik iḷitchuġipkaquvlugu Israel-guruanun kisuutilaaŋanik. "
3214," Then John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained on him. ","Tavra John quliaqtuaŋaruq uqaqłuni, Tautuŋagiga Ilitqusiġiksuaq atqaqtuaq tiŋmiatun qiḷaŋmiñ, aasii ilaaniiłłuni. "
3215," And I did not recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘The one on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining – this is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ ","Taamna piŋaiñŋaan, naluŋagaluaġiga kisuutilaaŋa, aglaan God-im tilisiruam uvamnik paptaiqsitquvluŋa paptaiġutiqaġluŋa imiġmik uqallautiŋagaaŋa, Iñuk tautukkupku Ilitqusiġiksuam atqaġvigikpagu aasii nayuġlugu, taamnauruq iḷisiñiaqtuaq Ilitqusiġiksuamik iḷuvsiññun.

3216, I have both seen and testified that this man is the Chosen One of God.”,Aasii tautuŋavlugu quliaqtuaġigiga ilaa Iġñiġinivḷugu God-mun.
3217, Again the next day John was standing there with two of his disciples. ,"Uvlaakumman John makitaqatigiŋagik iḷitchitquraŋni, "
3218," Gazing at Jesus as he walked by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!” ","aasii qiñiqługu Jesus pisuaqtillugu uqallaŋaruq, Avva God-im Imnaiyaaŋa. "
3219," When John’s two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. ","Iḷitchitqurak tusaaŋagaak taamna uqallausiġimmagu, aasii maliŋagaak Jesus. "
3220," Jesus turned around and saw them following and said to them, “What do you want?” So they said to him, “Rabbi” (which is translated Teacher), “where are you staying?” ","Jesus kiŋiaqłuni tautuŋagik maliktuak, aasii uqallautiŋagik, Suvisik? Iliŋikta apiġiŋagaak, Rabbi, (sivuniqaqtuaq Iḷisaurrii), sumi iniqaqpich? "
3221," Jesus answered, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day. Now it was about four o’clock in the afternoon.","Ilaan uqallautiŋagik, Qaiḷutik tautugiatku. Tavra tautugiaŋagaak sumi iniqaqtilaaŋa, aasii nayuŋagaak taavrumani uvlumi, qanuq sisamanukpalliqł̣uni."
3222," Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two disciples who heard what John said and followed Jesus. ","Andrew, Simon Peter-m aniqataa igḷuuŋaruq maliktuamun Jesus-mik tusaaqqaaqługu John uqallaŋman. "
3223," He first found his own brother Simon and told him, “We have found the Messiah!” (which is translated Christ). ","Ilaan paqitqaaŋagaa aniqatini Simon, aasii uqallautivlugu, Paqinŋagikput Messiah (sivuniqaqtuaq Christ-mik). "
3224," Andrew brought Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, “You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated Peter).","Ilaan qaġġisiŋagaa Jesus-mun. Jesus qiñiqługu uqallautiŋagaa, Simon-gurutin, iġñiŋa John. Tavraŋŋaaglaan atiqaġniaqtutin Cephas-mik (sivuniqaqtuamik Peter-mik Uyaġagmiglu)."
3225," On the next day Jesus wanted to set out for Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, “Follow me.” ","Uvlaakumman Jesus sivunniŋaruq Galilee-mugukłuni. Paqiłługu Philip uqallautiŋagaa, Maliŋŋa. "
3226," (Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrew and Peter.) ","Philip Bethsaida-ġmiuguŋaniqsuq, iniqpaŋmi Andrew-vlu Peter-vlu iñuuviaŋni. "
3227," Philip found Nathanael and told him, “We have found the one Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets also wrote about – Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.” ","Tavra Philip paqinŋagaa Nathanael, aasii uqallautivlugu, Paqinŋagikput iñuk Moses-gum pitqurani uqaqtiŋisalu God-im aglautiŋaraat.

3228," Nathanael replied, “Can anything good come out of Nazareth?” Philip replied, “Come and see.”","Nathanael-gum uqallautiŋagaa, Sunapayaaq nakuuruaq qaiyumiñaqpa Nazareth-miñ? Philip-gum kiuŋagaa, Qaiḷutin tautugiaġuŋ."
3229," Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him and exclaimed, “Look, a true Israelite in whom there is no deceit!” ","Jesus tautukamiuŋ Nathanael ullautiruaq inmiñun, uqallautiŋagaa, Uvva Israel-miupiaġataq, inmiñi sagluqqutaitchuaq. "
3230," Nathanael asked him, “How do you know me?” Jesus replied, “Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.” ","Nathanael-gum uqallautiŋagaa Jesus, Qanuqłutin iḷisimaviŋa? Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Philip-mun qaitquŋaiñŋaqpich tautuŋagikpiñ ataaniitillutin fig napaaqtuata. "
3231," Nathanael answered him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel!” ","Nathanael-gum kiuŋagaa, Rabbi, Iġñiġigaatin God-im. Umialigigaatin Israel-guruat. "
3232," Jesus said to him, “Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.” ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Uvva uqallautikapkiñ tautugnivḷutin fig napaaqtuata ataani ukpiliqpich? Tautukkumaaqtutin kamanałhaaqtuanik taavsrumaŋŋa. "
3233," He continued, “I tell all of you the solemn truth – you will see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man.”","Suli Jesus uqallautivsaaŋagaa, Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigikpiñ, tautugniaġiñ qiḷak aŋmaqtuaq, suli God-im isaġuliŋi mayuqtuat atqaqtuallu Iġñiŋanun Iñuum."
3234," Now on the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there, ","Tavra uvluk piŋayuaŋni katirrusiqiŋarut nunaaqqimi Cana-mi Galilee-miittuami, aasii Jesus aakaŋa tavraniinŋaruq. "
3235, and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the wedding. ,Jesus-tauq iḷitchitquraniḷu aiyugaaqtauŋammiut katirrusiqiruanun. 
3236," When the wine ran out, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no wine left.” ",Tavra wine nuŋumman Jesus aakaŋata uqallautiŋagaa wine-gutaiġñivḷugich. 
3237," Jesus replied, “Woman, why are you saying this to me? My time has not yet come.” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Aġnaaq uŋiarrisigikkan uvaŋa uŋiarrisaġiŋitkiga. Ikarraġa tikiñŋaitchuqsuli. "
3238," His mother told the servants, “Whatever he tells you, do it.”","Aakaŋa uqallaŋaruq kivganun, Pisitchi qanupayaaq pitqukpasi."
3239," Now there were six stone water jars there for Jewish ceremonial washing, each holding twenty or thirty gallons. ",Tavra itchaksrat uyaġaich qattat tavrani inŋarut. Atausiq immaqtutilaaqallaavluni 20 naagga 30 gallon-tulluunnii. Aasii taapkua qattat imaŋich atuġuuruat Jew-guruat piraġausiannun salummaqtauniġmi. 
3240," Jesus told the servants, “Fill the water jars with water.” So they filled them up to the very top. ","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Immiqsigik qattat imiġmik. Tavra immiŋagaich qaqłuqpiuraqługich. "
3241," Then he told them, “Now draw some out and take it to the head steward,” and they did. ","Suli uqallautiŋagai, Qalusiñaqsigaasi aasii qaiḷḷugu qaukłiannun niqłiqirit. Tavra aanŋagaat ilaanun. "
3242," When the head steward tasted the water that had been turned to wine, not knowing where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called the bridegroom ","Niqinaqiruani niqłiqirit qaukłiata uukamiuŋ wine-ġuqtitauruaq naluŋaniqsuq sumiñ pisilaaŋanik, kivgat aglaan imiqtaŋaruat iḷisimagaluaqtut. Niqłiqirit qaukłiata niqinaqiruani ququaŋagaa uiksraun "
3243," and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the cheaper wine when the guests are drunk. You have kept the good wine until now!” ","aasii uqallautivlugu, Iñupayaam sivulliġisuugaa nakuuruaq wine aasii iñuich imianiŋmata iḷaŋaniñ, kiŋummuuruaq wine pivaallukługu, aglaan uvva tutquqtaġiniġiñ nakuuruaq wine paŋmapaŋmun aglaan. "
3244," Jesus did this as the first of his miraculous signs, in Cana of Galilee. In this way he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.","Taamna aliuġnaqtuaq Jesus pikkaŋa Cana-mi Galilee-miittuami sivulliuŋaruq nalupqinaiyautinun kamanautiqaqtilaaŋanun, aasii iḷitchitquraŋi ukpiliŋarut ilaanun."
3245," After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother and brothers and his disciples, and they stayed there a few days. ","Taavsruma aquagun Jesus aullaŋaruq Capernaum-mun, piqatigivlugich aakaniḷu aniqatiiniḷu iḷitchitquraniḷu, aasii tavrani uvliuqtuallaŋarut."
3246," Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, so Jesus went up to Jerusalem.","Tavra Itqaivik Qulaurrusiqiviannik Jew-guruat tikiñŋaruq, aasii Jesus aullaŋaruq Jerusalem-mun. "
3247," He found in the temple courts those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money changers sitting at tables. ","Aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi paqinŋagai iñuich tuniuqqairuat immuliviich aŋusalluŋiññik imnaiñiglu tiŋmianiglu, suli simmiqsuqtit maniŋñik aquppiruat inimiŋni. "
3248," So he made a whip of cords and drove them all out of the temple courts, with the sheep and the oxen. He scattered the coins of the money changers and overturned their tables. ","Tavra ipiġaqtuusivḷuni akłunaamik uŋuraŋagai iluqaisa aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmiñ, iñuiḷḷu imnaiḷḷu immuliviiḷḷu aŋusalluŋich, suli naavinŋagai simmiqsuqtit maniŋich ulġuuqługiḷḷu aglagviŋich. "
3249," To those who sold the doves he said, “Take these things away from here! Do not make my Father’s house a marketplace!” ","Suli uqallautiŋagai tamatkua tuniuqqairuat tiŋmianik, Aullautisigik tamatkua, tauqsiqsuġviġuġniaŋitkiksi Aapama iglua. "
3250," His disciples remembered that it was written, “Zeal for your house will devour me.”","Iḷitchitquraŋi itqaŋarut aglaaguŋaruamik Bible-ni, “Siġñiksrautiqpaum igluŋnun God payarigaaŋa.”"
3251," So then the Jewish leaders responded, “What sign can you show us, since you are doing these things?” ","Tavra Jew-guruat apiġiniqłaŋagaat, Sumik aliuġnaqtuamik piyumiñaqpich nalupqinaiyautiksraġnik ataniġnaqutiqaqtilaaġnik tainna piyumiñaqłutin. "
3252," Jesus replied, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up again.” ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Suksraunġiqsiuŋ una aŋaiyyuvikpak aasii uvluni piŋasuni nappatqigñiaġiga. "
3253," Then the Jewish leaders said to him, “This temple has been under construction for forty-six years, and are you going to raise it up in three days?” ","Tavra Jew-guruat uqallaŋarut, 46 ukiuni savaaguŋaruq una aŋaiyyuvikpak, aasii ilivich piŋasuni uvluni nappaġniaqpiuŋ?"
3254, But Jesus was speaking about the temple of his body. ,Ilaan uqautigikamiuŋ aŋaiyyuvikpak sivuniġiŋagaa ilaan timini. 
3255," So after he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they believed the scripture and the saying that Jesus had spoken.","Tavra aŋipkaqtauganiŋman tuqqunmiñ, iḷitchitquraŋisa itqaŋagaat taamna uqallautaa, aasii ukpiġiŋagaat Bible uqaluat uqaluiḷḷu Jesus uqausiġiŋaraŋi."
3256," Now while Jesus was in Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover, many people believed in his name because they saw the miraculous signs he was doing. ","Tavra ilaa Jerusalem-miinman Itqautaanni Qulaurrusiqiviŋmun niqinaqiviŋmi, iñugiaktuat ukpiŋarut ilaanun tautukamisigik aliuġnaqtuat pikkaŋi nalupqinaiyautit kiutilaaŋanun. "
3257," But Jesus would not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people. ","Tavra Jesus ukpiġiŋaitkai ukpipiaġniḷugich inmiñun, qanuq iḷisimaŋagai iñupayaat. "
3258," He did not need anyone to testify about man, for he knew what was in man.","Iñuŋmik uqallaurrituŋitchuq qanuq iñuich isummatiqaqtilaaŋannik inmigun, inmiñi iḷisimavluni qanuq isumaqaqtilaaŋannik."
3259," Now a certain man, a Pharisee named Nicodemus, who was a member of the Jewish ruling council, ","Tavra iñuk inŋaruq Pharisee-guruaq atiqaqtuaq Nicodemus-mik, atanauraq Jew-guruani. "
3260," came to Jesus at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.” ","Taamna iñuk qaiŋaruq Jesus-mun unnuami aasii uqallautivlugu, Rabbi, iḷisimarugut iḷisaurrautilaaġnik qairuaq God-miñ, qanuq kialiqaa piyumiñaitkai tamatkua aliuġnaqtuat nalupqinaiyautauruat savaaġiratin, God-im itqatigiŋisuaqpani. "
3261," Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigikpiñ. Iñuk anitqiŋisuaġumi, iḷitchuġiyumiñaitchuq God-im atanniqsimmataanik. "
3262," Nicodemus said to him, “How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter his mother’s womb and be born a second time, can he?”","Nicodemus uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Qanuġluni iñuk aniyumiñaqpa utuqqalikami? Isitqikkumiñaqpa aakami iḷuanun aasii aniḷuni? "
3263," Jesus answered, “I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born of water and spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigikpiñ. Iñuk aniŋisuaġumi imikun Ilitqusiġiksuakullu, isiġumiñaitchuq God-im atanniqsimavianun. "
3264," What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. ",Tamatkua aniruat iñuŋniñ iñugruiññaurut. Tamatkualiasii kisiisa Ilitqusiġiksuam anitqiksitaŋi iñuuniaqtut Ilitqusiġiksuatun. 
3265," Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘You must all be born from above.’ ","Aliuġnak uqallautikapkiñ inna, Anitqiksuksraupiaqtutin. "
3266," The wind blows wherever it will, and you hear the sound it makes, but do not know where it comes from and where it is going. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.”","Anuġi anuqłiġuuruq suŋnamun pisukami, aasii tusaallagiñ anuġivaalua, aglaan nalurutin sumiñ qaisilaaŋanik naagga sumun aullaqtilaaŋanik.

3267," Nicodemus replied, “How can these things be?” ","Nicodemus uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Qanuġluni taamna piyumiñaqpa? "
3268," Jesus answered, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you don’t understand these things? ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Iḷisaurraugaluaqłutin Israel-nun taamna kaŋiqsiḷaitpiuŋ? "
3269," I tell you the solemn truth, we speak about what we know and testify about what we have seen, but you people do not accept our testimony. ","Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigikpiñ. Uqautiqaqtugut iḷisimaraptiŋnik suli iḷitchuġipkairugut tautuŋakkaptigun, aasii akuqtuŋitkisi uqaluktuavut. "
3270," If I have told you people about earthly things and you don’t believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things? ","Uqautiŋagupkiñ nunamiŋŋaqtauruanik aasii ilivich arguagivlugich, qanuġlutin ukpiġiyumiñaqpigich quliaqtuaġutigupkiñ qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruanik? "
3271, No one has ascended into heaven except the one who descended from heaven – the Son of Man. ,"Kiñaliqaa mayuŋaitchuq qiḷaŋmun aglaan taamna atqaŋaruaq qiḷaŋmiñ, Iġñiŋa Iñuum."
3272," Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, ","Aasii Moses kiviŋmatun nimiġiaq nunagluktuami, tainnatun Iġñiŋa Iñuum kiviktaksraupiaqtuq, "
3273, so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.”,kiñaliqaa ukpiqtuaq ilaanun iñuggutiqaquvlugu isuitchuamik. 
3274," For this is the way God loved the world: He gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. ","God-im piviuttaġivaił̣ł̣ugich nunam iñuŋi aitchuutigiŋagaa Iġñitualuni, kiñaliqaa ukpiqtuaq iġñiŋanun tammaquŋił̣ł̣ugu aglaan iñuggutiqaquvlugu isuitchuamik. "
3275," For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world should be saved through him. ","Qanuq God-im tiliŋaitkaa Iġñiq nunamun isivġiqsigitqulugu nunam iñuŋiñun, aglaan annaurrigitquvlugu."
3276," The one who believes in him is not condemned. The one who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the one and only Son of God. ","Iñuk ukpiqtuaq ilaanun isivġiqsauŋitchuq. Iñuk ukpiŋitchuaq isivġiqsauganiktuq, qanuq ukpiŋaitchuq Iġñitualuanun God-im. "
3277," Now this is the basis for judging: that the light has come into the world and people loved the darkness rather than the light, because their deeds were evil. ","Aasii iñuich isivġiqsaurut qanuq qaummaq qaiŋagaluaqtuq nunamun, aasii iñuich piviuttaġiłhaaġaat taaqtuaq qaummaġmiñ qanuq piḷġusiŋich pigiitchuaguvlutiŋ. "
3278," For everyone who does evil deeds hates the light and does not come to the light, so that their deeds will not be exposed. ","Qanuq iñupayaam piḷġusiqaqtuam pigiitchuamik uumigigaa qaummaq, suli qaiḷaitchuq qaummaġmun, piḷġusiñi satqummiġasugalugich. "
3279," But the one who practices the truth comes to the light, so that it may be plainly evident that his deeds have been done in God.","Aglaan iñuk iñuusiqaqtuaq iḷumun ittuamik qairuq qaummaġmun, iñuusiñi salapqiquvlugu qaummaġmun kamaksrisilaamiñik God-mik."
3280," After this, Jesus and his disciples came into Judean territory, and there he spent time with them and was baptizing. ","Taavsruma aquagun Jesus iḷitchitquraniḷu aullaŋarut Judea-mun, aasii tavraniinŋaruq itqatigivlugich iḷitchitqurani suli paptaiqsivḷuni. "
3281," John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there, and people were coming to him and being baptized. ","John-tauq paptaiqsiŋammiuq Aenon-mi qaniŋani Salim, qanuq ayuġnaiñŋaruq imiq tavrani. Iñuich qaiŋarut tavruŋa aasii paptaiqsauvlutiŋ, "
3282, (For John had not yet been thrown into prison.),qanuq John tigutaaqtauŋaił̣ł̣uni suli.
3283, Now a dispute came about between some of John’s disciples and a certain Jew concerning ceremonial washing. ,Tavra Jew-guruaq John-lu iḷitchitquraŋi uqavaaŋarut pisigivlugu salummaqtauniq aŋaiyyuliqiniġmi. 
3284," So they came to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you on the other side of the Jordan River, about whom you testified – see, he is baptizing, and everyone is flocking to him!”","Tavra qaiŋarut John-mun aasii uqallautivlugu, Rabbi, taimña iñuk piqatauŋaruaq iliŋnun taavanitchiani Jordan iḷitchuġipkaŋaran iñuŋnun, amma paptaiqsiruq aasii iluqaġmiŋ iñuich ullakkaat. "
3285," John replied, “No one can receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven. ","John kiuŋagai, Iñupayaaq piyumiñaqtuq kisianik God-im pitqukpani. "
3286," You yourselves can testify that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but rather, ‘I have been sent before him.’ ","Ilivsi quliaqtuaġumiñaqsiŋarusi uqallakama Christ-guŋiññivḷuŋa, aglaan tilirauŋaruŋa itqanaiyautitquvlugu. "
3287," The one who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands by and listens for him, rejoices greatly when he hears the bridegroom’s voice. This then is my joy, and it is complete. ","Iñuk tuvaaqatiksrautiniŋaruaq uiksrautauruq, aasii uiksrautim avilaitqataa makitaruaq saniġaani, quviasuktuq atqunaqłuni tusaakamiuŋ uiksrautim nipaa.

3288, He must become more important while I become less important.”,"Ilaa kamanaqsisaiññaqtuksrauruq, aasii uvaŋa kamanaiqsaiññaqtuksrauruŋa."
3289, The one who comes from above is superior to all. The one who is from the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to all. ,"Iñuk qairuaq paŋmaŋŋa kamanałhaaqtuq iluqaiññiñ. Aasii iñugruiññaq nunam pigigaa, suli nunamiŋŋaqtanik uqaluqaqtuq. Iñuk qairuaq qiḷaŋmiñ kamanałhaaqtuq iluqaiññiñ, "
3290," He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but no one accepts his testimony. ","aasii quliaqtuaqaqtuq tautuŋaramiñik tusaaŋaraġmiñiglu, naaggauvva kiapayaaq akuqtuŋitkaa quliaqtuaŋa. "
3291, The one who has accepted his testimony has confirmed clearly that God is truthful. ,Aglaan iñuum akuqtuiruam uqaluanik nalupqinaiġaa God iḷumun innivḷugu. 
3292," For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he does not give the Spirit sparingly. ","Iñuk God-im tiliraŋa uqaqtuq uqaluŋiñik God-im, qanuq God-im aitchuġaa iluqaanik suaŋŋataanik Ilitqusiġiksuam. "
3293, The Father loves the Son and has placed all things under his authority. ,"Aapam piviuttaġigaa Iġñiq, aasii aitchuutigiŋagai supayaat ilaanun. "
3294," The one who believes in the Son has eternal life. The one who rejects the Son will not see life, but God’s wrath remains on him.","Iñuk ukpiqtuaq Iġñiġmun isuitchuamik iñuggutiqaqtuq, aasii iñuk kamaksriŋitchuaq Iġñiġmik iñuggutiqaġniaŋitchuq, aglaan God-im tatavsaġniaġaa."
3295, Now when Jesus knew that the Pharisees had heard that he was winning and baptizing more disciples than John ,Pharisees tusaaŋarut Jesus iḷitchitquraukkałhaaqsiñivḷugu paptaiqsił̣haaġnivḷugulu John-miñ. ( 
3296," (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples were), ","Ilaa ami Jesus paptaiqsiŋitkaluaqtuq, aglaan iḷitchitquraŋi kisimiŋ.) "
3297, he left Judea and set out once more for Galilee.,"Tavra Jesus tusaakami taavrumiŋa, qimaŋagaa Judea aullatqikł̣uni Galilee-mun, "
3298, But he had to pass through Samaria. ,aasii ilaa Samaria-kuaqtuksrauŋaruq. 
3299," Now he came to a Samaritan town called Sychar, near the plot of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph. ","Tavra tikiñŋaruq iniqpaŋmun, atiliŋmun Sychar-mik, Samaria-miittuami qanittuaq nautchiaqaġviŋmun Jacob aitchuutigiŋaraanun iġñiġmiñun Joseph-mun. "
3300," Jacob’s well was there, so Jesus, since he was tired from the journey, sat right down beside the well. It was about noon.","Jacob nivviaŋa tavraniinŋaruq, aasii Jesus piḷaiqł̣uni iglauvlutiŋ aquptaaŋaruq saniġaanun nivviam, uvluq qitiqqaqpalliŋman."
3301," A Samaritan woman came to draw water. Jesus said to her, “Give me some water to drink.” ","Aġnaq Samaria-ġmiu imiqtaŋaruq aasii Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Imiksriñŋa. "
3302, (For his disciples had gone off into the town to buy supplies.) ,Iḷitchitquraŋi iniqpaŋmuŋarut tauqsiġiaqłutiŋ niqiksramiŋnik. 
3303," So the Samaritan woman said to him, “How can you – a Jew – ask me, a Samaritan woman, for water to drink?” (For Jews use nothing in common with Samaritans.)","Tavra Samaria-ġmium aġnam kiuŋagaa, Qanuġimña ilivich Jew-guruatiin qasiḷivich imiksraġnik uvamniñ, aġnamiñ Samaria-ġmiumiñ? Qanuq Jew-guruat piñiaqatiqalaitchut Samaria-ġmiunik. "
3304," Jesus answered her, “If you had known the gift of God and who it is who said to you, ‘Give me some water to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.” ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Iḷisimaŋagupku suutilaaŋa aitchuutaa God-im, suli kiutilaaŋa qasiḷiruaq iliŋniñ imiksritquvluni, tavra qasiḷiqqaaġumiñaŋagaluaqtutin ilaanun aasii aitchuġumiñaŋagaluaġaatin iñuunaqtuamik imiġmik.

3308," But whoever drinks some of the water that I will give him will never be thirsty again, but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.” ","aglaan kiñapayaaq imiqtuaq imiġmiñ aitchuutiginiakkamniñ imiġulitqigñiaŋitchuq.

3311," The woman replied, “I have no husband.” Jesus said to her, “Right you are when you said, ‘I have no husband,’ ","Aġnam kiuŋagaa, Uigitchuŋa. Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Nalauttutin uqallakkavich uigiññivḷutin, "
3312," for you have had five husbands, and the man you are living with now is not your husband. This you said truthfully!”","qanuq uiqaŋagaluaqtutin tallimanik, aasii taamna paŋmapak pigikkan uigiŋitkiñ. Tainna uqallakkavich nalauttutin. "
3313," The woman said to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet. ","Tavra aġnam uqallautiŋagaa, Aŋuun, iḷitchuġiruŋa uqaqtautilaaġnik God-mun. "
3314," Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you people say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.” ","Maŋŋuvut Samaria-ġmiut aŋaiyyusuurut uumani iġġimi, aasiiḷi ilivsi Jew-guruasii uqaġuurusi Jerusalem-mi iñuich aŋaiyyuruksraunivḷugich. "
3315," Jesus said to her, “Believe me, woman, a time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem. ","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Aġnaaq, ukpiġiŋŋa, piviksraq qaiḷiqtuq aŋaiyyuvigiŋaiġñiaġmarruŋ Aapa uumani unnii iġġimi, naaggaunnii Jerusalem-mi. "
3316," You people worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, because salvation is from the Jews. ","Ilivsi Samaria-ġmiuguruasii iḷisimapiaŋitkiksi aŋaiyyuvigikkaqsi. Uvagut Jew-guruaguut iḷisimagikput aŋaiyyuvigikkaqput, qanuq annautiksraŋat iñuich kaŋiqaqtuq Jew-guruaniñ. "
3317," But a time is coming – and now is here – when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for the Father seeks such people to be his worshipers. ","Piviksraq qaiḷiqtuq paŋmapaglu itaniktuq, iḷumutun aŋaiyyurit aŋaiyyuviginiaġmarruŋ Aapa, qaałhiñakun piraġausiŋiḷaatigun, aglaan ilitqutchikun iḷumun ittuakullu. Qanuq tainna piruanun God aŋaiyyuvigitquruq. "
3318," God is spirit, and the people who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.” ","God ilitqusiuruq, aasii tamatkua aŋaiyyuruat ilaanun aŋaiyyuruksraupiaqtut ilitqutchikun iḷumun ittuakkullu. "
3319," The woman said to him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (the one called Christ); “whenever he comes, he will tell us everything.” ","Aġnaq uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Iḷisimaruŋa Messiah taggisiqaqtuaq Christ-mik qaiyumaaqtuq. Aasii qaigumi quliaqtuaġutiniaġaatigut supayaanik. "
3320," Jesus said to her, “I, the one speaking to you, am he.”","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagaa, Uvaŋa uqaqtuaŋaa iliŋnun ilaaguruŋa."
3321," Now at that very moment his disciples came back. They were shocked because he was speaking with a woman. However, no one said, “What do you want?” or “Why are you speaking with her?” ","Tavrani iḷitchitquraŋi qaiŋarut. Niġiiḷḷaqtauŋarut ilaan uqaqatigimammagu aġnaq, aglaan nalliat unnii apiqsriŋaitchuq, Susukpich? naagga, Summan uqaqatigiviuŋ aġnaq? "
3322," Then the woman left her water jar, went off into the town and said to the people, ","Tavra aġnam qimaŋagaa qattani, aasii aivḷuni iniqpaŋmun, aasii uqallautiŋagai iñuich, "
3323," “Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Surely he can’t be the Messiah, can he?” ",Qaiḷusi tautugiaqsiuŋ iñuk uqaurriga supayaanik piŋaramnik. Christ-guŋitkaluaqpa? 
3324, So they left the town and began coming to him.,"Tavra iliŋich aullaŋarut iniqpaŋmiñ, aasii qaivḷutiŋ Jesus-mun. "
3325," Meanwhile the disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, eat something.” ","Aġnaq aullaaniŋman, iḷitchitquraŋisa uqallautiŋagaat, Rabbi, niġġiiñ. "
3326," But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” ","Tavra ilaan kiuŋagai, Niqiqaqtuŋa niġiramnik nalukkavsiññik. "
3327," So the disciples began to say to one another, “No one brought him anything to eat, did they?” ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat apiqsruqtuutiŋarut, Iñuum una qaġġirriŋavauŋ niqiksraŋanik? "
3328," Jesus said to them, “My food is to do the will of the one who sent me and to complete his work. ","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Niqigauvva kamagilugu pisuutaa tilisiruam uvamnik, suli naatchiḷuŋa savaaŋanik."
3329," Don’t you say, ‘There are four more months and then comes the harvest?’ I tell you, look up and see that the fields are already white for harvest! ","Uqaġuurusi inna, kivriviksraq nautchianik tikiññiaqtuq sisamat tatqich pianikpata.

3330," The one who reaps receives pay and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps can rejoice together. ","Iñuktun kivrikami katitchikamiḷu palauvaksranik akiññaktuatun aasii quviasuqatigivlugu nautchirriiŋaruaq, tainnatuttauq iñuk ukpiqtitchiruaq iñuŋnik uvamnun, akiññagniaġmiuq isuitchuamun, suli quviasuqatigilugu quliaqtuaqtuaq sumulliqaa tusaayugaaġiksuanik. "
3331," For in this instance the saying is true, ‘One sows and another reaps.’ ","Innauvva uqaluusuuruaq nalautitchuuruq. Iñuum igḷua nautchirriiruq palauvaksranik, aasiiḷi alla kivrivḷuni katitchivḷuniḷu palauvaksranik. "

3333," Now many Samaritans from that town believed in him because of the report of the woman who testified, “He told me everything I ever did.” ","Iñugiaktuat Samaria-ġmiut iniqpaŋmiñ ukpiŋarut Jesus-mun, aġnaq quliaqtuaġman inna, Ilaan uqautiŋagaaŋa supayaanik piŋaramnik. "
3334," So when the Samaritans came to him, they began asking him to stay with them. He stayed there two days, ","Tavra Samaria-ġmiut qaikamiŋ ilaanun, apiġiŋagaat Jesus itqatigitquvlutiŋ, aasii uvliŋaruq malġuŋni uvluŋni. "
3335, and because of his word many more believed. ,Aasii iñugiavsaaqtuat ukpiliŋarut pisigivlugich uqaluŋi. 
3336," They said to the woman, “No longer do we believe because of your words, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this one really is the Savior of the world.”","Tavra uqallautiŋagaat aġnaq, Ukpiliŋaitchugut uqaluktin pisigigiññaġlugich, qanuq naalaġniŋagikput uvaptiŋnik, aasii iḷitchuġirugut ilaa iḷumutun Annaurriginiġaat iñuich."
3337, After the two days he departed from there to Galilee. ,Pianiŋmaŋnik uvluk malġuk ilaa aullaŋaruq Galilee-mun. 
3338, (For Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.) ,"Jesus uqallaŋaruq, God-im uqaqtaa nanġausiaqalaitchuq ilaan nunamiñi. "
3339," So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen all the things he had done in Jerusalem at the feast (for they themselves had gone to the feast).","Tavra tikiñman Galilee-mun, Galilee-ġmiut paġlaŋagaat, tautuŋavlugich iluqaisa savaaŋi Jerusalem-mi niqinaqimmata, qanuq iliŋitchauq niqinaqiyaqtuŋavlutiŋ."
3340, Now he came again to Cana in Galilee where he had made the water wine. In Capernaum there was a certain royal official whose son was sick. ,"Tavra Jesus Cana-mutqiŋaruq Galilee-miittuamun, imiġmik wine-guqtitchiviŋmiñun. Aasii Capernaum-mi ataniġnaqutilgum iġñiŋa naŋinniqsuq. "
3341," When he heard that Jesus had come back from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, who was about to die. ","Tusaakamiuŋ Jesus qaiñivḷugu Judea-miñ Galilee-mun, aullaqłuni apiġiŋagaa Jesus qaitquvlugu Capernaum-mun, aasii iłuaqsiḷugu iġñini tuquaqsiruaq. "
3342," So Jesus said to him, “Unless you people see signs and wonders you will never believe!” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Tautuŋisuaġuvsi aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautinik kiutilaamnun, ukpiġumiñaitchusi. "
3343," “Sir,” the official said to him, “come down before my child dies.” ","Ataniġnaqutilgum uqallautiŋagaa, Aŋuun, qaiñasuaġiñ miqłiqtuġa tuquŋaiñŋaan. "
3344," Jesus told him, “Go home; your son will live.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and set off for home.","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Aggiiñ, iġñiġiñ iñuuniaqtuq. Tavra iñuum ukpiġiŋagaa uqaluk Jesus uqallautaa inmiñun, aasii aullaqłuni. "
3345," While he was on his way down, his slaves met him and told him that his son was going to live. ","Aiñiaqtillugu, kivgaŋisa paaŋagaat aasii uqallautivlugu iġñiŋa iñuunivḷugu. "
3346," So he asked them the time when his condition began to improve, and they told him, “Yesterday at one o’clock in the afternoon the fever left him.” ","Tavra apiġiŋagai qavsiñuŋman iłuaqsiñmuksaġmagaan aasii kiuŋagaat, Ikpaksraq uanukłaaġman uunnautaiŋaruq. "
3347," Then the father realized that it was the very time Jesus had said to him, “Your son will live,” and he himself believed along with his entire household. ","Aapaŋa iḷisimaŋaruq tainnaiḷimman Jesus uqallaŋatilaaŋanik inmiñun, Iġñiġiñ iñuuniaqtuq. Tavra ilaa ukpiliŋaruq, igluqatipayaaniḷu. "
3348, Jesus did this as his second miraculous sign when he returned from Judea to Galilee.,Tavra taamna igḷua aliuġnaqtuam Jesus piraata qaikami Judea-miñ Galilee-mun.
3349," After this there was a Jewish feast, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. ","Taavruma aquagun niqinaqiviat Jews tikiñŋaruq, aasii Jesus Jerusalem-muŋaruq. "
3350," Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool called Bethzatha in Aramaic, which has five covered walkways. ","Tavra Jerusalem-mi imaqsuk inŋaruq tallimanik taġġisimaviḷik saniġaani paaqpaŋata, imnaich Hebrew-tun uqaluanni taggisilik Bethzatha. "
3351," A great number of sick, blind, lame, and paralyzed people were lying in these walkways. ","Taapkunani iñugiaktuat aulasuitchuat nalaŋarut, ayauŋaruat, tusiattuat, avatiŋich tuquŋaruallu. [ "
3352, Now a man was there who had been disabled for thirty-eight years. ,"Utaqqiugaġayugniqsut tavrani aulayyaksiaġivlugu imaq, qanuq pivikaakun isaġulik atqaġayugniqsuq tavruŋa aasii aulapkaqługu imaq, aasii immamuqqaaqtuaq imaq nutqapqaġman iłuaqsirauraqtuq qanusipayauramiñ naŋirrunmiñiñ.] "
3353," When Jesus saw him lying there and when he realized that the man had been disabled a long time already, he said to him, “Do you want to become well?” ","Iñuk tavraniinŋammiñiqsuq, naŋinŋaruaq 38 ukiuni. "
3354," The sick man answered him, “Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I am trying to get into the water, someone else goes down there before me.” ","Jesus tautukamiuŋ iḷisimavlugu sivisuruamik nalaruagutilaaŋa tavrani, ilaan uqallautiŋagaa, Iłuaqsirausukpich? "
3355," Jesus said to him, “Stand up! Pick up your mat and walk.” ","Naŋittuam uqallautiŋagaa, Aŋuun, imaq aularaġimman iñuqalaitchuŋa iḷiriksramnik imaqsuŋmun aasii piñiuraġniaqtilluŋa allam sivuligaġigaaŋa. "
3356," Immediately the man was healed, and he picked up his mat and started walking. (Now that day was a Sabbath.)","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Makittin. Tigulugich ikuvġatin. Pisuaġiñ. "
3357," So the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed, “It is the Sabbath, and you are not permitted to carry your mat.” ","Tavra tavraŋŋatchiaq iñuk iłuaqsirauŋaruq, aasii tiguvlugich ikuvġani pisuaŋaruq. Taamna uvluq Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋat."

3360," But the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had slipped out, since there was a crowd in that place.","Ilaisa apiġiŋagaat, Kisuimma iñuk uqallaktuaq iliŋnun, tigulugich ikuvġatin pisuaquvlutin? "
3361," After this Jesus found him at the temple and said to him, “Look, you have become well. Don’t sin any more, lest anything worse happen to you.” ","Tavra taamna iñuk iłuaqsirauruaq naluŋaruq kiutilaaŋanik iłuaqsirini. Qanuq Jesus piiŋaruq tavraŋŋa, iñuich iñugiakpaił̣ł̣utiŋ."
3362, The man went away and informed the Jewish leaders that Jesus was the one who had made him well.,"Taavruma aquagun Jesus paqinŋagaa aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, aasii uqallautivlugu, Uumaa, iłuaqsirutin. Piḷuksitqigñak iḷaanni pigiił̣haaqtuam kasuqpiaġaatin. "
3363," Now because Jesus was doing these things on the Sabbath, the Jewish leaders began persecuting him. ",Tavra iñuk aullaŋaruq aasii uqallautivlugich Jews Jesus-gunivḷugu iłuaqsirini. 
3364," So he told them, “My Father is working until now, and I too am working.” ","Taamna pisigivlugu Jew-guruat pimaqłuktaġniaŋagaat Jesus, taamna piñivḷugu Savaitchuani."
3365," For this reason the Jewish leaders were trying even harder to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was also calling God his own Father, thus making himself equal with God.","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagai, Aapaga savaktuq ataramik, aasiivsauq savaktuksraummiuŋa. "
3366," So Jesus answered them, “I tell you the solemn truth, the Son can do nothing on his own initiative, but only what he sees the Father doing. For whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.

3367," For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he does, and will show him greater deeds than these, so that you will be amazed. ","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, Iġñiq sumik piḷaitchuq ilimisun, aglaan piḷḷatualuktuq tautukkami Aapami piraŋiñik. Supayaanik Aapani pimman, Iġñiq tainnatun pimmiuq. "
3368," For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whomever he wishes. ","Qanuq Aapam piviuttaġigaa Iġñiq, suli iḷisautivlugu supayaanik piramiñik, aasii iḷisautiniaġaa kamanałhaaqtuanik savaanik tamatkunaŋŋa ilivsi aliuquvlusi. "
3369," Furthermore, the Father does not judge anyone, but has assigned all judgment to the Son, ","Qanuq Aapa aŋipkairuq tuquŋaruanik aasii aitchuqługich iñuggunmik, tainnatuttauq Iġñiq aitchuimmiuq iñuggunmik kimun pisukami. "
3370, so that all people will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.,"Aapa isivġiiŋitchuq iñuŋmik, aglaan Iġñiġmiñun aitchuutigiŋagaa iluqaan ataniġnaqun isivġiiyumiñaqsivḷugu. "

","Iñupayaanun taluġitquvlugu Iġñiq, tainnatuttauq taluġimmatun Aapa. Iñuum taluqsraŋitchuam Iġñiġmik taluġiŋiñmigaa Aapa tilisiruaq ilaanik."

3373," For just as the Father has life in himself, thus he has granted the Son to have life in himself, ","Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, ikarraq qaiḷiqtuq paŋmapaglu itaniktuq, tuquruat tusaaniaġmarruŋ nipaa Iġñiŋata God-im, aasii tamatkua tusaaruat iñuuniaqtut. "
3374," and he has granted the Son authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.","Aapatun inmiñi kaŋiuruatun iñuggunmun, tainnatulli aitchuŋagaa Iġñini suaŋŋanmik kaŋiuyumiñaqsivḷugu iñuggunmun ilaaniillugu. "

3383, “But I have a testimony greater than that from John. For the deeds that the Father has assigned me to complete – the deeds I am now doing – testify about me that the Father has sent me. ,"John inŋaruq ikualaruatun qaummaġiksuatullu qulliqsun, aasii quviasuutigillakkaluaġiksi qaummaŋa. "
3384," And the Father who sent me has himself testified about me. You people have never heard his voice nor seen his form at any time, ","Aglaan savaatka ukpiġnałhamaaqtut John unnii quliaqtuaŋiñiñ uvapkun, qanuq savaat Aapam piraksriutigikkaŋi naatquvlugich iḷitchuġipkautaurut iñuŋnun Aapamun tiliŋatilaamnik.

3391," How can you believe, if you accept praise from one another and don’t seek the praise that comes from the only God?","Qaiŋaruŋa Aapama ataniġnaqutaagun, aasii ilivsi akuqtuŋitkivsiŋa. Alla qaikpan ilaan ataniġnaqunmigun akuqtuġayaġiksi. "
3392," “Do not suppose that I will accuse you before the Father. The one who accuses you is Moses, in whom you have placed your hope. ","Nanġautisuuruasii avanmun aasii suliqutigiŋił̣ł̣ugu nanġausiaksraqsi God-miñ kisianiñ, qanuġlusi ukpiġumiñaqpisi? "
3393," If you believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me. ",Isumanasi uvamnun pasiñiaġasugalusi Aapamun. Moses-mik nalupqisuŋirrutigikkavsiññik pasiriqaqtusi. 
3394," But if you do not believe what Moses wrote, how will you believe my words?”","Ukpiġipiaŋaguvsigik Moses aglaaŋi, ukpiġiyumiñaġaluaġivsiŋa, qanuq aglaŋaruq quliaqtuaġivluŋa. "
3395, After this Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also called the Sea of Tiberias). ,Taavruma aquagun Jesus ikaaŋaruq taaguŋatchianun tasiata Galilee-m. Taamna tasiq taggisiqaġmiruaq Tiberias-mik. 
3396, A large crowd was following him because they were observing the miraculous signs he was performing on the sick. ,Aasii iñusalaich maliŋagaat tautuŋavlutiŋ aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautinik kiutilaamiñik iłuaqsivḷugich naŋirrutiqaqtuat. 
3397, So Jesus went on up the mountainside and sat down there with his disciples. ,"Jesus mayuŋaruq qimiqqamun, aasii tamauŋa aquptaaqłuni iḷitchitquraniḷu. "
3398, (Now the Jewish feast of the Passover was near.) ,Tavra Itqaun Qulaurrusiqiviŋmun niqinaqiviat Jews qalliŋaruq. 
3399," Then Jesus, when he looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming to him, said to Philip, “Where can we buy bread so that these people may eat?” ","Qiviaqami tautuŋagai iñusalaich qairuat inmiñun, Jesus uqallautiŋagaa Philip, Sumiñ tauqsiġñiaqpisa punniġnik makua iñuich niġitqulugich? "
3400," (Now Jesus said this to test him, for he knew what he was going to do.) ","Taamna uqallausiġiŋagaa uuktuaqsaqługu Philip, qanuq ilaa ilimiñi iḷisimaŋaruq suyumaaqtilaamiñik. "
3401," Philip replied, “Two hundred silver coins worth of bread would not be enough for them, for each one to get a little.” ","Philip kiuŋagaa, 200 taala naamayumiñaitchut punniqsisigisaġuptigik iñullaa mikiruuramikunnii niġiyumiñaqsiḷugu. "
3402," One of Jesus’ disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother, said to him, ","Iḷaŋata iḷitchitquraŋisa, Andrew-m Simon Peter-m aniqataata, uqallautiŋagaa Jesus. "
3403," “Here is a boy who has five barley loaves and two fish, but what good are these for so many people?”",Imma nukatpiaġruk maaniittuq tallimanik barley-ñik punniġutilik malġugniglu iqalluŋnik. Suliqutauniaqpat innatun iñugiaktigiruanun? 
3404," Jesus said, “Have the people sit down.” (Now there was a lot of grass in that place.) So the men sat down, about five thousand in number. ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Aquptaaqtitchigik iñuich. Taamna ini ivgukkaŋaruq. Tavraasii iñuich iluqaġmiŋ aquvinŋarut. Iñugiaktilaaqaqpalliŋarut 5,000-tun aŋutit. "
3405," Then Jesus took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed the bread to those who were seated. He then did the same with the fish, as much as they wanted. ","Tavra Jesus tiguŋagai punniġich, aasii quyaanikami God-mun, autaaŋagai aquppiruanun, tainnatun suli iqalluk, qanutun niġisuktilaaŋatiktun. "
3406," When they were all satisfied, Jesus said to his disciples, “Gather up the broken pieces that are left over, so that nothing is wasted.” ","Tavra niġianigataġmata pisuġuiqł̣utiŋ, ilaan uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurani, Katitchigik iḷakut kisiŋŋuqtauruat iksaluquŋiḷḷugich. "
3407, So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with broken pieces from the five barley loaves left over by the people who had eaten.,"Tavra iliŋisa katinŋagaich iḷakut aasii immiqł̣ugich qulit malġuk aguummaich tallimaniñ barley-ñiñ punniġniñ, iḷakuŋich taapkua niġiruat. "
3408," Now when the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus performed, they began to say to one another, “This is certainly the Prophet who is to come into the world.” ","Iñuich tautukamirruŋ Jesus savaktuaq taavrumiŋa aliuġnaqtuamik nalupqinaiġutauruamik kiutilaamiñun, uqallaŋarut, Tavra iḷumun uqaqtaa God-im qaiyumaaŋaruaq nunamun. "
3409," Then Jesus, because he knew they were going to come and seize him by force to make him king, withdrew again up the mountainside alone.","Puttuqsrivḷuni iñuŋnun qaiḷutiŋ tigguġlugluni umialiguqtitchaaqsimmanni, Jesus kisimi aullatqiŋaruq qimiqqanun."
3410," Now when evening came, his disciples went down to the lake, ","Unnugiaġman, iḷitchitquraŋi atqaŋarut tatchimun. "
3411," got into a boat, and started to cross the lake to Capernaum. (It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.) ","Ikivlutiŋ umiaqpauramun, ikaaqsaŋagaat tasiq Capernaum-mun. Taaqsigaluaqtillugu Jesus ullaŋaitkai suli. "
3412, By now a strong wind was blowing and the sea was getting rough. ,Tasiq qaiḷḷiġuŋaruq qanuq anuġiqpak anuqqaŋaruq. 
3413," Then, when they had rowed about three or four miles, they caught sight of Jesus walking on the lake, approaching the boat, and they were frightened. ","Ipuqsruanikamiŋ piŋasutulluunnii naagga sisamatun mile-luuġutitun, tautukamirruŋ Jesus pisuaqtuaq immam qaaŋagun qalliruaq umiaqpauramun, iliŋich iqsitchapiaġataŋarut. "
3414," But he said to them, “It is I. Do not be afraid.” ","Ilaan uqallautiŋagai, Uvaŋauruŋa, iqsiñasi. "
3415," Then they wanted to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land where they had been heading.","Tavra quyatchaŋarut ikitquyumavlugu umiaqpauramun, aasii tavrauvvaa nunaliñŋarut sivuniġikkamiŋnun."
3416," The next day the crowd that remained on the other side of the lake realized that only one small boat had been there, and that Jesus had not boarded it with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone. ","Uvlaakumman iñusalaich taaganitchianiinŋaruat tatchim, iḷitchuġiŋagaat atausisualuk umiaqpauraq tavraniinŋatilaaŋanik.

3417, But some boats from Tiberias came to shore near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks. ,Aasiivsauq allat umiaqpaurat Tiberias-miñ nunaliñŋarut qaniŋanun inim niġġivigiŋaraata iñuich punniġnik Atanġum quyyatiŋaraiññik. 
3418," So when the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and came to Capernaum looking for Jesus.","Tavra iñuich iḷitchuġikamiŋ Jesus piisilaaŋanik, iḷitchitquraŋiḷu, iliŋich iksruŋammiut umiaqpauranun aasii aullaqłutiŋ Capernaum-mun, ivaqługu Jesus."
3419," When they found him on the other side of the lake, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” ","Paqinnamirruŋ taaganitchiani tatchim, ilaisa uqallautiŋagaat, Rabbi, qaŋa mauŋaqpich? "
3420," Jesus replied, “I tell you the solemn truth, you are looking for me not because you saw miraculous signs, but because you ate all the loaves of bread you wanted. ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, ivaġivsiŋa niqinŋuġniqsi punniġnik pisigivlugu, pisigisuŋaġnagich tautukkasi aliuġnaqtuat nalupqinaiyautit kiutilaamnun. "
3421," Do not work for the food that disappears, but for the food that remains to eternal life – the food which the Son of Man will give to you. For God the Father has put his seal of approval on him.”","Siġġaqutiginagu niqiłhiñaq nuŋuraġaqtuaq, aglaallu siġġaqutigisiuŋ taamna nuŋulaitchuaq, niqitun ittuaq iñuupkaġumiñaqłusi isuitchuamun.

3423," Jesus replied, “This is the deed God requires – to believe in the one whom he sent.” ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Uvva savaaq savaaġitqukkaŋa God-im ilivsiññun, ukpiquvlusi Aapam tiliraŋanun. "

3425," Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”","Maŋŋuuvut niqiqaqtitautuiññaŋarut maana-mik nunagluktuamiinnamiŋ, aglausimaruq Bible-ni, “Ilaan niqiqaqtituiññaŋagai qiḷaŋmiñ.” "
3426," Then Jesus told them, “I tell you the solemn truth, it is not Moses who has given you the bread from heaven, but my Father is giving you the true bread from heaven.

3430, But I told you that you have seen me and still do not believe. ,Aglaan uqallautiŋagaluaqtillusi tautuŋanivḷuŋa aasiuvva ukpiŋitchusi.

3457, The Spirit is the one who gives life; human nature is of no help! The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and are life. ,"Ilitqusiq aitchuiruq iñuggunmik, timi aitchuiḷaitchuq iñuggunmik. Uqaluich uqautigiŋaratka ilivsiññun sivuniqaqtut ilitqusivsiññun aasii aitchuivḷutiŋ iñuggunmik. "
3458," But there are some of you who do not believe.” (For Jesus had already known from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him.) ",Aglaan iḷasi ukpiŋitchut. Jesus isuaniñqaŋa iḷisimaŋagai kisuutilaaŋat ukpiŋitchuat kiutilaaŋalu aitchuutiginnigniaqtuaq inmiñik. 
3459," So Jesus added, “Because of this I told you that no one can come to me unless the Father has allowed him to come.”","Tavra ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Taamna pisigivlugu uqallautiŋagivsi kiñaliqaa qaiyumiñaiññivḷugu Aapam qaiyumaliqsinŋisuaqpagu uvamnun."
3460, After this many of his disciples quit following him and did not accompany him any longer. ,Taavruma aquagun iñugiaktuat iḷitchitquraŋiñiñ qapiŋarut aasii kukiḷuqatigiŋaiqł̣ugu tavraŋŋaaglaan. 
3461," So Jesus said to the twelve, “You don’t want to go away too, do you?” ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq qulit malġugnun, Ilivsivsauq aullaġniaġmivisi? "
3462," Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life. ","Simon Peter-m kiuŋagaa, Ataniiq, kimun aullaġniaqpisa? Ilivich uqaluqaqtutin iñuunaqtuanik isuitchuamun. "
3463, We have come to believe and to know that you are the Holy One of God!” ,"Aasiiḷi uvagut ukpiliŋarugut, suli iḷitchuġianiŋagiptigiñ Piḷuutaitchuaġigaatin God-im. "
3464," Jesus replied, “Didn’t I choose you, the twelve, and yet one of you is the devil?” ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Piksraqtaaġiŋagivsi, ilivsi qulit malġuk, naaggauvva iḷari tuunġauruq. "
3465," (Now he said this about Judas son of Simon Iscariot, for Judas, one of the twelve, was going to betray him.)","Uqautigiŋagaa Judas iġñiŋa Simon Iscariot, qanuq iḷaŋata qulit malġuk aitchuutigiyumaaŋagaa."
3466, After this Jesus traveled throughout Galilee. He stayed out of Judea because the Jewish leaders wanted to kill him. ,"Taavruma aquagun Jesus kukiḷuŋaruq Galilee-mi. Kukiḷuguŋiñŋaruq Judea-mi, qanuq Jew-guruat tuqurviksraqsiuŋagaat. "
3467, Now the Jewish feast of Tabernacles was near. ,Tavra Jew-guruat niqinaqiviat tupiġni tikiyasiŋaruq. 
3468," So Jesus’ brothers advised him, “Leave here and go to Judea so your disciples may see your miracles that you are performing. ","Tavra Jesus nukaaluŋisa uqallautiŋagaat, Aullaġiñ maaŋŋa aasii Judea-muglutin, iḷitchitquratin taamani qiñiġumaut savaanik pikkaġnik. "
3469," For no one who seeks to make a reputation for himself does anything in secret. If you are doing these things, show yourself to the world.” ","Qanuq iñulimaaq nalunautchiḷuni savalaitchuq iḷisimatqugumi salapqiruakun. Tamatkua savaaġikapkich, salapqiġiñ iliŋnik iñupayaanun. "
3470, (For not even his own brothers believed in him.),Qanuq nukaaluŋi unnii ukpiŋaitchut ilaanun. 
3471," So Jesus replied, “My time has not yet arrived, but you are ready at any opportunity! ","Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Nalautinŋaitchuq aullaġviksraġa. Aglaan ilivsi aullaġumiñaqtusi qakuguliqaa, "
3472," The world cannot hate you, but it hates me, because I am testifying about it that its deeds are evil. ","qanuq nunam iñuŋisa uumigiŋitkaasi. Aglaan uvaŋa nunam iñuŋisa uumigigaanŋa, qanuq uqautigaluamiiġuugitka ilaisa piḷġusiŋich pigiiññivḷugich. "
3473, You go up to the feast yourselves. I am not going up to this feast because my time has not yet fully arrived.” ,"Ilivsi niqinaqiyaqtuġitchi. Uvaŋa niqinaqiyaqtuŋitchuŋa paŋmapak, qanuq nalautinŋaitchuq suli aullaġviksraġa. "
3474," When he had said this, he remained in Galilee.","Tainna uqallaqqaaqłuni, Galilee-miinŋaruq suli."
3475," But when his brothers had gone up to the feast, then Jesus himself also went up, not openly but in secret. ","Tavra nukaaluŋi aullaaniŋmata niqinaqiyyaqłutiŋ, Jesus-tauq aullaŋammiuq nalunautchivḷuni. "
3476," So the Jewish leaders were looking for him at the feast, asking, “Where is he?” ","Jew-guruat ivaġaluaŋagaat niqinaqiviŋmi uqaqłutiŋ, Sumiitpaimña? "
3477," There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some were saying, “He is a good man,” but others, “He deceives the common people.” ","Iñuich atqunaqługu uqamayuutigiŋagaat avanmun, iḷaŋich uqaqłutiŋ, Iñulluatauruq. Allalli uqaŋarut, Naumi, ilaa asiñuurriruq iñuŋnik. "
3478," However, no one spoke openly about him for fear of the Jewish leaders.","Tavra sivuuġavlutiŋ Jew-guruanik, iñuich uqaġiŋagaat nalunautchivḷutiŋ."
3479," When the feast was half over, Jesus went up to the temple courts and began to teach. ","Niqinaqivik qitiqquiḷivalliġman, Jesus aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmuŋaruq aasii iḷisaurrivḷuni. "
3480," Then the Jewish leaders were astonished and said, “How does this man know so much when he has never had formal instruction?” ","Jew-guruat aliuŋarut iḷisaurrutaagun uqaqłutiŋ, Qanuqłuni una iñuk iḷisimatigiva iḷisaurriqaŋaitkaluaŋŋaġmi? "
3481," So Jesus replied, “My teaching is not from me, but from the one who sent me. ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Iḷisaurrutiga uvaŋa pigiŋitkiga, aglaan pigigaa tilisiruam uvamnik. "
3482," If anyone wants to do God’s will, he will know about my teaching, whether it is from God or whether I speak from my own authority. ","Kiñaliqaa pisukkumi tuvraġuglugu God-im pisuutaa, ilaa iḷisimayumiñaqtuq iḷisaurrutiga God-miŋŋaqtautilaaŋanik naaggaqaa uvamniġruiññaq. "
3483," The person who speaks on his own authority desires to receive honor for himself; the one who desires the honor of the one who sent him is a man of integrity, and there is no unrighteousness in him. ","Iñuk iḷisaurriruaq ilaan isummatimiñik ivaqłiaruq nanġausiaksramiñik iñuŋniñ, aglaan taamna ivaqłiaruaq nanġausiaksraŋanik God-im tilirimi iḷumun ittuaguruq nalaunŋaruġlu. "
3484, Hasn’t Moses given you the law? Yet not one of you keeps the law! Why do you want to kill me?”,Moses aitchuŋaitpasi pitquranik? Naaggauvva nallivsiunnii kamagiŋitkai pitqurat. Summan tuqurviksraqsiuqpisiŋa? 
3485," The crowd answered, “You’re possessed by a demon! Who is trying to kill you?” ","Iñuich kiuŋagaat, Ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtutin. Kia tuqurviksraqsiuqpatin? "
3486," Jesus replied, “I performed one miracle and you are all amazed. ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Piŋaruŋa atautchimik savaamik, aasii iluqasi aliuġiŋagiksi. "
3487," However, because Moses gave you the practice of circumcision (not that it came from Moses, but from the forefathers), you circumcise a male child on the Sabbath. ","Moses piraksriŋagaasi nukatpiaġruich nalunaiñŋutchiqsuksrauvlugich. Nalunaiñŋutchiqsauviksraŋat miqłiqtut uvluq nalaurrutimman Savaiññiġmun nalunaiñŋutchiqsisuurusi Savaiññiġmi. Isagutiŋaitkaluaġmiuq taamna pitquraq Moses-miñ, aglaan maŋŋuuvsiññiñ sivuani Moses. "
3488," But if a male child is circumcised on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses is not broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath? ","Nalunaiñŋutchiḷḷakavsiuŋ nukatpiaġruk Savaiññiġmi, Moses pitquraŋi naviguŋił̣ł̣ugich, summan qinnautivisiŋa pisigivlugu iłuaqsikapku iñuum timaa surruipiaqługu Savaiññiġmi? "
3489," Do not judge according to external appearance, but judge with proper judgment.”","Isivġiiñasi qiññałhiñakun, aglaan isivġiisitchi nalaunŋaruakun."
3490," Then some of the residents of Jerusalem began to say, “Isn’t this the man they are trying to kill? ","Iḷaŋich Jerusalem-miut uqallaŋarut, Tavrauŋitpauna iñuk tuqurviksraqsiukkaŋat? "
3491," Yet here he is, speaking publicly, and they are saying nothing to him. Do the rulers really know that this man is the Christ? ","Aasiuvva maaniittuq, uqaqtuq salapqiruami, aasii qanuq nivliutilaitkaat. Iḷaanniipkua ataniġnaqusiraqtuat iḷitchuġipiaġisiuraaġaat Christ-gutilaaŋanik. "
3492," But we know where this man comes from. Whenever the Christ comes, no one will know where he comes from.”","Christ niptaqpan kiñapayaaq iḷisimayumiñaitchuq sumiñ qaisilaaŋanik, aglaan una iñuk iḷisimagikput sumiñ qaisilaaŋanik."
3493," Then Jesus, while teaching in the temple courts, cried out, “You both know me and know where I come from! And I have not come on my own initiative, but the one who sent me is true. You do not know him, ",Tavra Jesus iḷisaurrivḷuni aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi nipatuvluni uqallaŋaruq. Iḷisimagivsiŋaliqaa sumiñ qaisilaamnik. Aglaan qaiŋaitchuŋa uvaptuġruiññaq.

3494," but I know him, because I have come from him and he sent me.”","Uvaŋaaglaan iḷisimagiga, qanuq qairuŋa ilaaniñ, suli ilaan tiliŋagaaŋa. "
3495," So then they tried to seize Jesus, but no one laid a hand on him, because his time had not yet come. ","Tavra tigutaaġviksraqsiurraqsiŋagaat, aasii kialiqaa tiguŋaitkaa, qanuq aitchuutauviksraŋa tikiñŋaitchuq. "
3496," Yet many of the crowd believed in him and said, “Whenever the Christ comes, he won’t perform more miraculous signs than this man did, will he?”","Aasiivsauq iñugiaktuat iñuich ukpiliŋarut ilaanun, uqallakłutiŋ, Christ niptaġumi pił̣hamaniaqpa aliuġnaqtuanik uuma iñuum piŋaraŋiñiñ?"
3497," The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Jesus, so the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest him. ","Tavra Pharisees tusaakamisigik iñusalaich uqautiqaqtuat Jesus-mik, iliŋich aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu tilisiŋarut tigurinik tigutaaquvlugu. "
3498," Then Jesus said, “I will be with you for only a little while longer, and then I am going to the one who sent me. ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Nayuvsaallagniaġivsi aasii aullaġluŋa tilirimnun. "
3499," You will look for me but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.”","Ivaġniaġaluaġivsiŋa aasii paqinniaŋitkivsiŋa, aullaġviksrautimnun qaiyumiñaiñmiusi. "
3500," Then the Jewish leaders said to one another, “Where is he going to go that we cannot find him? He is not going to go to the Jewish people dispersed among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he? ","Tavra Jew-guruat uqaurrutiŋarut avanmun, Sumuaqsivauna uvaptiŋnun paqitchumiñaiġḷuni?

3501," What did he mean by saying, ‘You will look for me but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come’?”","Sumik sivuniqaqpauŋ uqallakami, Ivaġniaġaluaġivsiŋa paqitchumiñaitkivsiŋa? Sumik suli sivuniqaqpauŋ, Aullaġviksrautimnun qaiyumiñaitchusi?"
3502," On the last day of the feast, the greatest day, Jesus stood up and shouted out, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me, and ","Aqulliġmi uvluani niqinaqivium, naumaniqsrami uvlumi, Jesus makinŋaruq aasii nipatuvluni uqallakłuni, Kiñaliqaa imiġuliġumi, qaiḷuni uvamnun imiġli. "
3503," let the one who believes in me drink. Just as the scripture says, ‘From within him will flow rivers of living water.’” ","Innauvva Bible uqaluŋich uqaqtut iñukun ukpiqtuakun uvamnun, Iḷuaniñ maqiniaqtut kuuŋi iñuunaqtuam imġum. "
3504," (Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were going to receive, for the Spirit had not yet been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.)","Tavra taamna uqallausiġiŋagaa sivuniqaqługu Ilitqusiġiksuamik, tamatkua ukpiqtuat ilaanun aitchuusiaġiyumaakkaŋat, qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuaq aitchuutauganiŋaitchuq suli, Jesus aŋipkaqtauŋaił̣ł̣uni utiqtitauŋaił̣ł̣uniḷu qiḷaŋmun."
3505," When they heard these words, some of the crowd began to say, “This really is the Prophet!” ","Tusaakamisigik taapkua uqaluich, iḷaŋich iñuich uqallaŋarut, Una uqaqtigipiaġaa God-im qaiyumaaqtuaq sivuani Christ. "
3506," Others said, “This is the Christ!” But still others said, “No, for the Christ doesn’t come from Galilee, does he? ","Allalli uqallaŋarut, Ilaa Christ-gupiaqtuq. Aglaan iḷaŋich uqallaŋammiut, Christ qaiyumaaqpa Galilee-miñ? "
3507," Don’t the scriptures say that the Christ is a descendant of David and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?” ","Bible uqaluŋich uqaŋaitpat Christ maŋŋuqaġnivḷugu David-mik, aasii qaiḷuni Bethlehem-miñ, nunaaqqimiñ David iñuuvigiŋaraaniñ? "
3508, So there was a division in the crowd because of Jesus. ,Tavra atinġiŋarut iñuich ilaa pisigivlugu. 
3509," Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him.","Iḷaŋisa tigutaaġumalliŋagaluaġaat, aglaan iñuum tiguŋaitkaa."
3510," Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, “Why didn’t you bring him back with you?” ","Tavra tiguriŋich utiŋarut aŋaiyyuliqsiqpagnun Pharisee-ñullu, uqallautipkaqłutiŋ aasii, Summan qaġġisiŋitpisiuŋ? "
3511," The officers replied, “No one ever spoke like this man!” ","Tigurit kiuŋagaich, Qaŋaunnii iñuk uqaŋaitchuq taavrumatun iñuktun. "
3512," Then the Pharisees answered, “You haven’t been deceived too, have you? ","Pharisees kiuŋagaich, Asiñuurrauvisivsauq ilivsi? "
3513," None of the rulers or the Pharisees have believed in him, have they? ",Nalliŋich ataniġnaqusiraqtuat naagga Pharisee-ñiñ ilaanun ukpiliŋavat?

3518,[[ ,
3519, And each one departed to his own house. ,
3520, But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. ,"Tavra aiyaaŋarut iglullaamiŋnun, aasii Jesus aullaŋaruq Iġġianun Olives. "
3521," Early in the morning he came to the temple courts again. All the people came to him, and he sat down and began to teach them. ","Uvlaatchaurami Jesus qaitqiŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun. Iñuich iluqaġmiŋ qaiŋarut ilaanun, aasii aquviłłuni iḷisautiŋagai. "
3522, The experts in the law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught committing adultery. They made her stand in front of them ,"Iḷisaurrit pitquranik Pharisees-lu qaġġisiŋagaat aġnaq paqitauruaq allatuqłuni, aasii inillakługu qitiġmun. "
3523," and said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of adultery. ","Uqallautiŋagaat ilaa, Iḷisaurrii, una aġnaq paqitauruq allatuqtillugu. "
3524, In the law Moses commanded us to stone to death such women. What then do you say?” ,Moses pitqurani piraksriŋagaatigut tainnasiq uyaġaktautquvlugu. Qanuġli una aġnaq uqallausiġiviuŋ? 
3525," (Now they were asking this in an attempt to trap him, so that they could bring charges against him.) Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.

3526," When they persisted in asking him, he stood up straight and replied, “Whoever among you is guiltless may be the first to throw a stone at her.” ","Apiqsruqtuġaluaġmanni, ilaan qiviaŋagai aasii uqallautivlugich, Nallivsi piḷuutaitchuam miḷuqsaqqaaġliuŋ uyaġaŋmik. "
3527, Then he bent over again and wrote on the ground.,Atausivsaami putqiŋaruq aasii aglakłuni nunamun.

3639, Another sharp division took place among the Jewish people because of these words. ,"Iñugiaktuat uqaŋarut, Ilaa ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuq aasii kinnaġuqłuni. Summan naalaġniraksrauva? "
3640," Many of them were saying, “He is possessed by a demon and has lost his mind! Why do you listen to him?” ","Allat uqallaŋarut, Makua uqalugiŋitkai iñuum ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuam. Ilitqusiqł̣uk qiñillasipkaiḷḷava ayauŋaruanik?"

3642, Then came the feast of the Dedication in Jerusalem. ,"Ukiuguŋaruq aasii Jesus pisuaŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, taġġisimaaġviŋmi atiqaqtuami Solomon-mik. "
3643," It was winter, and Jesus was walking in the temple area in Solomon’s Portico. ","Tavra Jew-guruat katinŋarut avataanun aasii uqallautivlugu, Qanutun sivisutigiruamik nalautchuġaqtinniaqpisigut? Christ-guguvich, uqallautitigut nalupqinaiġḷugu. "
3644," The Jewish leaders surrounded him and asked, “How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.” ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Uqallautianiŋagaluaġivsi arguagigivsiŋa. Savaama ataniġnaqutaagun Aapama nalupqinaiyaġaluaġaa kiutilaaġa, "

3646, But you refuse to believe because you are not my sheep. ,"Imnaima naalaġnigaat nipiga, aasii iḷisimagitka, aasiiḷi maliġuaġaanŋa. "
3647," My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. ","Aasii isuitchuamik iñuupkaġniaġitka, iliŋich aasii nalupqinaitchuamik tammaġumiñaipiaqtut. Suli supayaam aqsaaġniktaaġiyumiñaitkai uvamniñ. "

3649," My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one can snatch them from my Father’s hand. ",Uvaŋalu Aapagalu atausiuruguk.
3650, The Father and I are one.”,Jew-guruat tigusitqiŋagalualgitchut uyaġaŋnik miḷḷuuġukługu. 
3651, The Jewish leaders picked up rocks again to stone him to death. ,"Jesus kiuŋagai, Qiñiqtinŋagivsi iñugiaktuanik savaalluatanik Aapamiñ, nalliatigun tamatkua uyaġagniaqpisiŋa? "
3652," Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good deeds from the Father. For which one of them are you going to stone me?” ","Jew-guruat kiuŋagaat, Uyaġagniaqsaaŋitkiptigiñ nalliatigun savaaġiksuat aglaan uqamaqłuutipkun God-ikun. Qanuq ilivich, iñugruiññauvlutin, iḷiuqtutin iliŋnik God-aunivḷutin. "
3653," The Jewish leaders replied, “We are not going to stone you for a good deed but for blasphemy, because you, a man, are claiming to be God.”","Jesus kiuŋagai, Aglautiŋaruq ilivsi nanmiñiq pitquravsiññi God uqallaŋanivḷugu inna, “Ilivsi god-aurusi.” "
3654," Jesus answered, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’? ","Iḷisimarugut Bible uqaluŋich iḷumun itilaaŋannik isuitchuamun, aasii ilaan taiŋagai god-inik tamatkua akuqtuiruat God-im uqaluŋiñik. "
3655," If those people to whom the word of God came were called ‘gods’ (and the scripture cannot be broken), ","Taamna tainnainman, summan pasivisiŋa uqamaqłuŋnivḷuŋa uqallakama Iġñiġinivḷuŋa God-mun? Taamnauruŋa Aapam piksraqtaaġiŋakkaŋa aasii tilivḷuŋa nunamun. "

3659," Then they attempted again to seize him, but he escaped their clutches.","Jesus aullatqiŋaruq ikaaqługu Jordan, inimun John paptaiqsivigiqqaaŋaraŋanun, aasii tavraniitkaqsivḷuni. "
3660," Jesus went back across the Jordan River again to the place where John had been baptizing at an earlier time, and he stayed there. ","Iñugiaktuat iñuich ullaŋagaat aasii uqaŋarut, John piŋaitchuq aliuġnaqtuanik, aglaan supayaat John uqalugiŋakkaŋi uumuuna iñukun iḷumun ittut. "
3661," Many came to him and began to say, “John performed no miraculous sign, but everything John said about this man was true!” ",Tavra iñugiaktuat tavrani ukpiŋarut Jesus-mun.
3662, And many believed in Jesus there.,
3663," Now a certain man named Lazarus was sick. He was from Bethany, the village where Mary and her sister Martha lived. ","Tavra iñuk naŋiliŋaruq atiqaqtuaq Lazarus-mik iñuuruaq Bethany-mi, aniqatigiik Mary-vḷu Martha-vlu iñuuviaŋni. "
3664," (Now it was Mary who anointed the Lord with perfumed oil and wiped his feet dry with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.) ","Taamna Mary tivraġiksaiŋaruaq Ataniġmik, aasii tilaktiqługich isigaŋi nutchamiñik. Aniqatiginiġaa naŋittuam Lazarus-gum. "
3665," So the sisters sent a message to Jesus, “Lord, look, the one you love is sick.” ","Tavra aniqatigiik tilisiŋaruk Jesus-mun uqaqłutik, Ataniiq, taimña piviuttaġikkan naŋiliqsuq. "
3666," When Jesus heard this, he said, “This sickness will not lead to death, but to God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.” ","Tavra Jesus tusaakamiuŋ uqallaŋaruq, Taamna naŋirrun tuqqunmun isuqaŋitchuq, aglaan ittuq kamanaqsiḷġutigitquvlugu God-mun, taamna Iġñiŋa God-im kamanaqsiḷiqtautquvlugu taavrumuuna naŋirrutikun. "
3667, (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.),Jesus piviuttaġiŋagai Martha-lu aniqataalu Mary Lazarus-lu. 
3668," So when he heard that Lazarus was sick, he remained in the place where he was for two more days. ","Tavra tusaakamiuŋ Lazarus naŋinnivḷugu, uvlivsaaŋaruq malġugnik inimi irvigiramiñi."
3669," Then after this, he said to his disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.” ","Tavra ilaa uqallaŋaruq iḷitchitquramiñun, Utiqta Judea-mun. "
3670," The disciples replied, “Rabbi, the Jewish leaders were just now trying to stone you to death! Are you going there again?” ","Iḷitchitqurat uqallautiŋagaat, Rabbi, Jew-guruat uyaġagnik miḷḷuuġniaqqammiŋasugaatin, aasiuvva taamuŋatqiaqsiḷgitpich? "
3671," Jesus replied, “Are there not twelve hours in a day? If anyone walks around in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world. ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Qulit malġugnik ikarraqaŋitpa qaummaġiksuaq uvluq? Kiñaliqaa pisuaqtuaq uvlumi putukkitchuitchuq, qanuq tautuksipkallagaa qaummaŋata mattuma nunam. "
3672," But if anyone walks around at night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.”","Kiñaliqaa pisuaqtuaq unnuami putukkiññiaqtuq, qanuq qaummaġmik piitchuq. "
3673," After he said this, he added, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep. But I am going there to awaken him.” ","Taavrumiŋa uqallaŋaruq. Aasii uqallautivlugich, Avilaitqatikput Lazarus siñiksaaniŋaruq, aglaan aullaġniaqtuŋa itiqtitchaqtuġlugu. "
3674," Then the disciples replied, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.” ","Iḷitchitqurat uqallautiŋagaat, Ataniiq, siñiksaaniŋagumi iłuaqsiñiaqtuq. "
3675," (Now Jesus had been talking about his death, but they thought he had been talking about real sleep.)","Jesus uqautigiŋagaa tuquniŋa, aasiiḷi isumaŋarut sivuniġinasugalugu piḷaiŋaiqsiaġniŋa siñikłuni. "
3676," Then Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus has died, ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai nalupqinaiqł̣ugu, Lazarus tuquŋaruq. "
3677," and I am glad for your sake that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.” ",Quyaruŋa pisigivlusi taamaniinŋiññama ukpiquvlusi. Ullaglakput. 
3678," So Thomas (called Didymus) said to his fellow disciples, “Let us go too, so that we may die with him.”","Thomas taggisiqaqtuaq igḷuanik Malġim uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitqurauqatini, Uvagullu aullaqta tuquqatigiyumagikput Ataniq."
3679," When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had been in the tomb four days already. ","Tavra Jesus tikiññami, iḷitchuġiŋagaa Lazarus iḷuvviviŋmiitanikługu uvluni sisamani. "
3680," (Now Bethany was less than two miles from Jerusalem, ","Bethany qaninŋaruq Jerusalem-mun, malġuktuvalliq mile-luuġutiktun. "
3681, so many of the Jewish people of the region had come to Martha and Mary to console them over the loss of their brother.) ,Aasii iñugiaktuat Jew-guruaniñ qaiŋaniqsut Martha-mullu Mary-mullu quviasaaġiaqługik aniqataakkun. 
3682," So when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went out to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house. ","Martha tusaakami Jesus qalliñivḷugu, aullaqłuni paaŋagaa, Mary aimmipkaqługu. "
3683," Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died. ","Martha-m uqallautiŋagaa Jesus, Ataniiq, maaniinŋaguvich aniqatiga tuqunayaitchuq. "
3684," But even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will grant you.”","Aasii paŋmapak-unnii iḷisimaruŋa supayaamik apiqsriguvich God-miñ, God-im aitchuġniaġaatin. "
3685," Jesus replied, “Your brother will come back to life again.” ","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Aniqatin aŋiñiaqtuq. "
3686," Martha said, “I know that he will come back to life again in the resurrection at the last day.” ","Martha-m uqallautiŋagaa, Iḷisimaruŋa ilaa aŋitqigñiaqtilaaŋanik aŋŋiviŋmi aqulliġmi uvlumi. "
3687," Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. The one who believes in me will live even if he dies, ","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Uvaŋa aŋŋisauruŋa iñuggutauruŋalu. Iñuk ukpiqtuaq uvamnun tuqugaluaġluqtum-unnii iñuuniaqtuq. "

3689," She replied, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who comes into the world.”","Martha-m kiuŋagaa, Aaŋ Ataniiq, ukpiqtuŋa Christ-gutilaaġnik, Iġñiŋa God-im, qaiyumaaŋaruaq nunamun."
3690," And when she had said this, Martha went and called her sister Mary, saying privately, “The Teacher is here and is asking for you.” ","Taamna uqallausiġianikamiuŋ, Martha aullaŋaruq aasii ququaqługu aniqatini Mary, uqautiŋagaa nipikisuuraqłuni, Iḷisaurri tikitchuq aasiamma qaitqugaatin. "
3691," So when Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him. ","Aasii Mary-m tusaakamiuŋ taamna, qilamik makinŋaruq aasii ullakługu Jesus. "
3692," (Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was still in the place where Martha had come out to meet him.) ","Tavra Jesus tikipiaġataŋaitchuq suli nunaaqqimun, aglaan inimiinŋaruq-suli Martha-m kasuutiviani. "
3693," Then the people who were with Mary in the house consoling her saw her get up quickly and go out. They followed her, because they thought she was going to the tomb to weep there.","Tavra Jew-guruat tuvaaqatauruat Mary-mun iglumi quviasaaqługu, tautukamirruŋ makittuaq qilamiqsruqłuni animman, maliŋagaat, isumavlutiŋ iḷuvviviŋmuksaġasugalugu qiayaqtuqłuni taamani."
3694," Now when Mary came to the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said to him, “Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.” ","Tavra Mary, tikiññami Jesus irvianun tautukługu, sitquŋaruq sivuġaanun, uqallakłuni ilaanun, Ataniiq, maaniinŋaguvich aniqatiga tuqunayaitchuq. "
3695," When Jesus saw her weeping, and the people who had come with her weeping, he was intensely moved in spirit and greatly distressed. ","Jesus tautukamiuŋ qiaruaq, Jew-guruallu qaiqatiŋi qiarraqsimmataptauq, ilaa aniqsaapaŋaruq iḷunŋutchakłuni. "
3696," He asked, “Where have you laid him?” They replied, “Lord, come and see.” ","Aasii ilaan apiġiŋagai, Sumun iḷiŋavisiuŋ? Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Ataniiq, qaiḷutin tautugiaġuŋ. "
3697, Jesus wept. ,Jesus qulviŋaruq. 
3698," Thus the people who had come to mourn said, “Look how much he loved him!” ","Tavra Jew-guruat uqallaŋarut, Tautuksiuŋ piviuttaġipaluŋniġaa. "
3699," But some of them said, “This is the man who caused the blind man to see! Couldn’t he have done something to keep Lazarus from dying?”","Aasiiḷi iḷaŋich uqallaŋarut, Uvvauma aŋmaiḷḷaruam ayauŋaruam irraŋnik tuqutchaiḷiyumiñaiñŋavauŋ taamna iñuk?"
3700," Jesus, intensely moved again, came to the tomb. (Now it was a cave, and a stone was placed across it.) ","Tavra Jesus aniqsaapatqiŋaruq, aasii tikiñŋaruq iḷuvviviŋmun qaiġusuŋmun, uyaġaŋmik umiqaqtuamun. "
3701," Jesus said, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the deceased, replied, “Lord, by this time the body will have a bad smell, because he has been buried four days.” ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Piiqsiuŋ uyaġak.

3702," Jesus responded, “Didn’t I tell you that if you believe, you would see the glory of God?” ","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Uqallautiŋaitpigiñ ukpiġumiñaġuvich tautukkumiñaġnivḷutin kamanautaanik God-im? "
3703," So they took away the stone. Jesus looked upward and said, “Father, I thank you that you have listened to me. ","Tavra piiŋagaat uyaġak. Aasii Jesus qiviaqłuni qunmun uqallaŋaruq, Aapaaŋ, quyyavigigikpiñ tusaaŋakamŋa. "
3704," I knew that you always listen to me, but I said this for the sake of the crowd standing around here, that they may believe that you sent me.” ","Iḷisimaruŋa tusaasuugiŋma ataramik, aglaan taapkua uqallausiġigitka pisigivlugich iñuich qikaqtuat uvani, ukpiliquvlugich iliŋnun tiliŋatilaamnik.

3705," When he had said this, he shouted in a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!” ","Taamna uqallausiġianikamiuŋ, Jesus ququulaŋagaa nipatuvluni, Lazarus anniiñ. "
3706," The one who had died came out, his feet and hands tied up with strips of cloth, and a cloth wrapped around his face. Jesus said to them, “Unwrap him and let him go.”","Tavra tuquŋaŋaruaq iñuk aniŋaruq, argaŋi isigaŋiḷu nimmaaġutiqaqłutiŋ iḷuvviuġutinik, suli kiiñaŋa nimmaaġutiqaqłuni ukił̣haamik.

3707," Then many of the people, who had come with Mary and had seen the things Jesus did, believed in him. ","Iñugiaktuat Jew-guruani qaiqatauruat Mary-mun suli tautukłutiŋ Jesus piraanik, ukpiliŋarut ilaanun. "
3708, But some of them went to the Pharisees and reported to them what Jesus had done. ,Aglaan iḷaŋich aullaŋarut Pharisee-ñun aasii quliaqtuaġutivlugich sumik Jesus savaktilaaŋanik. 
3709," So the chief priests and the Pharisees called the council together and said, “What are we doing? For this man is performing many miraculous signs. ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich Pharisees-lu katinŋagaich ataniġnaqusiraqtuat aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Qanuġniaqpisa? Qanuq taimña iñuk savaktuq iñugiaktuanik aliuġnaqtuanik ukpiġnaqtuanik iñuŋnun. "
3710," If we allow him to go on in this way, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away our sanctuary and our nation.”","Iḷatchiġuptigu tainna, iñupayaaq ukpiġniaqtuq ilaanun, suli Rome-miut qaiñiaqtut aasii suksraunġiġḷugik iluqaaktun aŋaiyyuvikpakpullu nunauniqpullu. "
3711," Then one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said, “You know nothing at all! ","Aasii iḷaŋat, Caiaphas, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiġikkaŋat taavrumani ukiumi, uqallaŋaruq ilaiññun, Iḷisimaŋitchusi sumikunnii. "
3712, You do not realize that it is more to your advantage to have one man die for the people than for the whole nation to perish.” ,Kaŋiqsiŋaitchusi anniqsuutauniaqtilaaŋanik uvaptiŋnun iñuk tuqqurrikpan iñuŋnik tamatkiġḷugu nunauniqput iñuktuummaan suksraunġiquŋiḷḷugu. 
3713," (Now he did not say this on his own, but because he was high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the Jewish nation, ","Ilaan uqallausiġiŋaitkaa taamna inmisuġruiññaq, aglaan aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiġivlugu taavrumani ukiumi uqaŋaruq God-miñ tuqqurriruksraunivḷugu Jesus Jew-guruanik. "
3714," and not for the Jewish nation only, but to gather together into one the children of God who are scattered.) ","Aasiivsauqami Jew-guruanun kisiŋiḷaaŋiññun, aglaan atausiŋŋuġukługich miqłiqtuŋi God-im siaminŋaruat sumiḷiqaa. "
3715, So from that day they planned together to kill him.,Tavra taavrumaŋŋaaglaan uvlumiñ sivunniuŋarut qanuġlugu tuqutchukługu Jesus.
3716," Thus Jesus no longer went around publicly among the Judeans, but went away from there to the region near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples. ","Jesus tavraŋŋaaglaan kukiḷuŋaiqsuq salapqiruakun akunġanni Jew-guruat, aglaan aullaŋaruq tavraŋŋa nunamun qanittuamun nunagluktuamun, nunaaqqimun atiqaqtuamun Ephraim-mik, aasii tavraniinŋaruq iḷitchitquraniḷu. "
3717," Now the Jewish feast of Passover was near, and many people went up to Jerusalem from the rural areas before the Passover to cleanse themselves ritually. ","Tavra niqinaqivia Itqautim Qulaurrusiqiviŋmun Jew-guruani qalliŋaruq.

3718," Thus they were looking for Jesus, and saying to one another as they stood in the temple courts, “What do you think? That he won’t come to the feast?” ","Ilaisa ivaŋagaat Jesus suli uqaqłutiŋ avanmun qikallaġmiŋ aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, Qanuq isumavisi? Niqinaqiyaqtuġniaŋiññasugivisiuŋ? "
3719," (Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it, so that they could arrest him.)","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu Pharisees-lu piraksriiŋarut kialiqaa iḷisimakpagu sumiitilaaŋa Jesus, iḷitchuġipkaquvlutiŋ tigutaaġukługu."
3720," Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus lived, whom he had raised from the dead. ","Itchaksrat uvlut kisiŋŋuġmata Itqaġviŋmun Qulaurrusiqiviŋmik, Jesus qaiŋaruq Bethany-mun, Lazarus iñuuvianun, Jesus aŋipkaŋaraŋata tuqqunmiñ. "
3721," So they prepared a dinner for Jesus there. Martha was serving, and Lazarus was among those present at the table with him. ","Nullautchiuġutiŋagaat Jesus tavrani. Martha savakłuni, suli Lazarus iḷauvluni taapkunuŋa niġiruani piqatigivlugu ilaa. "
3722, Then Mary took three quarters of a pound of expensive aromatic oil from pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus. She then wiped his feet dry with her hair. (Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.) ,"Mary tigusiŋaruq atautchisun uqumaisilaaqaqtuamik akisuruamik tivraġiksaunmik atiqaqtuamik Nard, aasii tivraġiksaŋagai isigaŋi Jesus, suli saluaqtiqługich nutchamiñik, aasii iglu naimanaqsiŋaruq tipaanik tivraġiksautim. "
3723," But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (the one who was going to betray him) said, ","Tavra Judas Iscariot, iḷaŋat iḷitchitqurat, taamna aitchuutiginnikkumaaqtuaq Jesus-mik, uqallaŋaruq, "
3724, “Why wasn’t this oil sold for three hundred silver coins and the money given to the poor?” ,Summan una tivraġiksaun tuniŋaitpa 300 taalamun aasii aitchuutigilugich iḷiappauruanun? 
3725," (Now Judas said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief. As keeper of the money box, he used to steal what was put into it.) ","Taamna uqallausiġiŋagaa, suksraġiŋitkaluaŋŋaisa iḷiappauruat aglaan ilaa tigligayuktauvluni, suli ilaan pigivlugu maniqaġviat tigusisuuŋaruq tavraŋŋa iksraniñ. "
3726," So Jesus said, “Leave her alone. She has kept it for the day of my burial. ","Jesus uqallaŋaruq, Iḷaksianagu. Ilaan pigiliuŋ pigikkani uvluanun iḷuvviuqtauniksrama. "
3727," For you will always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me!”","Iḷiappauruat nayuqtigigisi ataramik, aglaan uvaŋa nayuqtiginiaŋitkivsiŋa ataramik."
3728," Now a large crowd of Judeans learned that Jesus was there, and so they came not only because of him but also to see Lazarus whom he had raised from the dead. ","Iñugiapiaġataqtuat iñusalaich Jew-guruat qaiŋarut iḷitchuġikamiŋ Jesus tavraniitilaaŋanik, pisigisuŋaġnagu Jesus kisian aglaallu tautugiaqługu Lazarus aŋipkaŋakkaŋa tuqqunmiñ. "
3729," So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus too, ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich sivunniuŋammiut tuqutchukługu Lazarus, "

3731, The next day the large crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. ,Uvlutqigman iñugiapiaġataqtuat niqinaqiyaqtuŋaruat tusaaŋarut Jesus Jerusalem-muaqsiñivḷugu. 
3732," So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him. They began to shout, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!” ","Tavra tigusiŋarut qisiqsiutinik palm napaaqtuŋiññiñ, aasii aullaqłutiŋ paaqsaqługu nipaalavlutiŋ, Hosanna. Nanġaqtauli God. Nanġaqtauli qairuaq pisivlugu Ataniq.

3733," Jesus found a young donkey and sat on it, just as it is written, ","Tavra Jesus paqinŋaruq kakaktim nuġġaŋanik aasii kakaksiġvigivlugu, aglaaguniŋatun Bible-ni,"
3734," “Do not be afraid, people of Zion; look, your king is coming, seated on a donkey’s colt!” ","Iñusalaich itqatauŋaruat Jesus ququaġmagu Lazarus iḷuvviviŋmiñ, aŋipkaqługu tuqqunmiñ, quliaqtuaġiŋagaat taamna iñuŋnun. "
3735," (His disciples did not understand these things when they first happened, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about him and that these things had happened to him.)","Taamna pisigivlugu iñugiaktuat paaġiaŋagaat Jesus, tusaavlutiŋ ilaa savaktilaaŋanik taavrumiŋa aliuġnaqtuamik nalupqinaiyautauruamik kiutilaaŋanun. "
3736, So the crowd who had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead were continuing to testify about it. ,"Tavra Pharisees tavrani uqaŋarut avanmun, Iḷitchuġisitchi qanuġnaġumiñaiqsilaaŋanik. Tautuksiuŋ, iñupayaat iluqaġmiŋ malliutigaat."
3737," Because they had heard that Jesus had performed this miraculous sign, the crowd went out to meet him. ",Greek-nik iḷaqaŋarut aŋaiyyuyaqtuqtuanik nanġaiyaqtuqłutiglu God-mik niqinaqiviŋmi. 
3738," Thus the Pharisees said to one another, “You see that you can do nothing. Look, the world has run off after him!”","Tavra taapkua ullaŋagaat Philip, Bethsaida-ġmiu Galilee-miittuamiñ, aasii uqallautivlugu, Aŋuun, tautugukkikput Jesus. "
3739, Now some Greeks were among those who had gone up to worship at the feast. ,Philip aullaqłuni uqallautiŋagaa Andrew. Tavra Andrew-vlu Philip-lu uqallautiŋagaak Jesus. 
3740," So these approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and requested, “Sir, we would like to see Jesus.” ","Tavra Jesus kiuŋagik, Ikarraq tikitchuq Iġñiŋan Iñuum kamanaqsipkaqtauviksraŋa. "
3741," Philip went and told Andrew, and they both went and told Jesus. ","Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, palauvaksraq kataŋisuaqpan nunam iḷuanun aasii tuquliḷuni nauriḷaitchuq. Aglaan tuqulikpan, iñugiaksiḷuni nauniaqtuq. "

3743," I tell you the solemn truth, unless a kernel of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains by itself alone. But if it dies, it produces much grain. ","Iñuum savautiniaġumiŋa, maliġuagaksraġipiaġaaŋa, aasii sumiitkuma, tavrani kivgaġa inniaġmiuq. Kialiqaa savautikpaŋa, Aapam nanġaġniaġaa savaurriruaq uvamnik."
3744," The one who loves his life destroys it, and the one who hates his life in this world guards it for eternal life. ","Paŋmapak iłuiḷḷiuqpaktuŋa. Aasii qanuq uqallagniaqpik? Uqallagniaqpik, Aapaaŋ annautiŋŋa uumaŋŋa ikarraġmiñ? Naumi, taamna sivuniġivlugu tikitchuŋa uumuŋa ikarraġmun. "
3745," If anyone wants to serve me, he must follow me, and where I am, my servant will be too. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.","Aapaaŋ, nanġausiaqaġiñ nalautchumaagaqsikkapkun.

3746," “Now my soul is greatly distressed. And what should I say? ‘Father, deliver me from this hour’? No, but for this very reason I have come to this hour. ","Iñugiaktuat makitaruat tamaani tusaaŋagaat nipi aasii uqallakłutiŋ kallulanivḷugu. Allalli uqallaŋarut, Isaġulgum uqautiŋagaa. "
3747," Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.” ","Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Taamna nipi tusaġnaŋaruq ilivsi pisigivlusi, uvaŋaŋił̣aaq. "
3748, The crowd that stood there and heard the voice said that it had thundered. Others said that an angel had spoken to him. ,Paŋmapak isivġiqsauniksraŋa mattuma nunam iñuata tikitchuq. Paŋmapak Tuunġaq atanniqsimariŋa mattuma nunam iñuŋisa akiiḷirauniaqtuq. 
3749," Jesus said, “This voice has not come for my benefit but for yours. ",Aasii kiviktauguma aŋarraurakun uvaŋa qaisuliqsinniaġitka iñupayaat uvamnun.

3752, (Now he said this to indicate clearly what kind of death he was going to die.),"Jesus kiuŋagai, Uvaŋa qaummatauruaŋaa nayuutiuravsaallaŋniaqtuŋa ilivsiññun. Sivunmuktuġitchi qaummatiqaŋŋavsi, iḷaanni taaqsisiviaġaasi. Iñuk pisuaqtuaq taaqtuami naluruq suŋnamuktilaamiñik. "
3753," Then the crowd responded, “We have heard from the law that the Christ will remain forever. How can you say, ‘The Son of Man must be lifted up’? Who is this Son of Man?” ",Qaummatiqaŋŋavsi ukpiġitchi qaummatauruamun miqłiqtuliutiyumausi God-mun qaummatiqaġlusi.
3754," Jesus replied, “The light is with you for a little while longer. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The one who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going. ","Tavra Jesus uqallausiġianikamiuŋ taamna, aullaŋaruq aasii iriqłuni ilaiññiñ. "
3755," While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light.” When Jesus had said these things, he went away and hid himself from them.","Tavra ilaa piŋagaluaqtillugu qanutun iñugiaktigiruanik aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautinik kiutilaamiñun takkuġmiŋni, iliŋich ukpiŋaitchut ilaanun. "
3756," Although Jesus had performed so many miraculous signs before them, they still refused to believe in him, ","Tainnainŋaniqsuq uqaluk uqautigiŋakkaŋa uqaqtaata God-im Isaiah-m taŋŋiquvlugu,"
3757," so that the word of Isaiah the prophet would be fulfilled. He said, “Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” ","Tainnaitkaluaŋŋaan iñugiaktuat ataniġnaqutiqaqtuaniñ ukpiŋarut ilaanun, aglaan sivuuġagivlugich Pharisees, iliŋich iḷitchuġipkaŋaitchut taavrumiŋa, anitauniaġasugalutiŋ Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuvianniñ, "
3758," For this reason they could not believe, because again Isaiah said, ",qanuq nakuaġiłhaaŋagaat nanġausiaqaġniq iñuŋniñ naumavlugu nanġausiaqaġniġmiñ God-miñ.
3759, “He has blinded their eyes ,"Tavra Jesus nipatusivḷuni uqallaŋaruq, Iñuk ukpiqtuaq uvamnun ukpiqsiññaŋitchuq uvamnun aglaan tilirimnullu. "
3760,"and hardened their heart, ",Aasii iñuum tautuktuam uvamnik tautukkaa tilisiŋaruaq uvamnik. 
3761,so that they would not see with their eyes ,"Qaiŋaruŋa qaummatauvluŋa iñupayaanun, kiñaliqaa ukpiqtuaq uvamnun taaqtuamiitquŋił̣ł̣ugu. "
3762,"and understand with their heart, ","Kialiqaa tusaakpagich uqalutka aasii kamagiŋił̣ł̣ugich, uvaŋa isivġiŋitkiga, qanuq qaiŋaitchuŋa isivġiġiaġlugich iñuich, aglaan annautiyaqtuqługich. "
3763,"and turn to me, and I would heal them.” ",Iñuk ayyairuaq uvamnik suli akuqtuŋił̣ł̣ugich uqalutka isivġiqsiqaqtuq. Uqaluich uqautigikkaġma isivġiġñiaġaa aqulliġmi uvlumi. 
3764," Isaiah said these things because he saw Christ’s glory, and spoke about him.","Qanuq uqaŋaitchuŋa uvaŋaġruiññaq ataniġnaqutipkun, Aapam tilisiruam uvamnik ilaan piraksriŋagaaŋa sunik uqaqtuksrautilaamnik. "
3765," Nevertheless, even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they would not confess Jesus to be the Christ, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue. ",Aasii iḷisimaruŋa taapkua uqaluich iñuggutiqaġnaqtut isuitchuamik. Tavraasii suna uqallausiġiraġa iḷisaurrutigiraġalu pigiga Aapam uqallausiatun uvamnun.
3766, For they loved praise from men more than praise from God.,
3767," But Jesus shouted out, “The one who believes in me does not believe in me, but in the one who sent me, ",
3768, and the one who sees me sees the one who sent me. ,
3769," I have come as a light into the world, so that everyone who believes in me should not remain in darkness. ",
3770," If anyone hears my words and does not obey them, I do not judge him. For I have not come to judge the world, but to save the world. ",
3771, The one who rejects me and does not accept my words has a judge; the word I have spoken will judge him at the last day. ,
3772," For I have not spoken from my own authority, but the Father himself who sent me has commanded me what I should say and what I should speak. ",
3773," And I know that his commandment is eternal life. Thus the things I say, I say just as the Father has told me.”",
3774," Just before the Passover feast, Jesus knew that his time had come to depart from this world to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he now loved them to the very end. ","Tavra sivuani niqinaqivian Itqautim Qulaurrusiqiviŋmun, Jesus iḷitchuġiŋaruq ikarraq tikisilaaŋanik aullaġviksrani mattumaŋŋa nunamiñ Aapamun.

3775," The evening meal was in progress, and the devil had already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, that he should betray Jesus. ",Tavra Jesus-lu iḷitchitquraniḷu nullautchiŋarut. Tuunġaum isummiŋagaa Judas Simon Iscariot iġñiŋa aitchuutigitquvlugu Jesus. 
3776," Because Jesus knew that the Father had handed all things over to him, and that he had come from God and was going back to God, ","Tavra Jesus iḷisimaŋaruq Aapamun qaisilaaŋanik iluqaan suaŋŋan inmiñun, suli iḷisimaŋammiuq qaiŋatilaamiñik God-miñ suli aullaġniaqtilaamiñik God-mun. "
3777," he got up from the meal, removed his outer clothes, took a towel and tied it around himself. ","Jesus tavrani makinŋaruq niġġiviŋniñ, iḷivḷugich qalliich annuġaani, tavsiŋaruq imaiyaunmik. "
3778, He poured water into the washbasin and began to wash the disciples’ feet and to dry them with the towel he had wrapped around himself.,"Tavra kuvisiŋaruq imiġmik iqaqqiviŋmun, aasii iqaġirraqsivḷugich iḷitchitqurat isigaŋich, saluaqtiqługich imaiyaunmik tavsigikkamiñik. "
3779," Then he came to Simon Peter. Peter said to him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” ","Tikiñŋagaa Simon Peter, aasii Peter-m apiġiŋagaa, Ataniiq, iqaġiaqsivigich isigatka? "
3780," Jesus replied, “You do not understand what I am doing now, but you will understand after these things.” ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Sutilaaġa nalugaluaġiñ paŋmapak, aglaan aquvatigun kaŋiqsiñiaqtutin. "
3781," Peter said to him, “You will never wash my feet!” Jesus replied, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.” ","Peter-m uqallautiŋagaa, Iqaġiyumiñaipiaġitin isigatka. Jesus kiuŋagaa, Iqaġiŋitkupkiñ, piqatauyumiñaitchutin uvamnun. "
3782," Simon Peter said to him, “Lord, wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head!” ","Simon Peter-m uqallautiŋagaa, Ataniiq, iqaġikkich isigałhiñaŋiḷaatka aglaan argatka niaquġalu. "
3783," Jesus replied, “The one who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean. And you disciples are clean, but not every one of you.” ","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Iñuk ivvaqtuaniŋaruaq iqaġiraksraitchuq isigaŋiaglaan, qanuq salummaqtuq tamaġmi. Aasiuvva salumarusi, aglaan tamatkiŋitchusi. "
3784," (For Jesus knew the one who was going to betray him. For this reason he said, “Not every one of you is clean.”)","Qanuq Jesus iḷisimaŋaruq kimun aitchuutiginiaqtilaamiñik, taamna pisigivlugu ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Tamatkiġḷusi salummaŋitchusi."
3785," So when Jesus had washed their feet and put his outer clothing back on, he took his place at the table again and said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you? ","Iqaġianikamigich isigaŋich, tiguanikługiḷḷu qalliich annuġaani, inimiñukami uqallautiŋagai, Iḷisimavisi sutilaamnik ilivsiññun? "
3786," You call me ‘Teacher’ and ‘Lord,’ and do so correctly, for that is what I am. ","Taisuugivsiŋa Iḷisaurrimik Ataniġmiglu, aasii nalauttusi qanuq tainnasiuruŋa. "
3787," If I then, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you too ought to wash one another’s feet. ","Uvaŋaasii, ilivsi Ataniqsi Iḷisaurriksiḷu, iqaġiŋagupkich isigasi, ilivsivsauq iqaġiraksraġigaluaġmigisi isigasi avanmun. "

3789," I tell you the solemn truth, the slave is not greater than his master, nor is the one who is sent as a messenger greater than the one who sent him. ","Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, kivgaq una kamanałhaaŋitchuq ataniġmiñiñ, naaggaunnii taamna tilirauruaq kamanałhaaŋiñmiuq taavrumaŋŋa tilirimiñiñ. "
3790," If you understand these things, you will be blessed if you do them.","Tamatkua iḷisimaguvsigik, quviaginiaġisi piguvsigik."
3791," “What I am saying does not refer to all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But this is to fulfill the scripture, ‘The one who eats my bread has turned against me.’ ","Sivuniġiŋitkivsi iluqasi, iḷisimagitka piksraqtaatka.

3792," I am telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it happens you may believe that I am he. ","Uqallautigivsi taavrumiŋa paŋmapak taŋŋiqsaŋaiñŋaan, nalautpan ukpiliquvlusi Christ-gutilaamnik. "
3793," I tell you the solemn truth, whoever accepts the one I send accepts me, and whoever accepts me accepts the one who sent me.”","Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, iñuk taamna akuqtuiruaq kimigliqaa tilikkamnik akuqtuiruq uvamnik, aasiivsauq taavruma akuqtuiruam uvamnik akuqtuġmigaa tiliriga."
3794," When he had said these things, Jesus was greatly distressed in spirit, and testified, “I tell you the solemn truth, one of you will betray me.” ","Tavra Jesus tainna uqaanikami, iłuiḷḷiuqpaliŋaruq aasii uqallakłuni, Iḷumutupiaġataq uqallautigivsi, iḷavsi aitchuutiginiaġaaŋa. "
3795," The disciples began to look at one another, worried and perplexed to know which of them he was talking about. ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat qiñiġutiŋarut avanmun, nalupqisukłutiŋ kimik uqautiqaqtilaaŋanik. "
3796," One of his disciples, the one Jesus loved, was at the table to the right of Jesus in a place of honor. ","Iḷaŋat iḷitchitquraŋisa, Jesus piviuttaġikkaŋa, ikusiksimaaŋaruq qaniłłuni Jesus-mun. "
3797, So Simon Peter gestured to this disciple to ask Jesus who it was he was referring to. ,"Tavra Simon Peter-m kiruaqtuŋagaa niaqqumiñik sivuniqaqługu, apiqquuŋ kimik uqautiqaqtilaaŋanik. "
3798," Then the disciple whom Jesus loved leaned back against Jesus’ chest and asked him, “Lord, who is it?” ","Tavra tainna ikusiksimaallaġmi qaniłłuni Jesus-mun uqallautiŋagaa, Ataniiq, kiuva? "
3799," Jesus replied, “It is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish.” Then he dipped the piece of bread in the dish and gave it to Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son. ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Taamnauruq aitchuġniakkaġa uumiŋa punniviñauramik misuqqaaġlugu. Tavra misuqqaaqługu punniviñauraq, qaiñŋagaa Judas-mun, iġñiŋanun Simon Iscariot. "
3800," And after Judas took the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, “What you are about to do, do quickly.” ","Tavra Jesus qaisaniŋmagu punniviñauraq Judas-mun, Satan isiŋaruq ilaanun. Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Piyumakkan piuŋ qilamik. "

3802," Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him to buy whatever they needed for the feast, or to give something to the poor.)

3803, Judas took the piece of bread and went out immediately. (Now it was night.),"Tavra, aitchuusiaġianikamiuŋ punniviñauraq, tavrauvvaa Judas aniŋaruq. Unnuaguruq."

3861," If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as its own. However, because you do not belong to the world, but I chose you out of the world, for this reason the world hates you.

3864," If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. But they no longer have any excuse for their sin. ","Qaiŋaiḷḷuŋa uqautiŋaitkupkich pasirauyumiñaitkaluaqtut, aglaan paŋmapak pasiraurut piḷuunmikkun. "
3865, The one who hates me hates my Father too. ,Iñuum uumikłiqsuam uvamnik uumigimmigaaptauq Aapaga. 
3866," If I had not performed among them the miraculous deeds that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen the deeds and have hated both me and my Father.

3877," But I tell you the truth, it is to your advantage that I am going away. For if I do not go away, the Advocate will not come to you, but if I go, I will send him to you. ","Aasii qaigumi, ilaan qanuqpisiiḷḷiñiaġai nunam iñuŋi piḷuutikun nalaunŋarualiqinikullu isivġiġvikullu. "
3878," And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment – ","Qanuqpisiiḷḷiñiaġai piḷuutikun, qanuq ukpiŋitchut uvamnun. "
3879," concerning sin, because they do not believe in me; ","Qanuqpisiiḷḷiñiaġai nalaunŋarualiqinikun, qanuq aullaqtuŋa Aapamun aasii ilivsi tautuaġiŋaiġñiaġivsiŋa. "

3881," and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been condemned.","Iñugiaktuanik suli uqautiksraqaġaluaqtuŋa ilivsiññun, kaŋiqsiyumiñaitkisi paŋmapak. "
3882," “I have many more things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now.

3883," But when he, the Spirit of truth, comes, he will guide you into all truth. For he will not speak on his own authority, but will speak whatever he hears, and will tell you what is to come. ","Ilaan kamanaqsiḷiġniaġaaŋa, qanuq uqautiniaġiga uqalumnik aasii ilaan qaaŋiqsinniaġaiḷḷi ilivsiññun. "

3889," Jesus could see that they wanted to ask him about these things, so he said to them, “Are you asking each other about this – that I said, ‘In a little while you will not see me; again after a little while, you will see me’?

3914," I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them safe in your name that you have given me, so that they may be one just as we are one.

3930," When he had said these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the Kidron Valley. There was an orchard there, and he and his disciples went into it. ","Jesus aŋaiyyutigianikamigich taapkua uqaluich, ilaa aullaŋaruq iḷitchitquraniḷu ikaaqługu kuuġuuraq Kidron isiqłutiŋ napaaqtut nauviannun Gethsemane-mun. "

3933," Then Jesus, because he knew everything that was going to happen to him, came and asked them, “Who are you looking for?” ","Tavra Jesus, iḷisimavluni supayaamik piñiaqtuamik inmiñun, saarvaŋaruq aasii uqallakłuni ilaiññun, Kiña ivaqpisiuŋ? "
3934," They replied, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He told them, “I am he.” (Now Judas, the one who betrayed him, was standing there with them.) ","Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Jesus Nazareth-miu. Tavra Jesus uqallautiŋagai, Ilaaguruŋa. Judas, aitchuutiginniktuaq ilaanik, makitaqatauŋaruq ilaiññun."
3935," So when Jesus said to them, “I am he,” they retreated and fell to the ground. ","Jesus uqallautimmatiŋ ilaagunivḷuni, taluqsratchakłutiŋ utiqqiaŋarut aasii ulġuvlutiŋ nunamun. "
3936," Then Jesus asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.” ","Jesus apiġitqiŋagai, Kiña ivaqpisiuŋ? Ilaisa kiuŋagaat, Jesus Nazareth-miu. "
3937," Jesus replied, “I told you that I am he. If you are looking for me, let these men go.” ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Uqallautiŋasugaavsi ilaagunivḷuŋa. Tavra ivaġuvsiŋa, ukua iḷitchitquratka aullaġlich. "
3938," He said this to fulfill the word he had spoken, “I have not lost a single one of those whom you gave me.”","Taamna taŋŋiutausalgiññiqsuq uqaluŋnun Jesus uqallausiġiŋaraŋiññun aŋaiyyukami, Taapkunaŋŋa aitchuutiŋniñ uvamnun tammaiŋitchuŋa atautchimik-unnii. "
3939," Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, pulled it out and struck the high priest’s slave, cutting off his right ear. (Now the slave’s name was Malchus.) ","Tavrani Simon Peter savikpaqaqłuni, amuŋagaa aasii anauvlugu aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata kivgaŋa, aasii taliqpianik siutaiqł̣ugu. Kivgam atqa Malchus. "

3941, Then the squad of soldiers with their commanding officer and the officers of the Jewish leaders arrested Jesus and tied him up. ,Tavra aŋuyaktit atanauraŋatalu Jew-guruat munaqsriŋisalu tiguŋagaat Jesus aasii qiḷiqsruivḷugu. 
3942," They brought him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. ","Aullautiqqaaŋagaat Annas-mun, qanuq aaparuaġimmagu Caiaphas-gum. Taamna Caiaphas aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat taavrumani ukiumi. "

3944," Simon Peter and another disciple followed them as they brought Jesus to Annas. (Now the other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, and he went with Jesus into the high priest’s courtyard.) ","Simon Peter-m allavlu iḷitchitquram maliŋagaak Jesus.

3945," But Simon Peter was left standing outside by the door. So the other disciple who was acquainted with the high priest came out and spoke to the slave girl who watched the door, and brought Peter inside. ","Peter qikaŋaruq siḷami paami.

3946," The girl who was the doorkeeper said to Peter, “You’re not one of this man’s disciples too, are you?” He replied, “I am not.” ","Niviaqsiam upkurriqirim apiġiŋagaa Peter, Iḷagiŋitkaluaqpatin uuma iñuum iḷitchitquraŋisa? Ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Iḷagiŋitkaanŋa."

Peter also was standing with them, warming himself.)","Tavra kivgat munaqsriḷḷu igniqsuŋarut qanuq qiiyanaqłuni, aasii qikaġniqsut pasiaqłutiŋ. Peter iḷagiŋagaat qikaqłuni pasiaqtuaq."
3948," While this was happening, the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching. ",Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata apiqsruqtuŋagaa Jesus iḷitchitquraŋigun iḷisaurrutiŋigullu. 
3949," Jesus replied, “I have spoken publicly to the world. I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple courts, where all the Jewish people assemble together. I have said nothing in secret. ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Uqaŋaruŋa iñuŋnun salapqiruakun, ataramik iḷisaurrisuuruŋa aŋaiyyuviŋiññiḷu aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmiḷu, iluqaġmiŋ Jew-guruat katirvikaaŋannun. Uqaŋaitchuŋa sumik nalunautchiḷuŋa. "

3951," When Jesus had said this, one of the high priest’s officers who stood nearby struck him on the face and said, “Is that the way you answer the high priest?” ","Taamna uqallausiġianiŋmagu, iḷaŋata munaqsrich qikaqtuam saniġaani patiŋagaa Jesus uqallakłuni, Tainna kiuraksraġiviuŋ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat?

3952," Jesus replied, “If I have said something wrong, confirm what is wrong. But if I spoke correctly, why strike me?” ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Uqaŋaguma killukuaġluŋa, iḷitchuġipkaġuŋ iñuŋnun killukuaġutiga. Aasii nalaulluŋa uqaġuma, summan patikpiŋa? "
3953," Then Annas sent him, still tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.","Tavra Jesus qiḷiqsruiŋavlugu, Annas-gum aullaqtitkaa Caiaphas-mun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannun taavrumani ukiumi."
3954," Meanwhile Simon Peter was standing in the courtyard warming himself. They said to him, “You aren’t one of his disciples too, are you?” Peter denied it: “I am not!” ","Tavra Simon Peter qikaŋaruq pasiaqłuni.

3955," One of the high priest’s slaves, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, “Did I not see you in the orchard with him?” ","Iḷaŋata kivgaŋisa aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata, nanmiñiŋata iñuum Peter-m siutaiŋakkaŋata, apiġiŋagaa, Tautuŋaitpigiñ Jesus piqatigivlugu Gethsemane-mi? "
3956," Then Peter denied it again, and immediately a rooster crowed.",Peter piiḷaatqiŋaruq. Aasii tavrauvvaa tiŋmiaq nipanŋaruq.
3957," Then they brought Jesus from Caiaphas to the Roman governor’s residence. (Now it was very early morning.) They did not go into the governor’s residence so they would not be ceremonially defiled, but could eat the Passover meal. ",Tavra iñuich aullautiŋagaat Jesus igluqpaŋaniñ Caiaphas isivġiġviŋmun igluqpaŋaniittuamun kavanam. Uvlaatchaurauŋaruq.

3960," Pilate told them, “Take him yourselves and pass judgment on him according to your own law!” The Jewish leaders replied, “We cannot legally put anyone to death.” ","Pilate uqallautiŋagai, Pisiuŋ ilivsiññik aasii isivġiġḷugu ilivsi nanmiñiq pitquravsigun.

But as it is, my kingdom is not from here.” ","Jesus kiuŋagaa, Umialguŋitchuŋa mattumuŋa nunamun. Umialguguma mattumuŋa nunamun, kivgatka aŋuyakkayaqtut aitchuutautquŋiḷḷuŋa Jew-guruanun.

3966," Then Pilate said, “So you are a king!” Jesus replied, “You say that I am a king. For this reason I was born, and for this reason I came into the world – to testify to the truth. Everyone who belongs to the truth listens to my voice.” ","Tavra Pilate uqallautiŋagaa, Uvva umialgurutin? Jesus kiuŋagaa, Ilivich uqallaktutin umialgunivḷuŋa. Taamna pisigivlugu aniŋaruŋa.

3971, Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged severely. ,Tavra Pilate tigupkaŋagaa Jesus aasii ipiġaqtuqtiłługu. 
3972," The soldiers braided a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe. ","Aasiiḷi aŋuyaktit niaquġusiuŋarut kakiḷḷaġnaqtuanik qisiqsiutinik, aasii iḷivḷugu niaquanun, suli annuġaaqługu suŋauraammaġiksuamik annuġaamik umialiktun. "

3990," Pilate also had a notice written and fastened to the cross, which read: “Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews.” ","Iñugiaktuat Jew-guruat taiguaŋagaat taamna aglak, qanuq ini Jesus kikiaktuurrauvia qaninŋaruq iniqpaŋmun, suli aglaaguvluni Hebrew-tun Latin-tullu Greek-tullu. "
3991," Thus many of the Jewish residents of Jerusalem read this notice, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was written in Aramaic, Latin, and Greek. ","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich tavrani uqallaŋarut Pilate-mun, Aglagnagu Umialgannik Jew-guruat, aglaan aglagiñ Una iñuk uqaqtuaq uvaŋa Umialguruŋa Jew-guruanun. "
3992," Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The king of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘This man said, I am king of the Jews.’” ","Pilate kiuŋagai, Aglaaġianikkaġa allaŋŋuġniaŋitchuq."
3993," Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.”","Aŋuyaktit Jesus kikiaktuutianikamirruŋ aŋarrauramun, tiguŋagaich annuġaaŋi aasii autaaqługich sisamaigułługich, atautchimik piḷḷaayumiñaqsivḷugu aŋuyakti. Aglaan iḷagiŋaitkaat iḷulliat annuġaaŋisa kiluiḷaaq, qiḷaaq qulaaniñ anmun, "
3994," Now when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and made four shares, one for each soldier, and the tunic remained. (Now the tunic was seamless, woven from top to bottom as a single piece.) ","uqaqłutiŋ inmiŋnun, Aligaŋaiḷḷakput una, aglaan saaptautigilakput iḷitchuġisaġluta kimun piginiaqtilaaŋanik. Taamna taŋŋiutauniqsuq Bible uqaluannun inna,"
3995," So the soldiers said to one another, “Let’s not tear it, but throw dice to see who will get it.” This took place to fulfill the scripture that says, “They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they threw dice.” So the soldiers did these things.","Tavra taamna aŋuyaktit piŋagaat. Aasiivsauq makitaŋarut saniġaani aŋarrauraŋan Jesus, aakaŋa, aakaŋallu aniqataa, Mary-ḷu nuliaŋa Clopas, Mary-ḷu Magdalene. "
3996," Now standing beside Jesus’ cross were his mother, his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. ","Tavra Jesus tautukamiuŋ aakani iḷitchitquraġlu ilaan piviuttaġirani makitaruak qaniłłutiŋ, uqallautiŋagaa aakani, Aġnaaq, ikka iġñiġiñ. "
3997," So when Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing there, he said to his mother, “Woman, look, here is your son!” ","Aasii uqallaŋammiuq iḷitchitquramun, Ikka aakan. Tavraŋŋaaglaan iḷitchitquram nuutinŋagaa ilaan aimaaġviŋmiñun."
3998," He then said to his disciple, “Look, here is your mother!” From that very time the disciple took her into his own home.","Taavruma aquagun Jesus, iḷisimavluni supayaat paŋmapak naatilaaŋannik, uqallaŋaruq, Imiġuliqsuŋa. Taamna uqallausiġiŋagaa taŋŋiquvlugich Bible uqaluŋich. "
3999," After this Jesus, realizing that by this time everything was completed, said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty!” ","Tavrani napaŋaruq qattaq siḷivinŋaruaq wine-mik, tavra iḷiŋagaat ivsaktaqtuaq ivsaktilluataqługu wine-mik aasii isaaġutivlugu qiruatchiamik qanġanun. "
4000," A jar full of sour wine was there, so they put a sponge soaked in sour wine on a branch of hyssop and lifted it to his mouth. ","Jesus aitchuusiaġianikamiuŋ wine uqallaŋaruq, Naattuq. Aasii sikivlugu niaqquni aniġniġiŋaruq."
4001," When he had received the sour wine, Jesus said, “It is completed!” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.","Tavra uvluġimmagu Itqanaiyaġvium Qulaurrusiqivikun niqinaqivium, Jew-guruat apiġiŋagaat Pilate niuŋich navguġukługich, suli aullautitquvlugich, timit aŋarrauraniititquŋił̣ł̣ugich Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋanni. Qanuq taamna Savaiññiq nuimaruaguruq allaniñ Savaiññiġniñ. "
4002," Then, because it was the day of preparation, so that the bodies should not stay on the crosses on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an especially important one), the Jewish leaders asked Pilate to have the victims’ legs broken and the bodies taken down. ","Tavra aŋuyaktit qaiŋarut aasii navguqługik niuŋik sivullium, igḷuatalu kikiaktuurrauqatauruam Jesus-mun. "
4003," So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men who had been crucified with Jesus, first the one and then the other. ","Aasii tikiññamirruŋ Jesus iḷitchuġivlugu tuquaniktilaaŋanik, naviŋaitkaich niuŋik. "
4004," But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. ","Aglaan iḷaŋata aŋuyaktit kapiŋagaa saniqsuagun panamik, aasii tavrauvvaa maqiŋaruk auglu imiġlu. "
4005," But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water flowed out immediately. ","Iñuk taamna tautuŋaruaq taavrumiŋa quliaqtuaŋaruq ilivsi ukpiliquvlusi. Ilaan quliaqtuaŋa iḷumun ittuq, suli ilaa iḷisimaruq iḷumun ittuamik uqaqtilaamiñik. "
4006," And the person who saw it has testified (and his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth), so that you also may believe. ","Tavra tamatkua piŋarut taŋŋiqsautquvlugich Bible uqaluŋich inna, “Atausiuraq-unnii sauniŋa naviktauniaŋitchuq.” "
4007," For these things happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled, “Not a bone of his will be broken.” ","Aasiisuli alla Bible uqaluat uqaġmiuq, “Ilaisa qiñiġniaġaat kapiŋaraqtiŋ.”"
4008," And again another scripture says, “They will look on the one whom they have pierced.”",Taavruma aquagun Joseph Arimathea-ġmium ullakługu Pilate apiġiŋagaa pisukługu timaa Jesus. Taamna Joseph ukpiqtuaguruaq Jesus-mun aglaan nalunautchivḷuni sivuuġagivlugich Jew-guruat. Pilate-gum uqallautiŋagaa piyumiñaġnivḷugu timaa Jesus. Anivḷuni Joseph-gum aullautiyaqtuŋagaa Jesus timaa. 
4009," After this, Joseph of Arimathea, a disciple of Jesus (but secretly, because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate if he could remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, so he went and took the body away. ","Nicodemus-lu, Jesus-mukpaalluŋaruaq unnuami, qaiŋammiuq qaġġirrivḷuni akuvliġiiñik tivluktuaniglu tivraġiksuaniglu iḷuvviuġutinik tallimakipiatun uqumaisigiruanik. "
4010," Nicodemus, the man who had previously come to Jesus at night, accompanied Joseph, carrying a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy-five pounds. ","Iliŋikta piŋagaak timaa Jesus, aasii nimmaaqługu qattiġiksuanik ukił̣haanik tivraġiksausiqł̣ugu, piḷġusiatitun iḷuvviuqamiŋ Jew-guruat. "
4011," Then they took Jesus’ body and wrapped it, with the aromatic spices, in strips of linen cloth according to Jewish burial customs. ",Tavra qaniŋani ilaan kikiaktuurrauviata nauvianni napaaqtut inŋaruq nutaaq iḷuvvivik iñuum qaŋaunnii iḷuvġuvigiŋaisaŋa. 
4012," Now at the place where Jesus was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden was a new tomb where no one had yet been buried. ","Tavra pisigivlugu uvluq sivuani Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋata, pisigivlugulu iḷuvvivium qaninniŋa, iḷiŋagaat Jesus tavruŋa."
4013," And so, because it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they placed Jesus’ body there.",
4014," Now very early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved away from the entrance. ","Tavra Jew-guruat Itchaksriġmata Savaiññiŋat qaaŋiġman, Mary Magdalene iḷuvviviŋmuŋaruq uvlaaġuaqłuni taaŋŋaansuli, aasii tautuŋagaa uyaġagruaq piiŋaruaq iḷuvvivium paaŋaniñ. "
4015," So she went running to Simon Peter and the other disciple whom Jesus loved and told them, “They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we don’t know where they have put him!” ","Tavra aqpamik aullaŋaruq Simon Peter-mun allamullu iḷitchitquramun taavrumuŋa Jesus piviuttaġikkaŋanun, aasii uqallautivlugik, Aullautiniġaat Ataniq iḷuvviviŋmiñ, aasii nalugikput sumun iḷisilaaŋanik. "
4016, Then Peter and the other disciple set out to go to the tomb. ,"Peter tavrani aniŋaruq piqatigivlugu alla taamna iḷitchitquraq, aasii aullaqiŋaruk iḷuvviviŋmun. "
4017," The two were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached the tomb first. ","Iluqatik aqpanŋaruk, aglaan allam iḷitchitquram unitchaŋagaa Peter aasii tikitqaaqłuni iḷuvviviŋmun. "
4018," He bent down and saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, but he did not go in. ","Aasii puuŋasivḷuni itchuaqami qiñiqsaqłuni, tautuŋagai qattiġiksuat ukił̣haat tamaani, aglaan isiŋitchuq. "
4019," Then Simon Peter, who had been following him, arrived and went right into the tomb. He saw the strips of linen cloth lying there, ","Tavra Simon Peter tikiñŋaruq aasii isiqłuni iḷuanun iḷuvvivium. Aasii tautuŋagai qattiġiksuat ukił̣haat tamaaniittuat, "
4020," and the face cloth, which had been around Jesus’ head, not lying with the strips of linen cloth but rolled up in a place by itself. ","ukił̣haaġlu niaquaniinŋaruaq itqatauŋiññiqsuq qattiġiksuanun ukił̣haanun, aglaan imulaaŋavluni inniqsuq inmigun. "
4021," Then the other disciple, who had reached the tomb first, came in, and he saw and believed. ","Tavra alla iḷitchitquraq, tikitqaaŋaruaq iḷuvviviŋmun, isiŋammiuq aasii tautukługich ukpiliŋaruq. "
4022, (For they did not yet understand the scripture that Jesus must rise from the dead.),"Tamauŋanun aglaan kaŋiqsiŋaitkaich Bible uqaluŋich, ilaan aŋiruksrauniŋagun tuqqunmiñ. "
4023, So the disciples went back to their homes. ,Tavra iḷitchitqurak utiŋaruk aimaaġviŋmiŋnun.
4024," But Mary stood outside the tomb weeping. As she wept, she bent down and looked into the tomb. ","Tavrali Mary makitaŋaruq qiavluni siḷataani iḷuvvivium, qianiallaġmi puuŋasivḷuni itchuaŋaruq iḷuvvivium iḷuanun, "
4025," And she saw two angels in white sitting where Jesus’ body had been lying, one at the head and one at the feet. ","aasii tautuŋaruq malġugnik isaġullaŋnik qatiqtuanik annuġaaqaqtuaŋnik, aquppiruaŋnik timaata Jesus nallavigiŋaraani, igḷua niaquani aasii igḷua isigaŋiñi. "
4026," They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” Mary replied, “They have taken my Lord away, and I do not know where they have put him!” ","Iliŋikta apiġiŋagaak, Aġnaaq, summan qiavich? Ilaan kiuŋagik, Atakkiataŋimma aullautiŋaniġaat Ataniġa, aasii nalugiga sumun iliŋiññun iḷisilaaŋanik. "
4027," When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.","Tainna uqallaanikami, kiŋiaŋaruq aasii tautuŋagaa Jesus makitaruaq, aglaan iḷisaġiŋitkaa Jesus-gutilaaŋanik. "
4028," Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Who are you looking for?” Because she thought he was the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him.” ","Jesus apiġiŋagaa, Aġnaaq, summan qiavich?

4029," Jesus said to her, “Mary.” She turned and said to him in Aramaic, “Rabboni” (which means Teacher). ","Jesus tuqłuŋagaa atqanik, Mary. Mary qiviaŋaruq aasii uqallakłuni ilaanun Hebrew-tun, Rabboni (sivuniqaqtuaq Iḷisaurrii). "
4030," Jesus replied, “Do not touch me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father. Go to my brothers and tell them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’” ","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Tiggunaŋa qanuq mayuaniŋaitchuŋasuli Aapamun.

4031," Mary Magdalene came and informed the disciples, “I have seen the Lord!” And she told them what Jesus had said to her.","Mary Magdalene aullaŋaruq aasii uqallautiŋagai iḷitchitquraŋi, Tautuŋagiga Ataniq. Suli quliaqtuaġutiŋagai Jesus uqaluŋiñik."
4032," On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the disciples had gathered together and locked the doors of the place because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.” ","Unnugiaġniŋani taavruma uvlum, tugliani uvlum Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋata, upkuat umiktuŋapkaqługich iḷitchitqurat irvianni, iqsivḷutiŋ Jew-guruanik, Jesus qaiŋaruq aasii makiłłuni akunġannun uqallautivlugich, Tutqiutiqaġitchi. "
4033," When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord. ","Taamna uqallausiġianikamiuŋ, ilaan maniŋagai ilaiññun argagni saniqqaniḷu. Tavra iḷitchitqurat quviatchaŋarut tautukamirruŋ Ataniq. "
4034," So Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, I also send you.” ","Jesus uqallautitqiŋagai, Tutqiutiqaġitchi. Aapavli tiliŋammaŋa, tainnatulli tiligivsi. "
4035," And after he said this, he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy Spirit. ","Taamnaasii uqallausiġianikamiuŋ, aniqsaaġvigiŋagai uqallautivlugich, Ilitqusiġiksuaq aitchuusiaġisiuŋ. "
4036," If you forgive anyone’s sins, they are forgiven; if you retain anyone’s sins, they are retained.”","Uqallautiguvsigik iñuich God-mun suliqutigiŋaiġñiḷugich itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich piḷuutiŋich ukpiliqpata, suliqutigiŋaiqsaurut.

4037," Now Thomas (called Didymus), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came. ","Tavra Thomas, iḷaŋat qulit malġuk, taggisiqaqtuaq igḷuanik Malġim, piiñŋaruq iḷamiñi Jesus qaimman. "
4038," The other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord!” But he replied, “Unless I see the wounds from the nails in his hands, and put my finger into the wounds from the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it!” ","Tavraasii allat iḷitchitqurat uqallautiŋagaat, Tautuŋagikput Ataniq.

4039," Eight days later the disciples were again together in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were locked, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” ","Tallimat piŋasut uvlut pianiŋmata, iḷitchitquraŋi iglumiinŋalgitchut, aasii Thomas itqatauŋaruq.

4040," Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and examine my hands. Extend your hand and put it into my side. Do not continue in your unbelief, but believe.” ","Tavraasii ilaan uqallautiŋagaa Thomas, Iḷḷiuŋ argaiñ uvuŋa suli tautukkich argatka, isaaġutilugiḷḷu argaktin aasii iḷiḷugich saniqsumnun.

4041," Thomas replied to him, “My Lord and my God!” ","Thomas kiuŋagaa Jesus, Ataniiŋ, God-iiŋ. "
4042," Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are the people who have not seen and yet have believed.”","Jesus uqallautiŋagaa, Ukpiliqsutin tautuanikamŋa kisianik. Quviasuglich iñuich tautuŋaitkaluaqłuŋa ukpiliqsuat."
4043," Now Jesus performed many other miraculous signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book. ",Tavra Jesus takkuanni iḷitchitqurat piŋagaluaqtuq iñugiaktuanik allanik aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautinik kiutilaamiñik aglausimaŋitchuanik ukunani makpiġaani. 
4044," But these are recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.","Aglaan makua aglaagurut ilivsi ukpiquvlusi taamna Jesus Christ-gutilaaŋanik, Iġñiŋa God-im, aasii ukpiliġḷusi iñuggutinnaquvlusi ilaan suaŋŋataagun."

4047," To the same apostles also, after his suffering, he presented himself alive with many convincing proofs. He was seen by them over a forty-day period and spoke about matters concerning the kingdom of God. ","Malġukipiani uvluni tuqutauqqaaqłuni tautuktitqataŋaruq inmiñik ilaiññun iñugiaktuani, nalupqinaiqł̣ugu iñuutilaani.

4048," While he was with them, he declared, “Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait there for what my Father promised, which you heard about from me.

4050," So when they had gathered together, they began to ask him, “Lord, is this the time when you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat katinnamiŋ piqatigivlugu Jesus apiġiŋagaat, Ataniiq, paŋmapak isagutipkaġniaqpiuŋ Israel-guruat umialiqaġumiñaqsiḷugich inmiŋni taimanisun?

4051," He told them, “You are not permitted to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority. ","Jesus kiuŋagai, Ilivsi iḷisimaraksrautigiŋitkisi uvlullu piviksrallu Aapam inillaŋaraŋi ilaan ataniġnaqunmigun. "
4052," But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest parts of the earth.” ","Aglaan Ilitqusiġiksuam qaigumi ilivsiññun suaŋŋasiġñiaġaasi quliaqtuaġumiñaqsiḷusi tusaayugaaġiksuanik uvapkun Jerusalem-mi, iluqaaniḷu Judea-mi, Samaria-miḷu, uŋasigñiqsraŋiññullu nunam.

4053," After he had said this, while they were watching, he was lifted up and a cloud hid him from their sight. ","Tavra taapkuniŋa uqautianikkamigich takunnaqtillugich, ilaa mayuurrauŋaruq qiḷaŋmun, suli nuvuyam tautugnaiqsinŋagaa ilaiññiñ. "

4056," Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Mount of Olives (which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away). ","Tavra iḷitchitqurat utiŋarut Jerusalem-mun iġġiuramiñ atiqaqtuamiñ Olives, half-a-mile-tun uŋasiksigiruaq iniqpaŋmiñ. "
4057," When they had entered Jerusalem, they went to the upstairs room where they were staying. Peter and John, and James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas son of James were there. ","Tavra tikiññamiŋ Jerusalem-mun mayuŋarut qiḷaguamun inigikkamiŋnun, Peter-lu John-lu James-lu Andrew-lu Philip-lu Thomas-lu Bartholomew-lu Matthew-lu James-lu iġñiŋa Alphaeus, Simon-lu Zealot-guruaq, Judas-lu iġñiŋa James. "
4058," All these continued together in prayer with one mind, together with the women, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers. ","Taapkua iluqaġmiŋ katitkayuŋarut aŋaiyyuqatigiikł̣utiŋ akulaił̣ł̣ugu, piqatigivlugich aġnat, Mary-ḷu aakaŋa Jesus, aniqatiiŋiḷu. "
4059," In those days Peter stood up among the believers (a gathering of about one hundred and twenty people) and said, ","Uvlut iñukitchuat pianiŋmata kasimaŋarut ukpiqtuat iñugiaktilaaqaqpalliqł̣utiŋ 120, aasii Peter makinŋaruq uqaġukłuni, "
4060," “Brothers, the scripture had to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit foretold through David concerning Judas – who became the guide for those who arrested Jesus – ","Aniqatiit, Bible uqaluŋich nalauttuksrauŋarut Ilitqusiġiksuam uqaqtinmagu David, sivuniġivlugu Judas, aullarriruaq taapkunuŋa tigutaaqsiruanik Jesus-mik.

4063," This became known to all who lived in Jerusalem, so that in their own language they called that field Hakeldama, that is, “Field of Blood.”) ","Suli taamna tusaaŋagaat iluqaġmiŋ iñuich Jerusalem-miittuat, taamna nuna atchiŋagaat uqausiġmiŋni Akeldama, sivuniqaqtuaq Nunaŋanik Augum.)"

4068," Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all. Show us which one of these two you have chosen ","inaŋiutautquvlugu Judas-mun uumani savaurriñiġmi, tiliraunikun qimakkaŋagun, aullaqłuni ilaan iniksraunmiñun. "
4069, to assume the task of this service and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place.” ,Tavra tiguullaivḷutiŋ atiġnik piksraqtaaġiŋagaat Matthias. Tavra Matthias iḷḷatiŋagaat qulit atautchimun tilirauruanun.
4070," Then they cast lots for them, and the one chosen was Matthias; so he was counted with the eleven apostles.",
4071," Now when the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place. ","Tavra uvlua Pentecost-liqivium tikiñman, iluqaġmiŋ ukpiqtuat kasimaŋarut inimi atautchimi. "
4072, Suddenly a sound like a violent wind blowing came from heaven and filled the entire house where they were sitting. ,"Tavraŋŋatchiaq qiḷaŋmiñ qaiŋaruq sukpaluk anuqsraallaviñaqtuatun, aasii immiŋagaa iluqaan igluqpak kasimaviat. "
4073, And tongues spreading out like a fire appeared to them and came to rest on each one of them. ,"Tavra tautuŋarut qiññaqaqtuanik uqqatun igniġnik siamittuanik inmiŋnun, aasii iñullaa aksiuŋagaa uqqatun ittuam. "
4074," All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in other languages as the Spirit enabled them.","Aasii iluqaġmiŋ immiqsauŋarut Ilitqusiġiksuamik, aasii uqaaqsivḷutiŋ allanik uqautchiñik naluramiŋnik, Ilitqusiġiksuam suaŋŋasiġmatiŋ uqaġumiñaqsivḷugich."
4075, Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven residing in Jerusalem. ,"Tavra Jerusalem-mi iñuuniaqtuaqaŋaruq Jew-nik, God-iliqiruanik iñuŋnik, qairuanik nunapayauraniñ. "
4076," When this sound occurred, a crowd gathered and was in confusion, because each one heard them speaking in his own language. ","Tavra tusaakamirruŋ taamna piruaq, iñusalaich katinŋarut atautchimun. Aasii tuavaallaŋarut, qanuq iñullaam tusaaŋagaich ukpiqtuat uqaqtuat ilaisa uqausiḷḷaamiktun. "

4084," But Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them: “You men of Judea and all you who live in Jerusalem, know this and listen carefully to what I say.

4111, You have made known to me the paths of life;,
4112,you will make me full of joy with your presence.’,
4113," “Brothers, I can speak confidently to you about our forefather David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. ",
4114," So then, because he was a prophet and knew that God had sworn to him with an oath to seat one of his descendants on his throne, ",
4115," David by foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was neither abandoned to Hades, nor did his body experience decay. ",
4116," This Jesus God raised up, and we are all witnesses of it. ",
4117," So then, exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he has poured out what you both see and hear. ",
4118," For David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, ",
4119,"‘The Lord said to my lord,",
4120,“Sit at my right hand ,
4121, until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.”’,
4122, Therefore let all the house of Israel know beyond a doubt that God has made this Jesus whom you crucified both Lord and Christ.”,
4123," Now when they heard this, they were acutely distressed and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “What should we do, brothers?” ",
4124," Peter said to them, “Repent, and each one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. ",
4125," For the promise is for you and your children, and for all who are far away, as many as the Lord our God will call to himself.” ",
4126," With many other words he testified and exhorted them saying, “Save yourselves from this perverse generation!” ",
4127," So those who accepted his message were baptized, and that day about three thousand people were added.",
4128," They were devoting themselves to the apostles’ teaching and to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. ",
4129," Reverential awe came over everyone, and many wonders and miraculous signs came about by the apostles. ",
4130," All who believed were together and held everything in common, ",
4131," and they began selling their property and possessions and distributing the proceeds to everyone, as anyone had need. ",
4132," Every day they continued to gather together by common consent in the temple courts, breaking bread from house to house, sharing their food with glad and humble hearts, ",
4133, praising God and having the good will of all the people. And the Lord was adding to their number every day those who were being saved.,
4134," Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the time for prayer, at three o’clock in the afternoon. ",Tavra Peter-lu John-lu aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmuŋaruk aŋaiyyunaqsimman piŋasunuŋman. 
4135," And a man lame from birth was being carried up, who was placed at the temple gate called “the Beautiful Gate” every day so he could beg for money from those going into the temple courts. ",Tavra tavrani aŋaiyyuvikpaum paaqpaŋani atiqaqtuam Piññaġnaqtuamik iñuk inŋaruq pisualaitchuaq aniñiġmiñiñqaŋa.

4136," When he saw Peter and John about to go into the temple courts, he asked them for money. ","Tautukługik Peter-lu John-lu isiqsaqtuak aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, apiqsriŋaruq nagliktuusiaksranik. "
4137," Peter looked directly at him (as did John) and said, “Look at us!” ","Tavra iluqatik takunnaŋagaak, aasii Peter-m uqallautiŋagaa, Qiñiqtiguk. "
4138," So the lame man paid attention to them, expecting to receive something from them. ",Tavra takunnaŋagik niġiukłuni aitchuusiaksramiñik iliŋiŋniñ. 
4139," But Peter said, “I have no silver or gold, but what I do have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, stand up and walk!” ","Tavra Peter-m uqallautiŋagaa, Maniitchuŋa suuramik-unnii, aglaan aitchuġniaġikpiñ pigikkamnik, ataniġnaqutaagun Jesus Christ Nazareth-mium pisuaqugikpiñ. "
4140," Then Peter took hold of him by the right hand and raised him up, and at once the man’s feet and ankles were made strong. ","Tavra Peter-m tiguŋagaa taliqpiagun, aasii makitiłługu. Tavra tavrauvvaa isigaŋi siŋiġñiŋiḷu suaŋŋasiqsauŋarut. "
4141," He jumped up, stood and began walking around, and he entered the temple courts with them, walking and leaping and praising God. ","Aasii minŋiqłuni makinŋaruq, pisuaqłuniḷu, aasii isiqasiqł̣ugik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, pisuaqłuni minŋiqtaqłuniḷu, suli nanġaqługu God. "
4142," All the people saw him walking and praising God, ","Tavra iñupayaat tautuŋagaat pisuaqługu, nanġaġmagulu God, "
4143," and they recognized him as the man who used to sit and ask for donations at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with astonishment and amazement at what had happened to him.","iḷisaġivlugulu taimña aquppisuuruaq nagliktuusiaksrat pisigivlugich Piññaġnaqtuami, Paaqpaŋani aŋaiyyuvikpaum, suli iliŋich kamasupiaġataŋarut iłuaqsiraumman."
4144," While the man was hanging on to Peter and John, all the people, completely astounded, ran together to them in the covered walkway called Solomon’s Portico. ","Iñuk iłuaqsirauruaq tigummipkaqtillugu Peter-miglu John-miglu iñuich iluqaġmiŋ kamasualavlutiŋ aqpamik katinŋarut ilaiññun, taġġisimaaġviŋmi atiqaqtuami Solomon pianik. "
4145," When Peter saw this, he declared to the people, “Men of Israel, why are you amazed at this? Why do you stare at us as if we had made this man walk by our own power or piety? ","Tavra Peter-m tautukkamigich iñuich, uqallautiŋagai, Iñuich Israel-guruasii, Summan kamasuuttaġivisiuŋ taamna? Summan takunnaqpisigut?

4146," The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you handed over and rejected in the presence of Pilate after he had decided to release him. ","God-tiŋata Abraham Isaac-guvlu Jacob-lu, God-iŋata maŋŋuupta kamanaqsiḷiŋagaa kivgani Jesus. Ilivsi aitchuutigiŋagiksi ataniġnaqutiqaqtuanun, pisuŋił̣ł̣ugulu Pilate takkuani, ilaan tigutaaqtauŋaiqsitchukkaluaġmagu. "
4147, But you rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked that a man who was a murderer be released to you. ,"Aasii ilivsi piiḷaaġiŋagiksi Jesus Piḷuutaitchuaq, Nalaunŋaruaġlu, aasii apiqsriaġiłhaaqługu Pilate-mun iñuaqti tigutaaqtauŋaiqsitquvlugu. "
4148," You killed the Originator of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this fact we are witnesses! ",Aasii ilivsi iñuktaġivlugu Iñuggutiqaqtitchiruaq. Aglaan God-im aŋipkaŋagaa tuqqunmiñ. Aasii uvagut tautuŋavlugu quliaqtuaġigikput. 
4149," And on the basis of faith in Jesus’ name, his very name has made this man – whom you see and know – strong. The faith that is through Jesus has given him this complete health in the presence of you all. ","Taamna Jesus taamnauruq ukpiġivlugu ataniġnaqutaa uqautigikkaqput.

4150," And now, brothers, I know you acted in ignorance, as your rulers did too. ","Aasii paŋmapak aniqatiit, iḷisimaruŋa taamna pikkaqsi Jesus-mun, ilivsiḷu umialiŋnasiḷu piŋagiksi naluvlusi. "
4151, But the things God foretold long ago through all the prophets – that his Christ would suffer – he has fulfilled in this way. ,"God-im, sivuani taamna piŋaiñŋaan, uqautigiŋagaa uqaqtimigun iluqaisigun ilaan Christ-ni nagliksaaqtuksraunivḷugu, aasii ilaan taŋŋiqsinŋagaa tainna. "
4152," Therefore repent and turn back so that your sins may be wiped out, ","Isumalitqigitchi, suli God-mun saallusi, ilaan piiġumagai piḷuutisi, "
4153," so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and so that he may send the Messiah appointed for you – that is, Jesus. ","aitchuusiaqaġumausi Ataniġmiñ ilitqutchivsi suaŋŋatiksraŋanik, quviasuunmiglu, suli ilaan tiliyumagaa Jesus Annaurriksraqtaani ilivsiññun. "
4154," This one heaven must receive until the time all things are restored, which God declared from times long ago through his holy prophets. ","Taamna Jesus qiḷaŋmiinniaqtuq tikitchiaġilugu supayaat nutaaġuġniksraŋat, God-im uqausiatun sivuani ilaaguaqtauŋaruatigun uqaqtimigun iŋiḷġaan. "
4155," Moses said, ‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must obey him in everything he tells you. ","Moses uqallaŋaruq inna, “Ataniq God-iksi tilisiñiaqtuq ilivsiññun, uqaqtimik aniqatiivsiññiñ uvamniktauq tilisiŋammatun. Ilivsi naalaġniraksraġigiksi supayaanik uqallautikpasi. "
4156, Every person who does not obey that prophet will be destroyed and thus removed from the people.’ ,"Aasii kiñaliqaa naalaġniŋitchuaq taavruma uqaqtaata God-im uqaluŋiñik piiqsauniaqtuq God-im iñuŋiñiñ, aasii suksraunġiqsauluni.” "
4157," And all the prophets, from Samuel and those who followed him, have spoken about and announced these days. ","Aasiivsauq uqaqtiŋi God-im, taputivlugich Samuel-lu taipkualu iñuuruat aquagun, iluqaġmiŋ uqaluksraqaŋaruat uqautigiŋammigaich makua paŋmapak uvlut. "
4158," You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your ancestors, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed.’ ","God-im unniqsuqłiisiŋi uqaqtimigun ilivsiññun ittut, aasii iḷaŋiutivlusi sivunniuġutiŋiñun God-im maŋŋuuvsiññun, uqallausiġmisun Abraham-mun inna, “Ilivich kiŋunipkun uvaŋa anniqsuġniaġitka iñupayaurat nunami.” "
4159," God raised up his servant and sent him first to you, to bless you by turning each one of you from your iniquities.”","Tavraasii God piksraŋaruq, aasii tilivḷugu kivgani ilivsiññun, sivulliġivlusi anniqsuġukłusi iluqasi isumalitqiksillusi piḷuktuaniñ piḷġusivsiññiñ."
4160," While Peter and John were speaking to the people, the priests and the commander of the temple guard and the Sadducees came up to them, ","Tavra Peter-lu John-lu uqaġataviksillugik iñuŋnun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich, atanauraŋallu aŋaiyyuvikpaum munaqsriŋisa, Sadducees-lu ullaŋagaich, "
4161, angry because they were teaching the people and announcing in Jesus the resurrection of the dead. ,"qanuqpaaŋavlutiŋ pisigivlugu iḷisaurriñiŋat iñuŋnik quliaqtuaġivlugu Jesus aŋiñivḷugu tuqqunmiñ, ukpiġnaqsivḷugu iñuich aŋipkaqtauniaġniŋat tuqqunmiñ. "
4162, So they seized them and put them in jail until the next day (for it was already evening). ,"Tavra tigutaaŋagaich, suli inillakługik tigutaaġviŋmun uvlaakutchiaqsaqługu, unnugruiññaġman. "

4164," On the next day, their rulers, elders, and experts in the law came together in Jerusalem. ","Uvlaakumman Jew-guruat atanauraŋiḷḷu, umialiŋnaŋiḷḷu, iḷisaurriḷḷu pitquranik katinŋarut atautchimun Jerusalem-mi, "

4171," And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”","Tavra uqaqsitaaqtitchirit iḷitchuġikamiŋ Peter-lu John-lu taluqsraŋisilaaŋaŋnik, suli iḷisaŋaisilaaŋaŋnik iñugruiññauvlutiglu, kamasuliŋarut. Tavra iḷitchuġiŋarut piqatauŋatilaaŋaŋnik Jesus-mun. "
4172," When they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and discovered that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and recognized these men had been with Jesus. ","Tavra tautuaġivlugu iñuk iłuaqsirauŋaruaq makitaruaq saniġaaŋni, akiḷḷiḷiqsuutiksraiñŋarut. "
4173," And because they saw the man who had been healed standing with them, they had nothing to say against this. ","Tavra aqpigiqqaaqługik uqaqsitaaġviŋmiñ uqaqatigiirraqsiŋarut avanmun, "
4174," But when they had ordered them to go outside the council, they began to confer with one another, ","uqaqłutiŋ, Qanuġniaqpisigik apkuak iññuk? Qanuq-uvva iñupayaat iñuuruat Jerusalem-mi iḷisimagaat suqpauruaq aliuġnaqtuaq savaaŋak taamapkuak, aasii piiḷaaġiyumiñaitkikput. "
4175," saying, “What should we do with these men? For it is plain to all who live in Jerusalem that a notable miraculous sign has come about through them, and we cannot deny it. ",Aglaan siamitinŋaiqsaġlugu iñuŋnun tavraŋŋaaglaan kiliglavut sivuuġasaaġlugik uqautigiŋaiqulugu Jesus iñuŋmun kimulliqaa. 
4176," But to keep this matter from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name.” ","Tavra ququatqiŋagaich, aasii piraksriqł̣ugik suuramikunnii uqaŋaiquvlugik, iḷisaurriŋaiġḷugiglu Jesus-kun."
4177, And they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. ,"Tavra Peter-vlu John-lu kiuŋagaich, Ilivsiññik isivġiqsiuŋ nalliak nalaunŋatilaaŋa God-im takkuani kamaksrigumnuk, ilivsiññik naagga God-mik. "
4178," But Peter and John replied, “Whether it is right before God to obey you rather than God, you decide, ","Qanuq uqautigiŋaiġumiñaitkikput uvagut uvaptiŋnik tautuŋakkaqput, tusaaŋakkaqpullu. "
4179, for it is impossible for us not to speak about what we have seen and heard.” ,"Tavra uqaqsitaaqtitchirit sivuuġasaavsaaqqaaqługik Peter-lu John-lu aullaqtinŋagaich. Iliŋich iḷitchuġiŋaitchut tatavsautauyumiñaqtuamik iliŋiŋnun, qanuq iñupayaat nanġaŋagaat God taavrumuuna piruakun. "
4180," After threatening them further, they released them, for they could not find how to punish them on account of the people, because they were all praising God for what had happened. ",Taamna iñuk iłuaqsirauruaq aliuġnaqtuakun ukiuqaŋaruq sippiqł̣ugu malġukipiaq.

4182," When they were released, Peter and John went to their fellow believers and reported everything the high priests and the elders had said to them. ","Tavra tusaakamirruŋ taamna, iluqaġmiŋ aŋaiyyuqatigiirraqsiŋarut God-mun, uqallakłutiŋ, Sapiġñaqtuaq Ataniq, savaŋaruatiin qiḷaŋmik, nunamiglu, taġiumiglu, suli supayaanik imaġikkaŋiññik, "
4183," When they heard this, they raised their voices to God with one mind and said, “Master of all, you who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them, ","ilivich David kivgan maŋŋuqput ilitqusiġiksuakkun uqaqtinŋagiñ uqallaŋman inna,"

4190," “For indeed both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, assembled together in this city against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, ",
4191, to do as much as your power and your plan had decided beforehand would happen. ,
4192," And now, Lord, pay attention to their threats, and grant to your servants to speak your message with great courage, ",
4193," while you extend your hand to heal, and to bring about miraculous signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.” ",
4194," When they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God courageously.",
4195," The group of those who believed were of one heart and mind, and no one said that any of his possessions was his own, but everything was held in common. ",
4196," With great power the apostles were giving testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was on them all. ",
4197," For there was no one needy among them, because those who were owners of land or houses were selling them and bringing the proceeds from the sales ",
4198," and placing them at the apostles’ feet. The proceeds were distributed to each, as anyone had need. ",
4199," So Joseph, a Levite who was a native of Cyprus, called by the apostles Barnabas (which is translated “son of encouragement”), ",
4200, sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and placed it at the apostles’ feet.,
4201," Now a man named Ananias, together with Sapphira his wife, sold a piece of property. ","Iñuglivsauq atiqaqtuaq Ananias-mik piqatigivlugu nuliani Sapphira tunisiŋaruk nunaviñiġmik iliŋikta pimiŋnik, "
4202, He kept back for himself part of the proceeds with his wife’s knowledge; he brought only part of it and placed it at the apostles’ feet. ,"aasii nuliani iḷisimapkaqługu tutquqsiŋaruq iḷaŋanik akiata, aasii qaġġirrivḷuni iḷałhiñaŋiñik akiŋata tiliraunikun iḷitchitquranun. "
4203," But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back for yourself part of the proceeds from the sale of the land? ","Tavra Peter-m uqallautiŋagaa, Ananias, summan Satan-mun aŋalatitpich saglutquvlutin Ilitqusiġiksuamun, tutquqtaqaquvlutin iḷaŋanik akiata nunam? "
4204," Before it was sold, did it not belong to you? And when it was sold, was the money not at your disposal? How have you thought up this deed in your heart? You have not lied to people but to God!”","Tuniŋaiñŋaan nunan ilivich pigiŋagiñ. Suli tunianikkaluaqapku maniich ilivich pigimmigitin. Summan-aasii isummiŋavich tainna pisukłutin?

4205," When Ananias heard these words he collapsed and died, and great fear gripped all who heard about it. ",Tavra Ananias tusaapqauraqamigich taapkua uqaluich nusiḷiŋaruq. Suli iñuich iluqatiŋ tusaaruat taavrumiŋa iqsitchaŋarut. 
4206," So the young men came, wrapped him up, carried him out, and buried him. ","Nukatpiat isiŋarut, aasii nimmaaqqaaqługu timaa annisiŋagaat, aasii iḷuviqługu."
4207," After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, but she did not know what had happened. ","Pianikpalliġmata ikarraich piŋasut, nuliaŋa isiŋaruq naluvluni sutilaamik. "
4208," Peter said to her, “Tell me, were the two of you paid this amount for the land?” Sapphira said, “Yes, that much.” ","Tavra Peter uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Uqallautiŋŋa tunigaluapiaqtilaaŋanik nuna tainnatun. Aġnaq uqallaŋaruq. Aaŋ, tavra tainnatun. "
4209," Peter then told her, “Why have you agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out!” ","Tavra Peter uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Qanuqimña atisivḷutik atunim uuktuqpitku Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa Atanġum.

4210," At once she collapsed at his feet and died. So when the young men came in, they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. ","Tavrauvvaa aġnaq ulġuŋaruq sivuġaanun Peter-m, aasii tuquvluni. Nukatpiat isiqamiŋ tautuŋagaat tuquaniktuaq, aasii akigaqługu iḷuviŋammigaat saniġaanun uiŋata. "
4211, Great fear gripped the whole church and all who heard about these things.,Tavra iluqaġmiŋ aŋaiyyuliqiruat allallu iluqaġmiŋ tusaaruat iqsitchapiaġataŋarut.
4212, Now many miraculous signs and wonders came about among the people through the hands of the apostles. By common consent they were all meeting together in Solomon’s Portico. ,Tavra akunġanni iñuich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat piŋarut iñugiaktuanik aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautauruanik uqaluŋmiŋ iḷumun itilaaŋanik.

4213," None of the rest dared to join them, but the people held them in high honor. ","Nalliat-unnii iñuich iḷaliqsuutisausiiñŋaruq ilaiññun, iñuŋnun uqautigilluataġaluaqtillugich. "
4214," More and more believers in the Lord were added to their number, crowds of both men and women. ","Aglaan iñugiaksisaiññaŋarut iñuich iḷaliutiruat ukpiqtuanun, aŋutisalaiḷḷu aġnallu ukpiliqsuat Ataniġmun. "
4215," Thus they even carried the sick out into the streets, and put them on cots and pallets, so that when Peter came by at least his shadow would fall on some of them. ","Pisigivlugu tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat savaaġikkaŋat naŋittuat iñuich akigaŋagaich apqutinun, aasii inillakługich siñigviŋñun ikuvġanullu, Peter tamaunnaaqpan taġġaŋanun-unnii nalautquvlugich iḷaŋich. "
4216," A crowd of people from the towns around Jerusalem also came together, bringing the sick and those troubled by unclean spirits. They were all being healed.","Iñuich-suli katinŋammiut nunaaqqiñiñ avataaniñ Jerusalem, qaġġisivlugich naŋittuat, tamatkualu iłuiḷḷiuġutiqaqtuat ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik, aasii iluqaġmiŋ iłuaqsirauŋarut."
4217," Now the high priest rose up, and all those with him (that is, the religious party of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy. ",Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat piqatiniḷu iluqaġmiŋ iḷauruat Sadducees-nun suammautiŋagaich killuġivlugich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat. Tavra sivunniŋarut qanusiġaġukługich. 
4218, They laid hands on the apostles and put them in a public jail. ,Tavra tigutaaŋagaich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat aasii iḷivḷugich tigutaaqsivikaamun. 
4219," But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the doors of the prison, led them out, and said, ","Taavrumani unnuami isaġulgan Atanġum upkuiŋagai tigutaaġvium paaqpaŋi, aasii annisikamigich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat uqallautiŋagai, "
4220, “Go and stand in the temple courts and proclaim to the people all the words of this life.” ,"Aullaġitchi, aasii makillusi aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi uqautiyaqtuqsigik iñuich mattumuuna nutauruakun iñuggutikun. "
4221," When they heard this, they entered the temple courts at daybreak and began teaching.","Tavra tilirauruat kamaksriŋarut, aasii qausaġataġman isiŋarut aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, aasii iḷisaurriŋarut.

4222,"Now when the high priest and those who were with him arrived, they summoned the Sanhedrin – that is, the whole high council of the Israelites – and sent to the jail to have the apostles brought before them. ","Tavra aŋuyaktit atanauraŋich qaikamiŋ, paqinŋaitkaich tigutaaġviŋmi, aasii uqaqsitaaqtitchiriñun utiqłutiŋ quliaqtuaŋarut. "
4223," But the officers who came for them did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported, ","Paqinŋagikput tigutaaġvik pitchiġiiyautiqapiaqługu, suli qaunaksrit qikaqługich upkuani, aasii aŋmaqaptigu paqinŋitchugut iñuŋmik iḷuani. "
4224," “We found the jail locked securely and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.” ","Tavra atanauraŋata munaqsrich aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu tusaakamiŋ taapkuniŋa qanuqsausiiñŋarut, isumaaluutigivlugu sumun taavruma tikiutiniksraŋa. "
4225," Now when the commander of the temple guard and the chief priests heard this report, they were greatly puzzled concerning it, wondering what this could be. ","Tavra iñuum qaivḷuni uqallautiŋagai, Iñuich tigutaaġviŋmuŋakkasi makitarut aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi iḷisaurrivḷutiŋ iñuŋnik. "
4226," But someone came and reported to them, “Look!

4227, Then the commander of the temple guard went with the officers and brought the apostles without the use of force (for they were afraid of being stoned by the people).,Tavra qaġġisikamisigik inillaŋagaich sivuġaannun uqaqsitaaqtitchirit. Aasii aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata apiqsruqtuŋagai. 
4228," When they had brought them, they stood them before the council, and the high priest questioned them, ","Tavra uqallautiŋagai, Piraksripiaġataŋagaluaġivsi iḷisaurritquŋił̣ł̣usi taavrumuuna Jesus-kun, naaggauvva ilivsi siaminŋagiksi iḷisaurrutiksi iñupayaanun Jerusalem-mi, aasii patchisaupkaqsaqłuta tuqutauniŋagun.

4229," saying, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name. Look, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood on us!” ","Tavra Peter-m tilirauruallu kiuŋagaich, Kamagiraksraġipiaġikput God kamaksriñiġmiñ iñuŋnik. "
4230," But Peter and the apostles replied, “We must obey God rather than people. ","God-iŋata maŋŋuupta aŋipkaŋagaa Jesus tuqqunmiñ, ilivsi tuqutanikavsiuŋ kikiaktuutivlugu aŋarrauramun. "
4231," The God of our forefathers raised up Jesus, whom you seized and killed by hanging him on a tree. ","God-im kamanaqsipkaŋagaa inillakługu taliqpiŋmi tuŋaanun Aullarriġuqługu Annaurriġuqługulu, iñuich Israel-guruat isumalitqikkumiñaqsivḷugich, piḷuutitiŋ suliqutigiŋaiqsaupkaġlugich itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich. "
4232," God exalted him to his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. ","Aasii uvagut iḷisimavlugich iḷumun itilaaŋat quliaqtuaġigivut, uvagullu Ilitqusiġiksuavlu, God-im aitchuutaata tamatkunuŋa kamaksriruanun inmiñik."
4233," And we are witnesses of these events, and so is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey him.”","Uqaqsitaaqtitchirit tusaakamirruŋ taamna, qinnalipiaġataŋarut, suli tuqutchuŋagaich tilirauruat iḷitchitqurat. "
4234," Now when they heard this, they became furious and wanted to execute them. ","Aglaan iḷaŋat Pharisee-guruaq kasimmarririni, atiqaqtuaq Gamaliel-mik, iḷisaurri pitquranik, isumakkusiaqaġluataqtuaq iñupayaaniñ, makinŋaruq aasii piraksriivḷuni tilirauruat annisitquvlugich. "
4235," But a Pharisee whose name was Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the council and ordered the men to be put outside for a short time. ","Aasii uqallautiŋagai uqaqsitaaqtitchirit, Israel-guruasii, qaunagisitchi qanuq aŋalatchisilaavsiññik taapkuniŋa iñuŋnik. "
4236," Then he said to the council, “Men of Israel, pay close attention to what you are about to do to these men. ","Qanuq sivuanni makua uvlut Theudas iñukpalliŋaruq kamanaqsiḷiqłuni inmiñik.

4237," For some time ago Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and nothing came of it. ","Aquagun suli Judas Galilee-ġmiu iñukpalliŋammiuq kisitchipkaqługich iñuŋnik, aasii maliksuktitchivḷuni iḷaŋiññik iñuich inmiñun. Ilaaptauq tuqutauŋammiuq, iluqaġmiglu maliġuaqtiŋi siaminŋarut. "
4238," After him Judas the Galilean arose in the days of the census, and incited people to follow him in revolt. He too was killed, and all who followed him were scattered. ",Tavraasii paŋmapak piruakun uqallautigivsi. Qanuqsaanagich taapkua iñuich. Iḷaksianagich. Taamna sivunniuġun savaaŋallu iñuŋniñ piruagugumi piiġñiaqtuq. 
4239," So in this case I say to you, stay away from these men and leave them alone, because if this plan or this undertaking originates with people, it will come to nothing, ","Aglaan God-miñ piruagukpan, akiiḷiyumiñaipiaġisi. Ilivsiunnii iḷaanni paqitaaguniaqtusi aŋuyaglugu God. "
4240," but if it is from God, you will not be able to stop them, or you may even be found fighting against God.” He convinced them, ","Tavra uqaqsitaaqtitchirit kamagiŋagaat Gamaliel piraksriutaa.

4241, and they summoned the apostles and had them beaten. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus and released them. ,"Tavra iliŋich qimautiŋarut uqaqsitaaqtitchiriniñ, quviasukłutiŋ God-im nalliummatirualiyumiñaġniġmatiŋ nagliksaaġutigiyumiñaqługu kanŋunaqtuakun Jesus. "
4242, So they left the council rejoicing because they had been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the name. ,"Suli uvlutuaġman aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, iñuiḷḷu aimaaġviŋiññi, iḷisaurriŋarut alġaqsruivḷutiglu tusaayugaaġiksuanik Jesus-kun Christ-guruakun."
4243," And every day both in the temple courts and from house to house, they did not stop teaching and proclaiming the good news that Jesus was the Christ.",
4244," Now in those days, when the disciples were growing in number, a complaint arose on the part of the Greek-speaking Jews against the native Hebraic Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution of food. ","Tavra taipkunani uvluni ukpiqtuat iñugiaksimmata, Greek-tun uqausiqaqtuat Jews uqamayuutiqaŋarut Jew-guruanun, uqaqłutiŋ uiḷgaŋaruatiŋ mitchugisuunivḷugich uvlutuaġman autaaġmata. "
4245," So the twelve called the whole group of the disciples together and said, “It is not right for us to neglect the word of God to wait on tables. ","Tavra qulit malġuk tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat ququaŋagaich atautchimun ukpiqtuat, aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Nalaunŋaitchuq uvagut aġiuguptigu alġaqsruiñiq uqaluanik God-im autaaqtausugluta niqinik. "
4246," But carefully select from among you, brothers, seven men who are well-attested, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may put in charge of this necessary task.

4247, But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.” ,Aasiiḷi uvagut atuġniaġikput piviksraqput aŋaiyyuuġniġmun alġaqsruiñiġmullu. 
4248," The proposal pleased the entire group, so they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, with Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch. ","Tavra uqallautaata iviġaŋagaich iluqaisa iñusalaich, aasii piksraqtaaġiŋagaat Stephen, suaŋaruaq ukpiġunmiñi aŋalatiłłuniḷu Ilitqusiġiksuamun.

4250," The word of God continued to spread, the number of disciples in Jerusalem increased greatly, and a large group of priests became obedient to the faith. ","Tavra uqalua God-im siaminŋaruq, suli ukpiqtuat Jerusalem-mi iñugiaksisaiññasugruŋarut, suli iñugiapiaġataqtuat aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich ukpiliŋarut."
4251," Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and miraculous signs among the people. ","Tavra Stephen, ikayuqpakługu God-im suaŋŋanmik, akunġanni iñuich savaŋaruq kamanaqtuanik aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautinik alġaqsruiñiŋan iḷumun itilaaŋanik. "
4252," But some men from the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), both Cyrenians and Alexandrians, as well as some from Cilicia and the province of Asia, stood up and argued with Stephen. ","Tavra iñuich iḷaŋisa akiḷḷiḷiŋagaat iḷauruat aŋaiyyuviŋmun taggisiqaqtuamun Atanġiqsitauruat Iñuich.

4257, For we have heard him saying that Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” ,"Qanuq tusaaŋagikput uqallaŋman taamnagguuq Jesus Nazareth-miu suksraunġiiñiaqtuaq uumiŋa aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmik, suli allaŋŋuġlugich piraġautchich Moses piraksriutiŋi uvaptiŋnun. "
4258, All who were sitting in the council looked intently at Stephen and saw his face was like the face of an angel.,"Tavra takunnapiaġataqługu, iluqaġmiŋ aquppiruat kasimmarriruani tautuŋagaat Stephen kiiñaŋa iḷiruaq isaġulgum kiiñaŋatun."
4259," Then the high priest said, “Are these things true?” ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata apiġiŋagaa Stephen uqallakłuni, Taamna pasikkusian iḷumun itpa? "
4260," So he replied, “Brothers and fathers, listen to me. The God of glory appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran, ","Tavra Stephen uqallaŋaruq, Aniqatiit umialiŋnallu, naalaġnisiŋa. Kamanaqtuaq God niptaŋaruq maŋŋuptiŋnun Abraham-mun iñuumman Mesopotamia-mi, nuunŋaiñŋaan Haran-mun. "
4261," and said to him, ‘Go out from your country and from your relatives, and come to the land I will show you.’ ","Aasii uqallautiŋagaa Abraham, Aullaġiñ nunaŋniñ iḷaŋniḷḷu, aasii aullaġlutin nunamun iḷitchuġipkaġniakkamnun iliŋnun. "
4262," Then he went out from the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. After his father died, God made him move to this country where you now live. ","Tavra Abraham aullaŋaruq nunaŋanniñ Chaldea-ġmiut, aasii iñuuniarraqsivḷuni Haran-mi. Aasii Abraham aapaŋa tuquaniŋman, God-im nuutinŋagaa tavraŋŋa mattumuŋa nunamun paŋmapak iñuuvigikkavsiññun. "
4263," He did not give any of it to him for an inheritance, not even a foot of ground, yet God promised to give it to him as his possession, and to his descendants after him, even though Abraham as yet had no child. ","Naaggauvva ilaan aitchuŋaitkaa kiŋuvaannaktaksramik tavrani, isigagniqtutilaatun-unnii taktilaaqaqtuamik nunamik, aglaan unniqsuqłiivḷugu aitchuutiginiaġnivḷugu ilaanun piġġaktaaġipkaġlugu kiŋuniiŋiñullu aquagun. Tavrani God-im unniqsuqłiimmagu Abraham miqłiqtuiñŋaruq. "
4264," But God spoke as follows: ‘Your descendants will be foreigners in a foreign country, whose citizens will enslave them and mistreat them for four hundred years. ","Innauvva God-im uqallautiŋagaa, Kiŋuniitin tuyuġmiaguniaqtut allami nunami. Tavrani savaktauniaqtut nagliksaaqtitauqpaglutiglu 400 ukiuni. "
4265," But I will punish the nation they serve as slaves,’ said God, ‘and after these things they will come out of there and worship me in this place.’ ","Aglaan tatavsaġniaġitka iñuich savautikkaŋich. Suli taavruma aquagun aullaġniaqtut taavrumaŋŋa nunamiñ, aasii aŋaiyyuvigiluŋa uumani inimi. God tainna uqaŋaruq. "
4266," Then God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and so he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him when he was eight days old, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs. ","Aasii God-im unniqsuqłiikamiuŋ Abraham, piraksriŋagaa nalunaiñŋutchiquvlugich timiŋisigun kiŋuniiŋi iḷisimanaqsisaġlugu iliŋiññun akuqtuqtilaaŋanik taamna unniqsuqłiisaa.

4267," The patriarchs, because they were jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt. But God was with him, ","Tavrali maŋŋuliutiruat killuġivlugu Joseph, tuniŋagaat savaktautquvlugu Egypt-mi, aglaan God-im itqatigiŋagaa. "
4268," and rescued him from all his troubles, and granted him favor and wisdom in the presence of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. ","Suli annautiŋagaa iluqaiññiñ iłuiḷḷiuġutiŋiñiñ. Tavra Joseph Pharaoh-muurraumman umialganun Egypt, God-im iviġaumakkusiamik isumattunmiglu piqaqtinŋagaa. Tavra Pharaoh-m Joseph kavanaliutiŋagaa Egypt-mun, iluqaiññullu igluqatimiñun. "
4269," Then a famine occurred throughout Egypt and Canaan, causing great suffering, and our ancestors could not find food. ","Tavra niqaiḷḷiurraqsiŋarut nagliksaaġnapiaġataqtuamik iluqaani Egypt-miḷu Canaan-miḷu, aasii maŋŋuuvut paqillaiŋarut niqiksramik. "
4270," So when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors there the first time. ","Tavra Jacob tusaakami niqiksraqaqtilaamik Egypt-mi, tiliŋagai maŋŋuuvut sivulliġmi tavruŋa. "
4271," On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers again, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh. ","Aasii ullautitqigmata Joseph iḷitchuġipkaŋaruq inmiñik aŋayuumiñun, suli Pharaoh-m iḷitchuġiŋagai Joseph iḷaŋi. "
4272," So Joseph sent a message and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come, seventy-five people in all. ","Tavra Joseph qanniŋagaa aapani Jacob, uqallautivlugu qitunġaniḷu qaitquvlugich Egypt-mun, iñugiaktilaaŋat 75 iñuich. "
4273," So Jacob went down to Egypt and died there, along with our ancestors, ","Tavra Jacob qitunġaniḷu Egypt-muŋarut. Tavrani aasii tuquŋaruq, maŋŋuuvullu tuquŋammiut. "
4274, and their bones were later moved to Shechem and placed in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a certain sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.,"Aasii timiŋich nuunŋagaich Shechem-mun, aasii iḷuviqługich Abraham tauqsiaŋanun maniŋmiaqługu maŋŋuqaqtuaniñ Hamor-mik."
4275," “But as the time drew near for God to fulfill the promise he had declared to Abraham, the people increased greatly in number in Egypt, ","Tavra God-im unniqsuqłiisini Abraham-mun taŋŋiyasiaqsimmauŋ, maŋŋuuvut iñugiaksiŋarut Egypt-mi. "
4276, until another king who did not know about Joseph ruled over Egypt. ,Tavra umiallitqiŋarut Egypt-mi naluruamik Joseph-mik. 
4277," This was the one who exploited our people and was cruel to our ancestors, forcing them to abandon their infants so they would die. ","Ilaan aŋalataġiŋagai pisaasuġmiaġutikun iñuvut, suli taluqsralliaġivlugich igittaquŋagai miqłiqtuuraŋich aimaaġviŋiññiñ, tuqutquvlugich. "
4278," At that time Moses was born, and he was beautiful to God. For three months he was brought up in his father’s house, ",Tainnaiḷimman Moses aniŋaruq. Iglignaŋaruq miqłiqtuq. Tavra iñukkuksaqtauŋaruq piŋasuni tatqiñi aapami igluani. 
4279," and when he had been abandoned, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. ","Tavra anitaumman aimaaġviŋmiñiñ, paniata Pharaoh-m tiguaŋagaa, aasii iñukkuksaqługu nanmiñiq iġñiġiruatun. "
4280, So Moses was trained in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in his words and deeds. ,"Suli Moses iḷisaurrusiaqaŋaruq iluqaagun isumattutaatigun Egypt-miut, suli sapiġñaqsiŋaruq uqaluŋmiñi savaamiñiḷu."
4281," But when he was about forty years old, it entered his mind to visit his fellow countrymen the Israelites. ",Tavra malġukipiamik ukiunikami sivunniŋaruq takusukługich Israel-guqatini. 
4282," When he saw one of them being hurt unfairly, Moses came to his defense and avenged the person who was mistreated by striking down the Egyptian. ","Tavra tautukługu iḷaŋata Egypt-mium pimaqłuktakkaŋa Israel-guruaq, ikayuġiaŋagaa payyaksaqtuaq, aasii akisautikamiuŋ Egypt-miu tuqunŋagaa. "
4283," He thought his own people would understand that God was delivering them through him, but they did not understand. ","Ilaan isummatigiŋagai aniqatiini kaŋiqsiñasugalugich God-mun atanġiqsinniaġasugalugich inmigun, aasii kaŋiqsiŋiññiqsut. "
4284," The next day Moses saw two men fighting, and tried to make peace between them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers; why are you hurting one another?’ ","Tavrasuli uvlaakumman Moses tautuŋagik malġuk Israel-guruak piyuutiruak, atisitquyumaŋagik uqaqłuni, Aŋutiik, Aniqatigiiksutik. Summan piyuutivisik avanmun? "
4285," But the man who was unfairly hurting his neighbor pushed Moses aside, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us? ","Taavruma pimaqłuktairuam igḷumiñik asivaqtinniaqtuŋagaa Moses uqallautivlugu, Kia atanauraliutivatin isivġiqsiġuqłutillu uvaptiŋnun? "
4286," You don’t want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’ ",Tuqutchukpiŋa iñuaġusiqsun Egypt-miumik ikpaksraq? 
4287," When the man said this, Moses fled and became a foreigner in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.",Moses tusaakami taavrumiŋa pigruŋaruq Egypt-miñ. Suli iñuuniarraqsivḷuni nunami Midian-mi. Tavrani malġugnik iġñiniŋaruq.
4288," “After forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the desert of Mount Sinai, in the flame of a burning bush. ","Tavra malġukipiat ukiut qaaŋiġmata, isaġulik niptaŋaruq Moses-mun igniġmi ikualaruami uqpiŋñi, nunagluktuaŋani Iġġim Sinai-m. "
4289," When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached to investigate, there came the voice of the Lord, ","Moses tautukamiuŋ allayuaġiŋagaa tautuani. Tavra qalliḷaaqsaġataviksillugu uqpiŋñun qiñimmaġiksaaġukługu, tusaaŋagaa Ataniq uqallaktuaq. "
4290," ‘I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses began to tremble and did not dare to look more closely. ","“Uvaŋa God-auruŋa maŋŋuvsiññun, God-iŋa Abraham Isaac-guvlu Jacob-lu.” Tavra Moses uuliksiŋaruq iqsitchakłuni, suli qiñiqsausiiŋagaa. "
4291," But the Lord said to him, ‘Take the sandals off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. ","Tavra Atanġum uqallautiŋagaa, “Atuqalukkiñ piikkik isigaŋniñ, qanuq ini qikaġviiñ God-im nunagigaa. "
4292," I have certainly seen the suffering of my people who are in Egypt and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you to Egypt.’ ","Iḷumutun tautuŋagiga pimaqłuktausiaŋat iñuŋma Egypt-miittuat, suli tusaaŋagiga iiqtuaġutaat, aasii atqaŋaruŋa annautiyaqtuqługich. Aasii paŋmapak qaġġiiñ. Tiliñiaġikpiñ Egypt-mun.”"
4293," This same Moses they had rejected, saying, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge?’ God sent as both ruler and deliverer through the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. ","Taamna Moses pigisuŋisaŋat iñuich Israel-guruat uqaqłutiŋ, Kia atanauraġuqpatin isivġiqsiġuqłutillu uvaptiŋnun? God-im tiliŋagaa atanauraġuqługu annaurriruaġuqługulu ikayuqługu isaġulgum tautuŋakkaŋata ikualaruani uqpiŋñi. "
4294," This man led them out, performing wonders and miraculous signs in the land of Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years. ","Ilaan aullatiŋagai iñuich annisivlugich Egypt-miñ, savakłuni aliuġnaqtuanik nalupqinaiyautinik God-mun itqatigitilaamiñik Egypt-miḷu Red Sea-miḷu nunagluktuamiḷu malġukipiani ukiuni. "
4295," This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, ‘God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers.’ ","Taamnauruq Moses uqaŋaruaq Israel-guruanun, God-im tiliñiaġaa ilivsiññun uqaqtini aniqatiivsiññiñ uvamniktauq tilisimmatun. "
4296," This is the man who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our ancestors, and he received living oracles to give to you. ",Taamna Moses itqatauŋaruq iñuŋnun Israel-guruanun kasimammata nunagluktuami. Ilaa tavraniitqatauŋaruq maŋŋuuptiŋnun isaġuliŋmullu uqaurrimiñun Iġġimi Sinai-mi. Ilaa aitchuusiaqaŋaruq God-miñ qaaŋiqsitaksranik uvaptiŋnun qanuq iñuuruksrautilaaptiŋnik.
4297," Our ancestors were unwilling to obey him, but pushed him aside and turned back to Egypt in their hearts, ","Uvagut maŋŋuupta kamagisuŋiñŋagaat, asivaqsiññaqługu utiġumaliŋarut Egypt-mun. "
4298," saying to Aaron, ‘Make us gods who will go in front of us, for this Moses, who led us out of the land of Egypt – we do not know what has happened to him!’ ","Tavra uqallautiŋagaat Aaron, god-iliuqtigut sivulliuqtiksraptiŋnik, taimña Moses aullarriruaq uvaptiŋnik nunaŋaniñ Egypt nalugikput sutilaaŋanik. "
4299," At that time they made an idol in the form of a calf, brought a sacrifice to the idol, and began rejoicing in the works of their hands. ","Tavra iñuuraqpaliŋarut qiññaqaqługu immulivium nuġġaŋatun, aasii aitchuivḷutiŋ ikipkaunmik taavrumuŋa, suli quviasuuttaġiqpaŋagaat ilimiŋ savaaqtiŋ. "
4300," But God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: ‘It was not to me that you offered slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness, was it, house of Israel? ","Tavrali God-im iḷatchiḷiŋagai, aŋaiyyuyumiñaqsivḷugich uvluġianun qiḷaŋmi. Iñugiaktuat ukiut pianiŋmata uqaqtaa God-im aglaŋaruq uqautigivlugich taapkua iñuich,"
4301," But you took along the tabernacle of Moloch and the star of the god Rephan, the images you made to worship, but I will deport you beyond Babylon.’ ","Tavra Stephen uqavsaaŋaruq.

4302," Our ancestors had the tabernacle of testimony in the wilderness, just as God who spoke to Moses ordered him to make it according to the design he had seen. ",Aquvatigun maŋŋuuptali kiŋuvaaġiŋagaat taamna tupiq aapamiŋniñ. Aasii ilaisa saagaŋagaat aullaqatigikamirruŋ Joshua piññaktaaġikamirruŋ nuna allaniñ nunauruaniñ God-im uŋutaŋiñiñ sivumiŋni.

4303," Our ancestors received possession of it and brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our ancestors, until the time of David. ","David iviġaumagiŋagaa God-iŋata Jacob, aasii ilaan apiġiŋagaa igluqpisukługu. "
4304, He found favor with God and asked that he could find a dwelling place for the house of Jacob. ,Aglaan Solomon-gum igluqpiŋagaa.
4305, But Solomon built a house for him. ,"Aglaattauq kamanaġniqsrauruaq God iñuuviqaŋitchuq igluqpaŋnik iñuich savaaŋiññik uqaqtiŋata God-im uqallausiatun,"
4306," Yet the Most High does not live in houses made by human hands, as the prophet says, ","Tavra iḷauruat uqaqsitaaqtitchiriñun naalaġniruat Stephen-mik, qinnalipiaġataŋarut kigutitiŋ kiggisilaallaisa. "
4307," ‘Heaven is my throne,","Tavrali Stephen, aŋalałługu Ilitqusiġiksuam, takunnaŋaruq qiḷaŋmun, aasii tautukługu qaumanġa God-im, suli Jesus makitaruaq taliqpiata tuŋaani God-im. "

4313," Which of the prophets did your ancestors not persecute? They killed those who foretold long ago the coming of the Righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become! ",
4314," You received the law by decrees given by angels, but you did not obey it.”",
4315," When they heard these things, they became furious and ground their teeth at him. ",
4316," But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently toward heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. ",
4317," “Look!” he said. “I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” ",
4318," But they covered their ears, shouting out with a loud voice, and rushed at him with one intent. ",
4319," When they had driven him out of the city, they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. ",
4320," They continued to stone Stephen while he prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” ",
4321," Then he fell to his knees and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he died. ",
4322, And Saul agreed completely with killing him.,Tavra Saul-gum iviġagiŋagaa tuqutauniŋa.
4323,"Now on that day a great persecution began against the church in Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were forced to scatter throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. ",Tavra taavrumani uvlumi aŋaiyyuliqiruat Jerusalem-mi nagliksaaqtitaurraqsiŋarut.

4324, Some devout men buried Stephen and made loud lamentation over him. ,"God-iliqiruaguruat iñuich iḷuviŋagaat Stephen, suli atqunaq kiŋuvġuŋagaat. "
4325," But Saul was trying to destroy the church; entering one house after another, he dragged off both men and women and put them in prison.","Tavra Saul nagliksaaqtiqpaŋagai aŋaiyyuliqiruat, suli isauġiqł̣ugich iglut, piaqłuktaqługich aullautiŋagai aŋutillu aġnallu tigutaaġviŋmuksimmaisa."
4326, Now those who had been forced to scatter went around proclaiming the good news of the word. ,Tavrali tamatkua ukpiqtuat siamitauruat kukiḷuŋarut alġaqsruutigivlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq. 
4327, Philip went down to the main city of Samaria and began proclaiming the Christ to them. ,"Philip aullaŋaruq iniqpaŋmun Samaria-mun, aasii quliaqtuaġutivlugich iñuich Christ-mik. "
4328," The crowds were paying attention with one mind to what Philip said, as they heard and saw the miraculous signs he was performing. ",Tavra iñusalaich atisivḷutiŋ naalaġniŋarut uqaluŋiñun Philip. Naalaġniŋarut iluqatiŋ tautukługiḷḷu aliuġnaqtuat savaaŋi. 
4329," For unclean spirits, crying with loud shrieks, were coming out of many who were possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed. ","Qanuq ilitqusiqł̣uich aniŋarut iñugiaktuaniñ ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuaniñ nipaalavlutiŋ, suli iñugiaktuat avatiŋich tuquŋaruat tusiattuallu iłuaqsirauŋarut. "
4330, So there was great joy in that city.,Tavra iñuich quviasupiaġataŋarut Samaria-mi.
4331," Now in that city was a man named Simon, who had been practicing magic and amazing the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great. ","Aglaattauq iniqpaŋmi iñuqaŋaruq atiqaqtuamik Simon-mik. Sivuani kamanniuqtitkayuŋniġai aŋatkiqivluni Samaria-ġmiut, inmiñik kamanaqtualivḷuni. "
4332," All the people, from the least to the greatest, paid close attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God that is called ‘Great.’” ","Aasii iluqaġmiŋ iñuich iniqpaŋmi, kamanaiññiqsramiñ kamanaġniqsramun, naalaġnipiaŋagaat, uqaqłutiŋ, Una iñuk suaŋŋasiqsuġaa God-im, iḷisimanaqtuam kamanaqtuamik suaŋŋatiqaqtuam.

4333, And they paid close attention to him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic. ,"Aasii naalaġnisiqaŋarut ilaanun, qanuq sivisuruamik ilaan kamanniuqtinŋagai aŋatkumiñik. "
4334," But when they believed Philip as he was proclaiming the good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they began to be baptized, both men and women. ","Tavraasii ukpiġiliqamirruŋ Philip alġaqsruutaa tusaayugaaġiksuaq atanniqsimmataagun God-im, Jesus-lu Christ-gutilaaŋa, iliŋich paptaiqsauŋarut, aŋutillu aġnallu. "
4335," Even Simon himself believed, and after he was baptized, he stayed close to Philip constantly, and when he saw the signs and great miracles that were occurring, he was amazed.","Simon unnii ilaa ukpiliŋaruq, aasii paptaiqsauqqaaqłuni Philip nayuŋagaa. Suli qiñiqługich kamanaqtuat aliuġnaqtuat Philip piraŋi, ilaa kamanniuŋaruq."
4336," Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them. ","Tavra tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat Jerusalem-miittuat tusaakamiŋ Samaria-ġmiunun akuqtuġnivḷugu uqalua God-im, tiliŋagaich taamuŋa Peter-lu John-lu. "
4337, These two went down and prayed for them so that they would receive the Holy Spirit. ,Taapkuak tikiññamiŋ aŋaiyyutiŋagaich ukpiqtuat aitchuusiaqaquvlugich Ilitqusiġiksuamik. 
4338," (For the Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.) ","Qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuaq iḷuannuŋaitchuq nalliataunnii, aglaan paptaiqsaugiññaŋaniqsut atqagun Atanġum Jesus. "
4339," Then Peter and John placed their hands on the Samaritans, and they received the Holy Spirit.","Tavra Peter-vlu John-lu iḷiŋagaich argatiŋ ilaiññun, aasii iliŋich aŋalarraqsiŋagai Ilitqusiġiksuam."
4340," Now Simon, when he saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, offered them money, ","Tavra Simon, tautukamiuŋ Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalattaġillaniġmagich iñuich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat iḷimmatigik argatiŋ, ilaan mannitchuumaŋagik Peter-lu John-lu, "

4344," Therefore repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that he may perhaps forgive you for the intent of your heart. ","Isumalitqigiñ taavrumaŋŋa pigiitchuamiñ sivunniutiŋniñ, aŋaiyyulutillu Ataniġmun, ilaanun suliqutigiŋaiqulugu pigiitchuakun sivuniqaġniġiñ. "

4347," So after Peter and John had solemnly testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, proclaiming the good news to many Samaritan villages as they went.","Tavra uqalugaaġutigianikamitku uqautigivlugulu uqalua Atanġum, Peter-lu John-lu utiŋaruk Jerusalem-mun. Alġaqsruutigiŋagaak tusaayugaaġiksuaq iñugiaktuanun nunaaqqiŋiññun Samaria-ġmiut."
4348," Then an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south on the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (This is a desert road.) ","Tavrali isaġulga Atanġum uqallaŋaruq Philip-mun, Itqanaiġiñ aullaġuglutin uŋallam tuŋaanun apqutinun Jerusalem-miñ Gaza-mun. Taamna apqun nunagluktuakun. "
4349," So he got up and went. There he met an Ethiopian eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasury. He had come to Jerusalem to worship, ","Tavra Philip itqanaiyaqłuni aullaŋaruq. Ethiopia-ġmiu eunuch-guruaq, suġautchiqiri iglauniqsuq aiñmun.

4350," and was returning home, sitting in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah. ",aasii aisaġniqsuaq tuttuqpiraunmiñi aksraliktuani usiaqsiqł̣uni. Usiaqsiḷḷaġmi taiguaġniqsuaq uqaqtaata God-im Isaiah-m makpiġaaŋiñiñ. 
4351," Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go over and join this chariot.” ","Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallautiŋagaa Philip, Ullaguŋ piqasiuttuiñ uumuŋa tuttuqpirautinik aksraliktuaġaqtuamun. "
4352," So Philip ran up to it and heard the man reading Isaiah the prophet. He asked him, “Do you understand what you’re reading?” ","Tavra Philip aqpanŋaruq, aasii tusaavlugu taiguaqtuaq makpiġaaŋiñiñ Isaiah-m uqaqtaata God-im. Tavra ilaan apiġiŋagaa, Kaŋiqsivich taiguakkaġnik? "
4353," The man replied, “How in the world can I, unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. ","Ilaan kiuŋagaa, Qanuġluŋa kaŋiqsiñiaqpik iñuum iḷisautiŋisuaqpaŋa? Tavra aiyugaaŋagaa Philip mayuġlugu aquptaaqatigitquvluni. "
4354, Now the passage of scripture the man was reading was this:,"Tavra uqaluuraq Bible uqaluat taiguaġinikkaŋa uumiŋauniqsuq,"
4355,"“He was led like a sheep to slaughter,","Tavra suġautchiqirim uqallautiŋagaa Philip, Uqautiŋŋa kimik uqaqtaa God-im uqautiqaqpa? Uqautigiva inmiñik, naagga alla iñuk uqautigivauŋ? "
4356,"and like a lamb before its shearer is silent,","Tavra Philip uqarraqsiŋaruq, aasii aullaqisaaġivlugu taamna Bible uqaluat ilaan quliaqtuaġutiŋagaa tusaayugaaġiksuanik Jesus-kun. "
4357,so he did not open his mouth.,"Tavra iglauniallaġmiŋ apqutitigun tikiñŋaruk imaqsuŋmun, aasii suġautchiqiri uqallaŋaruq, Tautuguŋ, uvva imiq. Sumik piñaiḷutaqaġumiñaqpik paptaiqsauniksrapkun? "
4358, In humiliation justice was taken from him.,"[Tavra Philip uqallaŋaruq, Ukpiġuvich iluqaaniñ uummatiŋniñ paptaiqsauyumiñaqtutin. Aasii ilaan kiuŋagaa uqallakłuni, Ukpiqtuŋa Jesus Christ Iġñiġitilaaŋanik God-mun.] "
4359,Who can describe his posterity?,"Tavra suġautchiqirim nutqaqtitquŋagai tuttuqpirautit aksraliktuani, aasii iluqatik atqaqłutik imiġmuŋaruk Philip-lu suġautchiqirilu, aasii Philip-gum paptaiŋagaa. "
4360,For his life was taken away from the earth.”,"Tavra qakimmaŋnik imiġmiñ Ilitqusiġiksuaŋata Atanġum aullautiŋagaa Philip, aasii suġautchiqirim taututqiŋaitkaa tavraŋŋa, aasiiḷi suġautchiqiri aullaŋaruq iglauyaamigun quviasukpakłuni. "
4361," Then the eunuch said to Philip, “Please tell me, who is the prophet saying this about – himself or someone else?” ","Tavra Philip iḷitchuġikami Ashdod-mi itilaamiñik, tamaunnaaqami alġaqsruutigiŋagaa tusaayugaaġiksuaq nunaaqqipayaanun tikiḷġataqłuni Caesarea-mun."
4362," So Philip started speaking, and beginning with this scripture proclaimed the good news about Jesus to him. ",
4363," Now as they were going along the road, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, “Look, there is water! What is to stop me from being baptized?” ",
4364," So he ordered the chariot to stop, and both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and Philip baptized him. ",
4365," Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him any more, but went on his way rejoicing. ",
4366," Philip, however, found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through the area, he proclaimed the good news to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.",
4367," Meanwhile Saul, still breathing out threats to murder the Lord’s disciples, went to the high priest ","Tavra Saul sivuuġasaaqłipiaŋaruq suli tuquġaaġukługich ukpiqtuat Ataniġmun. Tavra ilaa aullaŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannun, "
4368," and requested letters from him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any who belonged to the Way, either men or women, he could bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem. ","aasii apiqsrivḷuni tuyuutinik, iḷitchuqqutiksranik kiutilaamiñik Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviŋiññi Damascus-mi.

4369," As he was going along, approaching Damascus, suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him. ","Tavra iglauniaqtillugu qallivḷuni Damascus-mun, tavraŋŋatchiaq qaummaq qiḷaŋmiñ qaummaatinŋaruq avataanun. "
4370," He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” ","Aasii Saul ulġuŋaruq nunamun, suli tusaaŋaruq nipimik uqallaktuamik inmiñun, Saul, Saul, summan nagliksaaqtitpiŋa? "
4371," So he said, “Who are you, Lord?” He replied, “I am Jesus whom you are persecuting! ","Tavra Saul apiqsriŋaruq, Kiuvich ququularuatin uvamnik? Aasiiḷi ilaan kiuŋagaa, Uvaŋa Jesus-guruŋa, nagliksaaqtitan. [Nagliksautiksriuqsiññaqtutin iliŋnun akiḷḷiḷiqsuqamŋa.] "
4372, But stand up and enter the city and you will be told what you must do.” ,"Makittin, aasii aullaġlutin iniqpaŋmun, uqallautiniaġaatin suruksrautilaaġnik. "
4373," (Now the men who were traveling with him stood there speechless, because they heard the voice but saw no one.) ","Aŋutit iglauqatiŋi Saul makitaŋarut nutqaŋavlutiŋ uqallaġniaġnatiŋ, tusaqsraġivlugu nipi aglaan tautulaił̣ł̣utiŋ iñuŋmik. "
4374," So Saul got up from the ground, but although his eyes were open, he could see nothing. Leading him by the hand, his companions brought him into Damascus. ","Saul makinŋaruq nunamiñ, aasii uiññami tautuksiḷaiñŋaruq sumik. Tavra tasirriutiŋagaat aasii tikiutivlugu Damascus-mun. "
4375," For three days he could not see, and he neither ate nor drank anything.","Tavraasii piŋasuni uvluni tautuksiḷaiñŋaruq, niġiḷaiñmiuq imilaił̣ł̣uniḷu."
4376," Now there was a disciple in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, “Ananias,” and he replied, “Here I am, Lord.” ","Tavra ukpiqtuaq inŋaruq Damascus-mi atiqaqtuaq Ananias-mik. Atanġum tuqłuŋagaa atqanik qiñiqtuuraakun, Ananias. Aasii ilaan kiuŋagaa, Uvaniittuŋa, Ataniiq. "
4377," Then the Lord told him, “Get up and go to the street called ‘Straight,’ and at Judas’ house look for a man from Tarsus named Saul. For he is praying, ","Tavra Atanġum uqallautiŋagaa, Makillutin aullaġiñ apqugaatchianun atiqaqtuanun Sivukkiruanik, aasii apiqsriḷutin igluani Judas iñuŋmik Tarsus-miumik, atiqaqtuamik Saul, qanuq ilaa aŋaiyyuuqtuq. "
4378, and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and place his hands on him so that he may see again.” ,"Aasii qiñiqtuuraakun tautuaniŋagaa iñuk atiqaqtuaq Ananias-mik isiqtuaq, aasii iḷivḷugich argaŋni ilaanun ilaa tautullasitqiquvlugu. "
4379," But Ananias replied, “Lord, I have heard from many people about this man, how much harm he has done to your saints in Jerusalem, ","Tavra Ananias-gum kiuŋagaa, Ataniiq, tusaaŋaruŋa iñugiaktuaniñ iñuŋniñ taavrumuuna iñukun, qanutun pigiisigiruamik savaaġiŋakkaŋanik ukpiqtuanun Jerusalem-mi. "
4380, and here he has authority from the chief priests to imprison all who call on your name!” ,Aasii qaiŋaruq Damascus-mun ataniġnaqusiraqłuni aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋniñ qiḷiqsruiyumiñaġukługich iluqaisa ukpiqtuat iliŋnun. 
4381," But the Lord said to him, “Go, because this man is my chosen instrument to carry my name before Gentiles and kings and the people of Israel. ","Tavra Ataniq uqallaŋaruq ilaanun, Aullaġiñ, qanuq uvaŋa piksraqtaaġiŋagiga savautitquvluŋa, iḷitchuġipkaquvluŋa Jew-guŋitchuanun, umialiŋnullu, Israel-guruanullu. "
4382, For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name.” ,Qanuq iḷisautiniaġiga qanutupayauraq nagliksaaqtuksrautilaaŋa pisigiluŋa.
4383," So Ananias departed and entered the house, placed his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came here, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” ","Tavra Ananias aullaŋaruq, aasii isiqłuni iglumun.

"
4384," Immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized, ","Aasii tavrauvvaa sutkiaq kavitchisun ittuat kataŋarut Saul-gum irraŋniñ, aasii qiñillasitqiŋaruq. Tavra makinŋaruq aasii paptaiqsauvluni, "
4385," and after taking some food, his strength returned.",suli niġiŋaruq aasii sayanitqikł̣uni. Tavra iñugiaktuani uvluni piqatigiŋagai ukpiqtuat Damascus-mi.
4386,"For several days he was with the disciples in Damascus, ","Tavra Saul aŋaiyyuliaqsautigillaan piŋaruq Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviŋiññun. Aasii alġaqsruutigirraqsiŋagaa Jesus, Iġñiġinivḷugu God-mun. "
4387," and immediately he began to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “This man is the Son of God.” ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ tusaaruat ilaanik niġiiḷḷaqtauŋarut, aasii uqaqłutiŋ, Taimñauŋitpauna iñuk Jerusalem-mi tuquġairuaq ukpiqtuanik Jesus-mun?

4388," All who heard him were amazed and were saying, “Is this not the man who in Jerusalem was ravaging those who call on this name, and who had come here to bring them as prisoners to the chief priests?” ",Tavra Saul alġaqsruiŋaruq suaŋasisaiññaqługu alġaqsruutini. Aasii ilaan ukpiġnaqsilġutiŋi Jesus Christ-guniŋagun suaŋavaił̣ł̣utiŋ Jew-guruat Damascus-miittuat kiumalaiñŋagaat. 
4389," But Saul became more and more capable, and was causing consternation among the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus is the Christ.","Iñugiaktuat uvlut qaaŋianiŋmata, Jew-guruat katinŋarut sivunniuqłutiŋ tuqutchukługu Saul. "
4390," Now after some days had passed, the Jews plotted together to kill him, ","Tavra sivunniuġutaat iḷitchuġiŋagaa Saul-gum. Aasii taapkua iñuaġuktuat qaunagiŋagaich paaqpaich uvlumi unnuamiḷu, tuqutchukługu Saul. "
4391, but Saul learned of their plot against him. They were also watching the city gates day and night so that they could kill him. ,"Tavra unnuat iḷaŋanni, ukpiliqsuat Saul alġaqsruimman, niŋinŋagaat Saul siḷataatigun katchich niŋirrusiqł̣ugu aguummakpaŋmik."
4392, But his disciples took him at night and let him down through an opening in the wall by lowering him in a basket.,"Tavra Saul aullaŋaruq Jerusalem-mun, aasii iḷḷatisaŋagaluaqtuq ukpiqtuanun. Iliŋisa arguagiŋagaat ukpiqtuaġuqtilaaŋa, suli iluqaġmiŋ iqsigiŋagaat. "
4393," When he arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to associate with the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, because they did not believe that he was a disciple. ","Tavra Barnabas qaivḷuni ikayuŋagaa Saul, aasii tiliraunikun iḷitchitquranuutivlugu. Ilaan quliaqtuaġutiŋagai Saul-mun tautuŋatilaaŋanik Ataniq apqunmi, qanuġlu Atanġum uqaŋatilaaŋanik Saul-mun. Barnabas quliaqtuaġutiŋammigai qanutun qikkisaił̣ł̣uni Saul alġaqsruiŋatilaaŋanik alġaqsruutigivlugu Jesus Damascus-miuni. "
4394," But Barnabas took Saul, brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the road, that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken out boldly in the name of Jesus. ","Tavra Saul nayuŋagai, aasii kukiḷukłuni iluqaani Jerusalem-mi, "
4395," So he was staying with them, associating openly with them in Jerusalem, speaking out boldly in the name of the Lord. ","alġaqsruutigivlugu Ataniq qikkisaił̣ł̣uni. Suli uqaaqatigivlugich Greek-gich uqausiqaqtuat Jew-guruatun, ilaisaliasii tuqurviksraqsiuŋagaat. "
4396," He was speaking and debating with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were trying to kill him. ","Tavra aniqatit iḷitchuġikamiŋ taavrumiŋa, aullautiŋagaat Saul Caesarea-mun, aasii tavraŋŋa aullaqtiłługu Tarsus-mun. "
4397," When the brothers found out about this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqiruat iluqaani Judea-mi Galilee-miḷu Samaria-miḷu tutqiksiŋarut, suli aŋaiyyuliqiruat suaŋasisaiññaŋarut iñugiaksisaiññaqłutiglu iñuuvlutiŋ qiksigivlugu Ataniq, quviasaaġutaaniḷu Ilitqusiġiksuam."
4398," Then the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria experienced peace and thus was strengthened. Living in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, the church increased in numbers.","Tavra Peter iglauŋaruq sumulliqaa, aasii iḷaanni ullaŋagai God-im iñuŋi iñuuruat Lydda-mi nunaaqqimi. "
4399," Now as Peter was traveling around from place to place, he also came down to the saints who lived in Lydda. ","Tavrani kasuŋagaa iñuk atiqaqtuaq Aeneas-mik, makitilaiñŋaniqsuaq tallimat piŋasuni ukiuni avatiŋi tuquŋavlutiŋ. "
4400, He found there a man named Aeneas who had been confined to a mattress for eight years because he was paralyzed. ,"Tavra Peter-m uqallautiŋagaa, Aeneas, Jesus Christ iłuaqsigaatin. Makittin iłuaqsakkich tuŋiutitin. Tavra tavrauvvaa makinŋaruq. "
4401," Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Get up and make your own bed!” And immediately he got up. ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ iñuuruat Lydda-mi Sharon-miḷu tautuŋagaat, aasii iliŋich ukpiliŋarut Ataniġmun."
4402," All those who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.",Tavra Joppa-miinŋaruq ukpiqtuaq aġnaq atiqaqtuaq Tabitha-mik. Atqa Greek-tun Dorcas sivuniqaqtuaq tuttumik. Iluqaan piviksrani atuŋaniġaa nakuurualiqivluni ikayuqługiḷḷu iḷiappauruat. 
4403, Now in Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha (which in translation means Dorcas). She was continually doing good deeds and acts of charity. ,"Taipkunani uvluni naŋiliŋaruq aasii tuquvluni, tavraasii timaa ivvaanikamirruŋ iḷiŋagaat qiḷaguamun. "
4404," At that time she became sick and died. When they had washed her body, they placed it in an upstairs room. ","Tavra Joppa qaninman Lydda-mun, ukpiqtuat Joppa-mi tusaaŋarut Peter Lydda-miitilaaŋanik. Tavra tilisiŋarut malġugnik iññuŋnik Peter-mun uqaluksriqł̣ugik inna, Qilamik ullaktigut. "
4405," Because Lydda was near Joppa, when the disciples heard that Peter was there, they sent two men to him and urged him, “Come to us without delay.” ","Tavra Peter itqanaiyaŋaruq, aasii aullaqatigivlugik.

4406," So Peter got up and went with them, and when he arrived they brought him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him, crying and showing him the tunics and other clothing Dorcas used to make while she was with them. ","Tavra Peter-m aninŋagai iluqaisa, aasii sitquqłuni aŋaiyyuŋaruq. Tavraasii qiviaqługu timaa uqallaŋaruq, Tabitha, makittin. Tavra uiñŋaruq, aasii Peter tautukamiuŋ aquvinŋaruq. "
4407," But Peter sent them all outside, knelt down, and prayed. Turning to the body, he said, “Tabitha, get up.” Then she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up. ","Tavra Peter-m isaaqłuni ikayuŋagaa makinman. Tavraniasii ququaqługich ukpiqtuallu uiḷgaŋaruallu, ilaan qaiñŋagaa iñuuvlugu. "
4408, He gave her his hand and helped her get up. Then he called the saints and widows and presented her alive. ,"Tavra taamna iḷitchuġirauŋaruq iluqaani Joppa-mi, suli iñugiaktuat iñuich ukpiliŋarut Ataniġmun. "
4409," This became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. ","Tavra Peter uvliuŋaruq Joppa-mi, tukkuġivlugu Simon qitummairi ammiñik."
4410," So Peter stayed many days in Joppa with a man named Simon, a tanner.",
4411," Now there was a man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort. ","Caesarea-mi iñuqaŋaruq atiqaqtuamik Cornelius-mik, atanaurauniqsuaq Rome-miut aŋuyaktiŋiññun, taggisiqaqtuanun Italian-nik aŋuyaktauqatigiiñik. "
4412," He was a devout, God-fearing man, as was all his household; he did many acts of charity for the people and prayed to God regularly. ","Taamna Cornelius god-iliqiruaguruaq, suli ilaalu qitunġaniḷu qiksigivlugu God. Ilaa ikayuiŋaruq atqunaq Jew-guruat iḷiappaŋiññik, suli ataramik aŋaiyyuvluni God-mun. "
4413," About three o’clock one afternoon he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God who came in and said to him, “Cornelius.” ","Piŋasunukpalliġman qiñiqtuuraaŋaruq tautupiaġataqłuni isaġulganik God-im isiqtuamik, aasii ququaqługu, Cornelius. "
4414," Staring at him and becoming greatly afraid, Cornelius replied, “What is it, Lord?” The angel said to him, “Your prayers and your acts of charity have gone up as a memorial before God. ","Tavra takunnaakkiutiŋagaa isaġulik iqsiḷḷaġmi, aasii uqallakłuni, Suna Ataniiq. Isaġulgum kiuŋagaa, God-im akuqtuŋagai aŋaiyyutitin, savaatillu nagliktuiñikun, suli itqaŋagaatin. "
4415," Now send men to Joppa and summon a man named Simon, who is called Peter. ","Aasii paŋmapak tilisiiñ iñuŋnik Joppa-mun, aasii qaġġisipkaġlugu Simon atiqaqtuaq Peter-mik. "
4416," This man is staying as a guest with a man named Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea.” ","Ilaa amma tukkumaruq Simon-mi qitummairimi ammiñik, igluqaqtuaq taġium siñaani. "
4417," When the angel who had spoken to him departed, Cornelius called two of his personal servants and a devout soldier from among those who served him, ","Isaġulik uqaurriñi aullaaniŋman, Cornelius ququaŋagik malġuk kivgami iḷaŋich, god-iliqiruaguruaġlu aŋuyakti akunġanniñ tamatkua savaurriruat inmiñik, "
4418," and when he had explained everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.","aasii quliaqtuaġutianikamigich supayaamik, ilaan tiliŋagai Joppa-mun."
4419," About noon the next day, while they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up on the roof to pray. ","Uvlaakumman qitiqqaqpalliġman, iglaupkaqtillugich qallivḷutiŋ Joppa-mun, Peter mayuŋaruq iglum qaaŋanun aŋaiyyuyaqtuqłuni. "
4420," He became hungry and wanted to eat, but while they were preparing the meal, a trance came over him. ",Tavra Peter kaaliqł̣uni niġisuliŋaruq. Tavra niqłiuġataviksillugich ilaa qiñiqtuuraaŋaruq. 
4421," He saw heaven opened and an object something like a large sheet descending, being let down to earth by its four corners. ","Aasii tautukługu qiḷak aŋmaqtuaq, sunalu niŋiruaq qiññaqaqłuni ukił̣haaqpaktun, niŋitaŋat sisamatigun kaŋiġalluŋisigun nunamun. "
4422, In it were all kinds of four-footed animals and reptiles of the earth and wild birds. ,Iḷuani imaġiniġai qanusipayaat nunam niġrutiŋi paamġuqtuallu tiŋmiallu. 
4423," Then a voice said to him, “Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat!” ","Tavra nipim nivliutiŋagaa, Peter makittin. Tuqutchiḷutin niġġiiñ. "
4424," But Peter said, “Certainly not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything defiled and ritually unclean!” ","Tavra Peter uqallaŋaruq, Naagga Ataniiq. Niġiŋaitchuŋa qaŋaunnii supayaamik God-im salumaiññiraŋanik pitqurani. "
4425," The voice spoke to him again, a second time, “What God has made clean, you must not consider ritually unclean!” ","Tavra nipim nivliutitqiŋagaa igḷuani, Sut God-im salummaanikkaŋi, isummatiginagich salumaitchuagulugich. "
4426," This happened three times, and immediately the object was taken up into heaven.","Taamna niŋiraġaŋaruq piŋasuiqsuaqłuni, aasii taamna mayuurrauŋaruq tavrauvvaa qiḷaŋmun."
4427," Now while Peter was puzzling over what the vision he had seen could signify, the men sent by Cornelius had learned where Simon’s house was and approached the gate. ","Tavra Peter isumalġataviksillugu sumik sivuniqaġniaqtilaaŋanik qiñiqtuuraani, taapkuali iñuich tilirautiŋi Cornelius, apiqsruqtuiqqaaqłutiŋ Simon iglua sumiitilaaŋanik, makitaŋarut sivuġaani paaqpaum.

4428," They called out to ask if Simon, known as Peter, was staying there as a guest. ",Quqquaŋarut tatqamuŋa apiqsrivḷutiŋ Simon taggisiqaqtuaq Peter-mik tukkumammagaan tavrani. 
4429," While Peter was still thinking seriously about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look! Three men are looking for you. ","Tavra Peter isumalaaġutiqaqtillugu qiñiqtuuraamik, Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallautiŋagaa, Iñuich qaŋma piŋasut ivaġaatin. "

4431," So Peter went down to the men and said, “Here I am, the person you’re looking for. Why have you come?” ","Tavra Peter atqaŋaruq, aasii uqallautivlugich, Uvaŋauruŋa ivakkaqsi. Suvlusi qaivisi? "
4432," They said, “Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to summon you to his house and to hear a message from you.” ","Iliŋisa kiuŋagaat, Cornelius aŋuyaktit atanauraŋata tiliŋagaatigut.

4435, The following day he entered Caesarea. Now Cornelius was waiting anxiously for them and had called together his relatives and close friends. ,"Tavra Peter isiaqsimman Cornelius-gum paaŋagaa, aasii purvigiŋagaa qiksiqsrautikun. "
4436," So when Peter came in, Cornelius met him, fell at his feet, and worshiped him. ","Tavrali Peter-m makitinŋagaa uqallakłuni, Makittin. Uvaŋaptauq iñuk iliktun. "
4437," But Peter helped him up, saying, “Stand up. I too am a mere mortal.” ","Tavra uqaqatigillaan isiŋaruk, aasii tautuŋagai iñugiaktuat iñuich kasimaruat. "
4438," Peter continued talking with him as he went in, and he found many people gathered together. ","Tavraasii Peter-m uqallautiŋagai, Ilivsivsauq iḷisimalluataqtusi qanuq nalaunŋaisilaaŋanik pitquratigun Jew-guruaq piqasiqsuutikpan naagga isiqattaaqpan Jew-guŋitchuamun, aglaan uvva God-im iḷisautiŋagaaŋa isummatigitquŋił̣ł̣ugu iñupayaaq salumaiḷḷugu suuvigruaŋiññiḷugulu. "
4439," He said to them, “You know that it is unlawful for a Jew to associate with or visit a Gentile, yet God has shown me that I should call no person defiled or ritually unclean. ","Tavra qanniġñiqamŋa, qaiŋaruŋa qapiŋŋataił̣ł̣uŋa, aasii apiġigikpiñ paŋmapak, suna pisigivlugu qanniqpiŋa?"
4440," Therefore when you sent for me, I came without any objection. Now may I ask why you sent for me?” ","Tavra Cornelius uqallaŋaruq, Piŋasut uvlut pianiktut, ikarraq tainnaiḷivalliġman aŋaiyyuruaŋaa iglumni. Tavrauvvaa iñuk makinŋaruq sivuqqamnun qaummaġiksuanik annuġaalik, "
4441," Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, at three o’clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my house, and suddenly a man in shining clothing stood before me ","uqallakłuni, Cornelius, aŋaiyyutin God-im tusaaŋagaa, suli itqaqługich savaatin nagliktuutit. "
4442," and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your acts of charity have been remembered before God. ","Tilisiiñ iñuŋmik Joppa-mun, aasii apiqsriaġilugu Simon taggisiqaqtuaq Peter-mik. Tukkumaruq amma taġium siñaaniittuami igluani Simon qitummairim ammiñik. "
4443," Therefore send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter. This man is staying as a guest in the house of Simon the tanner, by the sea.’ ","Tavra aipkaŋagikpiñ tavrauvvaa, aasii nagliktauvlutin qairutin. Paŋmapak uvva iluqata uvaniittugut takkuani God-im, naalagukłuta iluqaiññik uqaluksriusiaġnik Ataniġmiñ."
4444," Therefore I sent for you at once, and you were kind enough to come. So now we are all here in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has commanded you to say to us.”","Tavra Peter uqarraqsiŋaruq, Paŋmapak puttuqsriruŋa God iḷumutun ativlugich iñupayaat aŋalatkai. "
4445," Then Peter started speaking: “I now truly understand that God does not show favoritism in dealing with people, ","Nunauruapayaani kiñaliqaa qiksiksrautiqaqtuaq ilaanik, suli nalaunŋarualiqivluni, God-im akuqtullagaa. "
4446, but in every nation the person who fears him and does what is right is welcomed before him. ,"Nalupqisuŋitchuŋa tusaaŋatilaavsiññik tusaayugaaġiksuanik sivuniqaqtuanik Israel-guruanun, ilaan piksraqtaaġivluta alġaqsruutigitquvlugu tutqiutiqaġumiñaqtilaaŋat God-mun Jesus Christ-guruakun, Atanġuruakun iñupayaanun. "
4447," You know the message he sent to the people of Israel, proclaiming the good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all) – ","Iḷisimarusi taamna tusaayugaaġiksuaq siaminŋaruq iluqaani Judea-mi, isagutivluni Galilee-miñ John Paptaiqsi alġaqsruiganiŋman. "
4448," you know what happened throughout Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John announced: ","Iḷisimammiusi Jesus Nazareth-miukun, God-im suaŋŋasikkaŋagun kuvivḷugu Ilitqusiġiksuani ilaanun. Iḷisimammiusi Jesus kukiḷuŋanivḷugu nakuurualiqivluni, iłuaqsivḷugiḷḷu iluqaisa iłuiḷḷiuqtitaŋi Tuunġaum, God-im itqatigivlugu. "
4449," with respect to Jesus from Nazareth, that God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him. ",Aasii uvagut iḷisimavluta quliaqtuaġigivut iluqaisa Jesus savaaŋi nunaŋanni Jew-guruat Jerusalem-miḷu. Ilaisa tuqunŋagaat kikiaktuutivlugu aŋarrauramun. 
4450," We are witnesses of all the things he did both in Judea and in Jerusalem. They killed him by hanging him on a tree, ","Aasii God-im aŋipkaŋagaa tuqqunmiñ piŋayuaŋni uvluk, aasii tautuktiłługu uvaptiŋnun. "
4451," but God raised him up on the third day and caused him to be seen, ","Iñupayaanun tautuktinŋiñmigaa, aglaan uvagut tautuŋagikput God-im piksraqtaaġiŋaraŋatigut quliaqtuaġitquvlugu. Uvagut niġiqatigiŋagikput imiqatigivlugulu God-im aŋipkaaniŋmagu tuqqunmiñ. "
4452," not by all the people, but by us, the witnesses God had already chosen, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. ","Aasii ilaan piraksriŋagaatigut alġaqsruitquvluta tusaayugaaġiksuanik iñuŋnun, suli uqalugaaġitquvlugu ilaagutilaaŋanik piksraqtaaŋa God-im isivġiquvlugich iñuuruallu tuquŋaruallu. "
4453, He commanded us to preach to the people and to warn them that he is the one appointed by God as judge of the living and the dead. ,"Iluqaġmiŋ uqaqtiŋisa God-im uqautigiŋagaat Jesus, uqaqłutiŋ, Iñupayaagguuq ukpiqtuaq ilaanun piḷuutiŋi suliqutigiŋaiqsauniaqtut itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich Jesus pisigilugu."
4454," About him all the prophets testify, that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.”","Peter taavrumiŋa uqaqtillugu suli, Ilitqusiġiksuaq atqaŋaruq iluqaiññun naalaġniruanun uqaluŋmik. "
4455," While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the message. ","Jew-guruat ukpiqtuat, Peter-m qaiqatiŋi Joppa-miñ, niġiiḷḷaqtauŋarut God-im kuvimmagu aitchuutini Ilitqusiġiksuaq Jew-guŋitchuanununnii. "
4456," The circumcised believers who had accompanied Peter were greatly astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles, ","Qanuq tusaaŋagaich uqaġmata nalukkamiŋnik allakanik uqautchiñik, nanġaqługu God. "
4457," for they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, ","Tavra Peter uqallaŋaruq, Ukua iñuich aŋalatkai Ilitqusiġiksuam uvaptiktuttauq. Kia iñuum paptaiqsaiḷiraġniaqpagich imiġmik? "
4458," “No one can withhold the water for these people to be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did, can he?” ",Tavra Peter piraksriiŋaruq paptaiqsautquvlugich atqagun Jesus Christ. Tavrani apiġiŋagaat uvliuqtuallaquvlugu piqatigilutiŋ.
4459, So he gave orders to have them baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.,
4460, Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles too had accepted the word of God. ,"Tavra tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat, aniqatiillu iluqaani Judea-miittuat, tusaaŋarut Jew-guŋitchuattauq ukpiliġñivḷugich uqaluanik God-im. "
4461," So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers took issue with him, ","Tavra Peter Jerusalem-muŋman, pisaaŋaŋagaat Jew-guruat isumaqaqtuat Jew-guŋitchuat ukpiqtuat nalunaiñŋutchigaksrauvlugich timimikkun, "
4462," saying, “You went to uncircumcised men and shared a meal with them.” ","uqaqłutiŋ, Summan tuyuġmiaġuŋavich Jew-guŋitchuat aimaaġvianni niġiqatigivlugiḷḷu? "
4463," But Peter began and explained it to them point by point, saying, ",Tavra Peter-m quliaqtuaġutiŋagai supayauranik piruanik isuaniñqaŋa.
4464," “I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, an object something like a large sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came to me. ","Iniqpaŋmi Joppa-mi aŋaiyyuuŋaruŋa, aasii qiñiqtuuraaqłuŋa. Atqaqtuamik ukił̣haaqpaktun niŋitauŋaruq qiḷaŋmiñ sisamatigun kaŋiġalluŋisigun, aasii nutqaqłuni saniqqamnun. "
4465," As I stared I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and wild birds. ",Takunnaakkiutikapku tautuŋaruŋa niġrutinik niġrułłuŋniglu paamġuqtuaniglu tiŋmianiglu. 
4466," I also heard a voice saying to me, ‘Get up, Peter; slaughter and eat!’ ","Aasii tusaaŋaruŋa nipimik uqallaktuamik uvamnun, Peter makittin. Tuqutchiḷutin niġġiiñ. "
4467," But I said, ‘Certainly not, Lord, for nothing defiled or ritually unclean has ever entered my mouth!’ ","Tavra kiuŋagiga, Naagga Ataniiq, qanuq suuramikunnii salumaitchuamik niqimik pitqurat niġitquŋisaŋannik uqummirriŋaitchuŋa. "
4468," But the voice replied a second time from heaven, ‘What God has made clean, you must not consider ritually unclean!’ ","Tavra nipi uqallatqiŋaruq qiḷaŋmiñ, Suna God-im salummaanikkaŋa, isummatiginagu salumaitchuagulugu. "
4469," This happened three times, and then everything was pulled up to heaven again. ","Taamna piŋaruq piŋasuiqsuaqłuni, aasii nuqitautqikł̣uni qiḷaŋmun. "
4470," At that very moment, three men sent to me from Caesarea approached the house where we were staying. ","Tavrauvvaa aŋutit piŋasut tikiñŋarut iglumun irvimñun, tilirauruat uvamnun Caesarea-miñ. "
4471," The Spirit told me to accompany them without hesitation. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man’s house. ","Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallautiŋagaaŋa aullaqatigitquvlugich taqiŋaŋaiġḷuŋa. Ukua uvva itchaksrat aniqatiit aullaqasiŋagaanŋa Caesarea-mun, aasii iluqata isiqłuta igluanun Cornelius. "
4472," He informed us how he had seen an angel standing in his house and saying, ‘Send to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, ","Aasii Cornelius quliaqtuaġutiŋagaatigut tautuŋnivḷuni isaġuliŋmik makitaruamik iglumiñi suli uqallautivlugu, Tilisiḷutin Joppa-mun qaitquuŋ Simon taiguutiqaqtuaq Peter-mik. "
4473, who will speak a message to you by which you and your entire household will be saved.’ ,"Ilaan quliaqtuaġutiniaġaatin uqaluŋmik annautigiyumiñakkaġnik, iliviḷḷu igluqatitillu. "
4474," Then as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he did on us at the beginning. ",Uqaqsaġataaqsimmiuŋalu Ilitqusiġiksuam atqaġvigiŋagai uvaptiktupiaġataq isagutisaami. 
4475," And I remembered the word of the Lord, as he used to say, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ ","Aasii itqaŋagitka uqaluŋi Atanġum uqallaŋaruaq, John paptaiġutiqaŋaruq imiġmik, aglaan Ilitqusiġiksuaq iḷirauniaqtuq iḷuvsiññun. "
4476," Therefore if God gave them the same gift as he also gave us after believing in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder God?” ","Tavraasii nalupqinaitchuq God-im aitchuŋammigai Jew-guŋitchuat Ilitqusiġiksuamik aitchuunmisun uvaptiŋnun ukpiqtuaġuqapta Ataniġmun Jesus Christ-mun, Suuvik uvaŋa piñaiḷutaġumiñaġlugu God? "
4477," When they heard this, they ceased their objections and praised God, saying, “So then, God has granted the repentance that leads to life even to the Gentiles.”","Taamna tusaakamirruŋ pisaaŋaŋaiŋagaat, aasii nanġaqługu God uqaqłutiŋ, Tavraptauq Jew-guŋitchuat God-im isumalitqigviksraqaqtinŋagai iñuutquvlugich isuitchuamun."
4478," Now those who had been scattered because of the persecution that took place over Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the message to no one but Jews. ","Tavra ukpiqtuat siamitauŋarut pisigivlugu nagliksaaqtitauniq isagutiruaq Stephen-qaŋa tuqutaumman. Iḷaŋich aullaŋarut ayuuqtigivlutiŋ Phoenicia-mun Cyprus-mullu Antioch-mullu, quliaqtuaġivlugich tusaayugaaġiksuat Jew-nun kisiiññun. "
4479," But there were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene among them who came to Antioch and began to speak to the Greeks too, proclaiming the good news of the Lord Jesus. ","Aglaattauq iḷaŋich ukpiqtuat aŋutit Cyprus-miñ Cyrene-miḷḷu Antioch-muŋarut, aasii quliaqtuaġutivlugich Jew-guŋitchuat, alġaqsruutigivlugich tusaayugaaġiksuat Atanikun Jesus-kun. "
4480," The hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. ","Suli Atanġum suaŋŋataata ikayuŋagai, suli iñugiapiaġataqtuat ukpiliŋarut Ataniġmun."
4481," A report about them came to the attention of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. ","Tusaayugaat taavrumuuna tusaaŋagaich aŋaiyyuliqiruat Jerusalem-mi, aasii tiliŋagaat Barnabas Antioch-mun. "
4482," When he came and saw the grace of God, he rejoiced and encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with devoted hearts, ","Tikiññami iḷitchuġikami God-im quviasaaġniġmagich iñuich, ilaa quyatchaŋaruq, suli qapiŋaisaaŋagai iluqaisa ukpiġnaqtuagutquvlugich iḷumullu illutiŋ Ataniġmun iḷumiŋniñ. "
4483," because he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith, and a significant number of people were brought to the Lord. ","Qanuq Barnabas iñulluatauŋaruq, aŋalatiłłuni Ilitqusiġiksuamun, ukpiqtuagupiaqłuniḷu. Suli iñugiaktuat iñuich ukpiliqsitauŋarut Ataniġmun."
4484," Then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to look for Saul, ",Tavraasii Barnabas aullaŋaruq Tarsus-mun ivaġiaqługu Saul. 
4485," and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught a significant number of people. Now it was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.","Aasii paqitanikamiuŋ, ilaan qaġġisiŋagaa Antioch-mun. Tavra ukiuq naalġataqługu iliŋikta piqatigiŋagaich aŋaiyyuliqiruat, iḷisautivlugiḷḷu iñusalaich. Aasii Antioch-mi ukpiqtuat tairauqqaaŋarut Christ-miunik. "
4486, At that time some prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. ,Tavra tamatkunani uvluni iḷaŋich uqaqtiŋisa God-im ullautiŋarut Jerusalem-miñ Antioch-mun. 
4487," One of them, named Agabus, got up and predicted by the Spirit that a severe famine was about to come over the whole inhabited world. (This took place during the reign of Claudius.) ",Aasii iḷaŋat atiqaqtuaq Agabus-mik makiłłuni aŋalałługu Ilitqusiġiksuam uqaŋaruq piyumaaqtuamik kamanaqtuaq kaaksiunaq piñiaġnivḷugu nunami iluqaani. Taamna nalaunŋaruq Claudius umialgumman Rome-mi. 
4488," So the disciples, each in accordance with his financial ability, decided to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. ",Tavra ukpiqtuat sivunniiŋarut iñupayaaq aitchuiyumiñaqtilaamisun tuyuquvlugu ikayuutiksranik aniqatiinun iñuuruanun Judea-mi. 
4489," They did so, sending their financial aid to the elders by Barnabas and Saul.","Aasii tainna piŋarut, tuyuġivlugich maniich aŋaiyyuliqiruat umialiŋnaŋiññun Barnabas-kullu Saul-kullu."
4490, About that time King Herod laid hands on some from the church to harm them. ,Tavraptauq tainnaiḷivalliġman umialgum Herod nagliksaaqtirraqsiŋagai iḷaŋich aŋaiyyuliqiruat. 
4491," He had James, the brother of John, executed with a sword. ",Ilaan tuqutinŋagaa savikpaŋmik James aniqataa John. 
4492," When he saw that this pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter too. (This took place during the feast of Unleavened Bread.) ","Aasii iḷitchuġikami iviġagniqamigich Jews nagliksaaqtitchivsaaŋaruq, aasii Peter tigutaaqtiłługu. Taamna piŋaruq uvluŋiñi itqautim Qulaurrusiqiviŋmun. "
4493," When he had seized him, he put him in prison, handing him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him. Herod planned to bring him out for public trial after the Passover. ","Tiguanikamirruŋ Peter iḷiŋagaat tigutaaġviŋmun, aasii aitchuutigivlugu qaunagitquvlugu akimiaq atautchimun aŋuyaktinun. Herod sivunniŋaruq isivġiġukługu Peter takkuanni Jew-guruat Qulaurrusiqianikpata. "
4494," So Peter was kept in prison, but those in the church were earnestly praying to God for him. ","Tavra Peter tigutaaġviŋmiinŋaruq, aglaattauq aŋaiyyuliqiruat aŋaiyyutiŋammigaat God-mun qapiŋaił̣ł̣utiŋ."
4495," On that very night before Herod was going to bring him out for trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, while guards in front of the door were keeping watch over the prison. ","Taavrumani unnuami Herod annisiyumaalliġmagu Peter uvluqpan iñuŋnun, Peter siñiŋaruq akunġaŋni malġuk aŋuyaktik, pituqaqłuni malġuiñik kalimñanik, aasii munaqsrich munaqsriŋarut tigutaaġvium paaqpaŋani. "
4496," Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the prison cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him up, saying, “Get up quickly!” And the chains fell off Peter’s wrists. ","Tavraŋŋatchiaq isaġulga Atanġum makinŋaruq tavruŋa, suli qaummaq qaummaġiksiŋaruq tigutaaġviŋmi, aasii isaġulgum saqiñŋagaa Peter tuiqqaŋagun, aasii itiqsaqługu, uqallakłuni, Makittin qilamik. Suli tavrauvvaa kalimñat kataŋarut tayaġniŋiñiñ. "
4497," The angel said to him, “Fasten your belt and put on your sandals.” Peter did so. Then the angel said to him, “Put on your cloak and follow me.” ","Tavra isaġulgum uqallautiŋagaa, Tavsiaġiksaaġiñ aluġusiġḷutillu. Aasii tainna Peter piŋaruq. Isaġulik uqallavsaaŋaruq, Uligaaġiñ, aasii maligluŋa. "
4498," Peter went out and followed him; he did not realize that what was happening through the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. ","Tavra Peter-m maliŋagaa tigutaaġviŋmiñ, aglaan iḷisimaŋaitchuq taamna savaaġikkaŋa isaġulgum iḷumun itilaaŋanik, aglaan isumaŋaruq siññaktuġasugaluni. "
4499," After they had passed the first and second guards, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them by itself, and they went outside and walked down one narrow street, when at once the angel left him. ","Tavra qaaŋianikamisigik sivulliigḷu tugliŋiḷḷu munaqsrich, tikiñŋaruk savił̣hamun upkuaqpaŋmun, anisaġiamun iniqpaŋmun. Taamna upkuaqpak aŋmaŋaruq inmisun, aasii aniŋaruk. Tavraasii pisuaŋaruk apqutitigun, aasii tavraŋŋatchiaq isaġulgum qimaŋagaa Peter. "
4500," When Peter came to himself, he said, “Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting to happen.”","Tavra Peter qaurimmaġiksiŋaruq aasii uqallakłuni, Paŋmapak nalupqisuŋaiqsuŋa Atanġum tiliŋagaa isaġulini, aasii annautivluŋa Herod-gum suaŋŋataaniñ, suli iluqaiññiñ Jew-guruat niġiukkutaanniñ uvapkun."
4501," When Peter realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many people had gathered together and were praying. ","Isumalaallakkaluaqami aullaŋaruq igluanun Mary-m, aakaŋata John Mark. Tavrani iñugiaktuat kasimaŋarut atautchimi aŋaiyyuvlutiŋ. "
4502," When he knocked at the door of the outer gate, a slave girl named Rhoda answered. ","Tavra Peter tigluktuġman siḷataani upkuam, niviaqsiaq atiqaqtuaq Rhoda-mik kiuriyyaŋaruq. "
4503," When she recognized Peter’s voice, she was so overjoyed she did not open the gate, but ran back in and told them that Peter was standing at the gate. ","Iḷisaġikamiuŋ Peter-m nipaa, quviatchakpaił̣ł̣uni upkuiġutigaluaġnagu aqpamik isiŋaruq, aasii uqallautivlugich Peter makitanivḷugu paam siḷataani. "
4504," But they said to her, “You’ve lost your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was Peter, and they kept saying, “It is his angel!” ","Ilaisa uqallautiŋagaat, Kinnaġuqtutin. Aasii ilaa qapiŋaiñŋaruq iḷumun innivḷugu. Ilaisa kiulgitkaat, Isaġulik qaŋma qaunaksriŋa piuq. "
4505," Now Peter continued knocking, and when they opened the door and saw him, they were greatly astonished. ","Tavra Peter tigluktuqtuiññaŋaruq. Kiisaimmaa upkuiġutivaat, aasii tautukkamirruŋ niġiiḷḷaqtauŋarut. "
4506," He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet and then related how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He said, “Tell James and the brothers these things,” and then he left and went to another place.","Tavra urriqavluni argaŋmiñik nipaiquŋagai, aasii quliaqtuaġutiŋagai qanuq Ataniġmun annisisilaamiñik tigutaaġviŋmiñ. Tavra uqallaŋaruq, Quliaqtuaġiyumagiksi taamna James-mun, aniqatiinullu. Tavraniasii ilaa aullaŋaruq allamun inimun."
4507, At daybreak there was great consternation among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. ,Tavra uvluġmagu piallapiaġataŋarut aŋuyaktit qanuqtilaaŋagun Peter-m. 
4508," When Herod had searched for him and did not find him, he questioned the guards and commanded that they be led away to execution. Then Herod went down from Judea to Caesarea and stayed there.","Tavra Herod piraksriiŋaruq ivaqłiatquvlugich Peter-mik, aglaan paqilaiñŋagaat.

4509," Now Herod was having an angry quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they joined together and presented themselves before him. And after convincing Blastus, the king’s personal assistant, to help them, they asked for peace, because their country’s food supply was provided by the king’s country. ","Tavra Herod qinnautipiaġataŋagai iñuich Tyre-miḷu Sidon-miḷu ittuat. Aasii ilaisa ullaŋagaat Herod piqatigiikł̣utiŋ.

4510," On a day determined in advance, Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the judgment seat, and made a speech to them. ","Nalunaiqsauŋaruami uvlumi Herod atiŋagai umialguniġmigun annuġaani, aquvinŋaruq umialgum aquppiutaŋiññun, aasii uqaqłuni ilaiññun. "
4511," But the crowd began to shout, “The voice of a god, and not of a man!” ","Tavra iñuich nipaallaŋarut, Nipaa God-im. Iñugruiññaq uqaŋitchuq. "
4512," Immediately an angel of the Lord struck Herod down because he did not give the glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died. ","Tavraŋŋatchiaq isaġulgata Atanġum tuqupkaŋagaa Herod, qanuq kamanaqsiḷiŋaitkaa God. Tavra ilaa qupilġunikłuni iḷumiñi tuquŋaruq. "
4513, But the word of God kept on increasing and multiplying.,"Aglaan God-im uqalua nauŋaruq, siamiłłuniḷu. "
4514," So Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem when they had completed their mission, bringing along with them John Mark.","Tavra Barnabas-lu Saul-lu naatchikamiŋ piraksraunmiŋnik, utiŋaruk Jerusalem-miñ, piqatigivlugu John Mark."
4515," Now there were these prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch: Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen (a close friend of Herod the tetrarch from childhood) and Saul. ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqiruani Antioch-mi, iḷaŋich uqaqtiŋi God-im inŋarut, iḷisaurriḷḷu, Barnabas-lu Simeon-lu taiguutiqaqtuaq Taaqsipaŋmik, Lucius-lu Cyrene-miu, Manaen-lu iñuguqatiqaŋaruaq Herod-mik kavanauruamik, Saul-lu.

4516," While they were serving the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” ","Aŋaiyyupkaqtillugich Ataniġmun niġiḷaił̣ł̣utiŋ, Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallautiŋagai, Ilaaguaqsisiŋa Barnabas-miglu Saul-miglu savaaksramun ququaqtauviaŋnun uvamniñ. "
4517," Then, after they had fasted and prayed and placed their hands on them, they sent them off.","Tavra niġiḷaitqaaqłutiŋ aŋaiyyuanikamiglu, iḷiŋagaich argatiŋ iliŋiŋnun aasii aullaqtiłługik."
4518," So Barnabas and Saul, sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. ","Tavra Barnabas-lu Saul-lu tilimmatik Ilitqusiġiksuam aullaŋaruk Seleucia-mun, aasii tavraŋŋa tiŋilġaqsiqł̣utiŋ qikiqtamun Cyprus-mun. "
4519," When they arrived in Salamis, they began to proclaim the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. (Now they also had John as their assistant.) ","Tikiññamik Salamis-mun, alġaqsruutigiŋagaat God-im uqalua aŋaiyyuviŋiññi Jew-guruat. Suli John Mark-mik ikayuqtiqaŋaruk. "
4520," When they had crossed over the whole island as far as Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus, ","Ikaaŋagaat iluqaan qikiqtaq Paphos-munaglaan. Tavrani kasuŋagaat aŋatkuqatiqaqtuaq Bar-Jesus-mik, Jew-guvluni uqaqtauniruaq God-mun. "
4521," who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. The proconsul summoned Barnabas and Saul and wanted to hear the word of God. ","Ilaa avilaitqatauŋaruq kavanauruamun qikiqtami Sergius Paulus-mun, puqiksuaguruamun. Kavanauruaq aiyugaaqłiŋaruq Barnabas-mik Saul-miglu tusaasukłuni uqaluanik God-im. "
4522," But the magician Elymas (for that is the way his name is translated) opposed them, trying to turn the proconsul away from the faith. ","Tavra aŋatkum Elymas, Greek-tun taigutaa, akiḷḷiḷiqsuŋagik, ukpiqtaiḷivḷugu kavanauruaq. "
4523," But Saul (also known as Paul), filled with the Holy Spirit, stared straight at him ","Tavra Saul-gum, taggisiqaġmiruaptauq Paul-mik, Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalałługu takunnaakkiutiŋagaa aŋatkuq, "
4524," and said, “You who are full of all deceit and all wrongdoing, you son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness – will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? ","aasii uqallautivlugu, Ilivich iġñiŋa Tuunġaum, uumikłiqsuatiin iluqaanik nakuuruamik, ataramik sagluqivlugich iñuich ilivich pisaasuġmiaġutiŋnik, suli ataramik sagluġuqtinniatakługich Atanġum iḷumun ittuat uqaluŋi. "
4525," Now look, the hand of the Lord is against you, and you will be blind, unable to see the sun for a time!” Immediately mistiness and darkness came over him, and he went around seeking people to lead him by the hand. ","Aasii uvva paŋmapak Atanġum tatavsaġniaġaatin, ayauniaqtutin, suli tautulaisaallagniaġiñ qaummaq. Tavraŋŋatchiaq niptaniġluksisiŋagaa, suli taaqsisiŋagaa, aasii saptalaaqsiŋaruq ivaqłiavluni tasiuqtiksramiñik. "
4526," Then when the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, because he was greatly astounded at the teaching about the Lord.","Tavrani kavanauruaq ukpiliŋaruq, tautukamiuŋ taamna piruaq, qanuq kamanniupiaġataŋaruq iḷisaurrutinik Atanikun."
4527," Then Paul and his companions put out to sea from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia, but John left them and returned to Jerusalem. ","Tavra Paul piqatiniḷu tiŋinnaaŋarut Paphos-miñ, aasii tikił̣ł̣utiŋ Perga-mun Pamphylia-miittuamun. Tavrani John Mark-gum qimaŋagik aasii utiqłuni Jerusalem-mun. "
4528," Moving on from Perga, they arrived at Pisidian Antioch, and on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. ","Tavra igliġiññaŋarut Perga-miñ, aasii tikił̣ł̣utiŋ Antioch-mun Pisidia-miittuamun. Aasii Jew-guruat Savairvianni, aŋaiyyuliaqamiŋ Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuvianni, aquptaaŋaruk. "
4529," After the reading from the law and the prophets, the leaders of the synagogue sent them a message, saying, “Brothers, if you have any message of exhortation for the people, speak it.” ","Taiguaganiŋmata aglaaŋiñiñ Moses, uqaqtiŋisalu God-im, umialiŋnaŋi aŋaiyyuvium uqallaurriŋarut, Aniqatiit, uqaluksraqaġuvsi siḷġiqsuutinik iñuŋnun, uqaġitchi."
4530," So Paul stood up, gestured with his hand and said,","Tavra Paul makinŋaruq, aasii urriqavluni argaŋmiñik uqarraqsiŋaruq, Israel-guqatiimaaŋ, iluqasiḷu Jew-guŋitchuasii, uvani qiksiksrautiqaqtuasii God-mun, naalaġnisiŋa. "
4531,"“Men of Israel, and you Gentiles who fear God, listen: ","God-iŋata ukua iñuich Israel-guruat piksraqtaaġiŋagai maŋŋuuvut, aasii kamanaqsipkaqługich iñuummata tuyuġmiaguvlutiŋ Egypt-mi. God-im annisiŋagai Egypt-miñ kamanaqtuakun suaŋŋanmigun. "
4532," The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made the people great during their stay as foreigners in the country of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. ","Aasii malġukipiani ukiuni iglaummata nunagluktuami, ilaan igḷutuŋagai. "
4533, For a period of about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. ,"Tavra ilaan suksraunġianikamigich tallimat malġuk nunauruat Canaan-mi, ilaan aitchuutigiŋagaa nunaŋat iñuŋmiñun. "
4534," After he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave his people their land as an inheritance. ","Isagutivlugu tavraŋŋa 450-mik ukiivḷutiŋ iñuuniŋanun aglaan Samuel uqaqtaa God-im, God nalunaiqsiraġaŋaruq isivġiqsinik atanniqsimaraġaquvlugich Israel. "
4535, All this took about four hundred fifty years. After this he gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. ,"Tavraasii iliŋich apiqsriŋarut umialiqaġukłutiŋ, aasii God-im aitchuŋagai Saul-mik iġñiŋanik Kish, maŋŋuqaqtuamik Benjamin-miñ, umialigitquvlugu malġukipiani ukiuni. "
4536," Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man from the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. ","God-im piiganikamiuŋ Saul, David umialliutiŋagaa iliŋiññun. Innauvva God-im uqallausiġiŋagaa ilaa, Iḷitchuġigiga David iġñiŋa Jesse-m iviġaumanaqtuaguvlugu uvamnun, piyumiñaqłuni iluqaiññik pitqutimnik ilaanun. "
4537," After removing him, God raised up David their king. He testified about him: ‘I have found David the son of Jesse to be a man after my heart, who will accomplish everything I want him to do.’ ","Iḷaŋat David kiŋuniŋisa, Jesus, God-im unniqsuqłiisigiŋagaa annaurrigitquvlugu Israel-guruanun. "
4538," From the descendants of this man God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, just as he promised. ","Qaiŋaiñŋaan Jesus, John alġaqsruiŋaruq iñupayaanun Israel-nun isumalitqiksuksraunivḷugich, aasii paptaiqsaulutiŋ. "
4539," Before Jesus arrived, John had proclaimed a baptism for repentance to all the people of Israel. ","Aasii John naatchiyasikami savaamiñik, ilaa uqallaŋaruq iñuŋnun, Kiunasugaluŋa isummatigivisiŋa? Taamnauŋitchuŋa niġiugikkaqsi. Aglaan iñuk imma qairuq aqupkun, aluġutik-unnii isigaŋisa nalliummatiŋitchuŋa siŋiiġumiñaġlugik. "
4540," But while John was completing his mission, he said repeatedly, ‘What do you think I am? I am not he. But look, one is coming after me. I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet!’ ","Aniqatiit, kiŋunġuruasii Abraham-mun, iluqasiḷu Jew-guŋitchuat qiksiksraqtuat God-mik, uvaptiŋnun tilirauŋaruq tusaayugaaġiksuaq annautauyumiñaqtuaq. "
4541," Brothers, descendants of Abraham’s family, and those Gentiles among you who fear God, the message of this salvation has been sent to us. ","Taipkua iñuuruat Jerusalem-mi umialiŋnaŋisalu, akuqtuŋił̣ł̣ugu annaurrigitilaaŋanik, kaŋiqsiŋił̣ł̣ugiḷḷu uqaluŋich uqaqtiŋisa God-im, taiguaġuukkaŋich Savaiññipayaaŋiññi, nalautinŋagaich God-im uqaqtiŋisa uqaluŋich suksraunġiqł̣ugu Jesus. "
4542," For the people who live in Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize him, and they fulfilled the sayings of the prophets that are read every Sabbath by condemning him. ","Patchisiksraitkaluaŋŋaġmiŋ sumik-unni ilaanun tuqurrutauyumiñaqtuamik, apiġiŋagaat Pilate tuqutitquvlugu. "
4543," Though they found no basis for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. ","Tavraasii nalautitanikamisigik iluqaisa Bible uqaluŋich ilaagun, atqaŋagaat aŋarrauramiñ, aasii iḷuviqługu iḷuvviviŋmun. "
4544," When they had accomplished everything that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and placed him in a tomb. ",Tavra God-im aŋipkaŋagaa tuqqunmiñ. 
4545," But God raised him from the dead, ",Aasii uvluni iñugiaktuani taamna Jesus tautuktitqataŋaruq tamatkunuŋa qaiqatauŋaruanun inmiñun Galilee-miñ Jerusalem-mun. Aasii tamatkua iñuich tautuktuat ilaanik quliaqtuaŋarut Israel-guruanun. 
4546, and for many days he appeared to those who had accompanied him from Galilee to Jerusalem. These are now his witnesses to the people. ,"Aasii tusaayugaaġiksuanik qaġġirrigivsi tamatkua God-im unniqsuqłiisigiŋakkaŋich maŋŋuuptiŋnun piñiaġnivḷugich, "
4547," And we proclaim to you the good news about the promise to our ancestors, ","pianiŋagai uvaptiŋnun kiŋunġuruanun, aŋipkaqługu Jesus. Aglausimaruq second Psalm-mi inna, “Ilivich Iġñiġigikpiñ. Uvlupak Aapagiliutigiŋma.” "
4548," that this promise God has fulfilled to us, their children, by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second psalm, ‘You are my Son; today I have fathered you.’ ","Qanuq God unniqsuqłiiŋaruq aŋipkaġniaġnivḷugu tuqutqikkumiñaiġḷugu. Una uqaluuruq Bible-ni inna, “Pisiniaġikpiñ aliuġnaqtuamik unniqsuqłiisigiŋaramnik David-mun.” "
4549," But regarding the fact that he has raised Jesus from the dead, never again to be in a state of decay, God has spoken in this way: ‘I will give you the holy and trustworthy promises made to David.’ ","Allamisuli Psalm-mi God-im kaŋiqsiñaqsiḷaavsaaŋagaa uqallakłuni, “God-im aupkaġniaŋitkaa Ilaan Piḷuutaitchuani.” "
4550," Therefore he also says in another psalm, ‘You will not permit your Holy One to experience decay.’ ","Qanuq David tuquŋaruq, savaaġianikamiuŋ piraksriutaa God-im ilaan iñuuqanmiñi, aasii iḷuviqatauvluni maŋŋuumiñun, aasii timaa auvluni. "
4551," For David, after he had served God’s purpose in his own generation, died, was buried with his ancestors, and experienced decay, ","Aglaan taamna iñuk Jesus God-im aŋipkaŋaraa tuqqunmiñ, auŋaitchuq timaa. "
4552, but the one whom God raised up did not experience decay. ,"Aniqatiit, iluqasi iḷisimaruksraupiaqtusi, taavrumuuna Jesus-kun God-im suliqutigiŋaiġumiñaġai piḷuutisi itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich. "
4553," Therefore let it be known to you, brothers, that through this one forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, ","Aasii kiñaliqaa ukpiqtuaq ilaanun annaktitauruq piḷuutipayauramiñ, aasii nalaunŋarualirauvluni. Tainna iñuk iḷiyumiñaitchuq kamagilugich pitqurat aitchuutauŋaruat Moses-kun. "
4554, and by this one everyone who believes is justified from everything from which the law of Moses could not justify you. ,"Qaunagisitchiasiiñ, iḷaanni uqaluŋich uqaqtiŋisa God-im nalautpiaqtut ilivsiññun, uqaqtut inna,"
4555," Watch out, then, that what is spoken about by the prophets does not happen to you:",Savaitqiŋmata iluqakavsaŋmiŋ iniqpaum iñuŋi qaiŋarut naalagiaqłutiŋ uqaluanik God-im. 
4556," ‘Look, you scoffers; be amazed and perish!","Tavrali Jew-guruat tautukamisigik iñusalaich, killuqsraliŋarut, aasii qapiqtaqługich sut uqautigikkaŋi Paul-gum, suli uqamaqłuutivlugu. "
4557,"For I am doing a work in your days,","Tavra Paul-lu Barnabas-lu uqaŋaruk iqsiŋaiqł̣utik, uqaqłutik, God-im uqalua uqautigiraksraupiaqtuq ilivsi sivulliġilusi Jews. Aasii ayyakavsiuŋ, sivunniqsusi ilivsiññik iñuusuŋił̣ł̣usi isuitchuamun. Iḷisimatitchi. Aullaġniaqtuguk Jew-guŋitchuanun. "
4558,"a work you would never believe, even if someone tells you.’”","Qanuq Atanġum piraksriŋagaatigut Bible-ni, uqaqłuni,"
4559," As Paul and Barnabas were going out, the people were urging them to speak about these things on the next Sabbath. ",Tavra uqalua Atanġum siaminŋaruq iluqaiññun nunaaqqiñun tamaaniittuanun. 
4560," When the meeting of the synagogue had broken up, many of the Jews and God-fearing proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who were speaking with them and were persuading them to continue in the grace of God.","Tavrali Jew-guruat maqulluksaiŋarut Jew-guŋitchuanik aġnanik qaukłiuruaniglu aŋutinik iniqpaŋmi ukpiqtuanik God-mun. Ilaisa nagliksaaqtinniarraqsiŋagaich Paul-lu Barnabas-lu, aasii uŋułługik nunaaqqimiŋniñ. "
4561, On the next Sabbath almost the whole city assembled together to hear the word of the Lord. ,"Tavra piiyaŋagaak nunam avyua isigagmiŋniñ kiliktuutausaqługu ilaiññun ayyaiñiŋatigun, aasii aullaqłutiŋ Iconium-mun. "
4562," But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy, and they began to contradict what Paul was saying by reviling him. ",Tavra ukpiqtuat Antioch-mi quviasupiaġataŋarut aŋalatiłłutiglu Ilitqusiġiksuamun.
4563," Both Paul and Barnabas replied courageously, “It was necessary to speak the word of God to you first. Since you reject it and do not consider yourselves worthy of eternal life, we are turning to the Gentiles. ",
4564," For this is what the Lord has commanded us: ‘I have appointed you to be a light for the Gentiles, to bring salvation to the ends of the earth.’” ",
4565," When the Gentiles heard this, they began to rejoice and praise the word of the Lord, and all who had been appointed for eternal life believed. ",
4566, So the word of the Lord was spreading through the entire region. ,
4567," But the Jews incited the God-fearing women of high social standing and the prominent men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their region. ",
4568," So after they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them, they went to Iconium. ",
4569, And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.,
4570, The same thing happened in Iconium when Paul and Barnabas went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a large group of both Jews and Greeks believed. ,"Tainnatun suli piŋammiuq Iconium-mi. Paul-lu Barnabas-lu Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviannun aŋaiyyuliaŋaruk, aasii uqaurrivḷutik iñuŋnik ukpillasivḷugich iñugiapiaġataqtuat Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu. "
4571, But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. ,"Aglaan ukpiŋitchuat Jew-guruat piallaktinŋagaich Jew-guŋitchuat, suli isumanŋutchautiqallasivḷugich aniqatiinun. "
4572," So they stayed there for a considerable time, speaking out courageously for the Lord, who testified to the message of his grace, granting miraculous signs and wonders to be performed through their hands. ","Tavra iliŋik nayuutiŋaruk sivisuruamik. Alġaqsruutigiŋagaak Ataniq iqsisaił̣ł̣utiŋ, ukpiġnaqsiḷiġiruaq uqaluŋmiŋnik annautikun, iḷumun itilaaŋanik suaŋŋasiqługik aliuġnaqtuanik piyumiñaqsivḷugik. "
4573," But the population of the city was divided; some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles. ","Tavra iñuŋi iniqpaum malġuigunŋarut, iḷaŋich iḷaalliutivlutiŋ Jew-guruanun, aasiiḷi iḷaŋich tiliraunikun iḷitchitquranun. "
4574," When both the Gentiles and the Jews (together with their rulers) made an attempt to mistreat them and stone them, ","Tavra qanuqsaġummanmik aŋalatchisaġmata iluqatiŋ Jew-guŋitchuallu Jew-guruallu, piqatigivlugich umialiŋnatiŋ, sivunniŋarut piaqłuqtaġukługich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat uyaġaŋniglu miḷḷuuġlugich. "
4575, Paul and Barnabas learned about it and fled to the Lycaonian cities of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding region. ,"Tilirauruak iḷitchuġiŋagaak taamna, aasii pigruqłutik Lystra-mun Derbe-mullu, iniqpaaŋnun Lycaonia-miittuaŋnun, avataaŋnullu nunaaqqiñun. "
4576, There they continued to proclaim the good news.,Aasii tamatkunani nunaaqqiñi alġaqsruutigivlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq.
4577," In Lystra sat a man who could not use his feet, lame from birth, who had never walked. ","Tavra Lystra-mi iñuqaġniqsuq pisualaitchuamik, pisualaiñŋaniqsuq anikamiqaŋa. "
4578," This man was listening to Paul as he was speaking. When Paul stared intently at him and saw he had faith to be healed, ","Ilaa naalaġniŋaruq Paul-mun uqaqtuamun. Aasiivsauq Paul-gum qiñipiaġataqługu, iḷitchuġivlugu ukpiġutiqaqtilaaŋa iłuaqsirauyumiñaqłuni, "
4579," he said with a loud voice, “Stand upright on your feet.” And the man leaped up and began walking. ","uqallautiŋagaa nipatusivḷuni, Makittin Ilaa maksriŋaruq aasii pisuarraqsivḷuni. "
4580," So when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have come down to us in human form!” ","Tavrali iñusalaich tautukamirruŋ Paul-gum savaaŋa, nipiriŋ aninŋagaat uqaqłutiŋ Lycaonia-ġmiutun, Atqaqigaatigut god-ipta iḷivḷutiŋ iñuktun. "
4581," They began to call Barnabas Zeus and Paul Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. ","Barnabas atchiŋagaat Zeus-mik, aasiiḷi Paul atchiqł̣ugu Hermes-mik pisigivlugu uqałhamaaġniŋa. "
4582," The priest of the temple of Zeus, located just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the city gates; he and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices to them. ","Tavra god Zeus-gum aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋa, aŋaiyyuviat sivuġaani iniqpaum iłłuni, qaġġirriŋaruq immuliviich aŋusalluŋiññik nautchianiglu paaqpaŋiñun, aasii ilaa iñuiḷḷu aitchuisuaqsivḷutiŋ ikipkautinik tiliraunikun iḷitchitquraŋnun. "
4583," But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard about it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting, ","Tavrali Barnabas-lu Paul-lu tusaakamitku taamna aliktuŋagaich annuġaatiŋ, aasii upaktuutivlutiŋ akunġannun iñusalaich nipimikkun, "
4584," “Men, why are you doing these things? We too are men, with human natures just like you! We are proclaiming the good news to you, so that you should turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and everything that is in them. ","Aŋutiit, summan tainna pivisi? Uvaguktauq uvva aŋutik iñugruiññaak irrusiqaqtuak ilivsisuttauq.

4586," yet he did not leave himself without a witness by doing good, by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying you with food and your hearts with joy.” ","Aglaattauq inmiñik iḷisimanaqsisuummiuq nakuuruatigun savaamigun, aitchuqłusi sialuŋmik qiḷaŋmiñ niqiksraniglu nauruanik piviksrakun, niqaiḷḷisaaŋiḷḷusi quviasuquvlusi.

4587," Even by saying these things, they scarcely persuaded the crowds not to offer sacrifice to them.",Tamatkuniŋa uqaluŋnik Barnabas-lu Paul-lu qapiqtipqauraŋagaich iñuich aitchuiñiksraŋanniñ ikipkautinik inmiŋnun.
4588," But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and after winning the crowds over, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, presuming him to be dead. ","Tavra Jew-guruat qaiŋarut Antioch-miñ Pysidia-miittuamiñ Iconia-miḷḷu, aasii maliksuktitchivḷutiŋ iñuŋnik, uyaġaŋnik miḷuqtuŋagaat Paul, aasii kaliksraqługu annisivlugu iniqpaŋmiñ, isumavlutiŋ tuqunivḷugu. "
4589," But after the disciples had surrounded him, he got up and went back into the city. On the next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe.","Tavra iḷitchitqurat iḷḷuaġutimmanni, Paul makinŋaruq, aasii utiqłutiŋ iniqpaŋmun, aasii uvlaakumman ilaalu Barnabas-lu aullaŋaruk Derbe-mun."
4590," After they had proclaimed the good news in that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, to Iconium, and to Antioch. ","Paul-lu Barnabas-lu alġaqsruiŋaruk tusaayugaaġiksuanik Derbe-mi, aasii iñugiaktuat ukpiliŋarut. Tavra utiŋaruk Lystra-mun Iconia-mullu Antioch-mullu Pysidia-miittuamun, "
4591," They strengthened the souls of the disciples and encouraged them to continue in the faith, saying, “We must enter the kingdom of God through many persecutions.” ","iliŋikta suaŋasiḷaaŋagaich ukpiqtuat ukpiġutiŋich, qapiŋaisaaqługich kiikaa ukpiqsimaaquvlugich God-mun, uqautivlugich inna, Uvagut nalautchiruksraupiaqtugut iñugiaktuanik iłuiḷḷiuġutinik isiġumiñaqsisugluta God-im atanniqsimavianun.

4592," When they had appointed elders for them in the various churches, with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the protection of the Lord in whom they had believed. ","Tavra aŋaiyyuliqiruallaani umialiŋnaksrallaaŋagaich, suli aŋaiyyuuqqaaqłutiŋ niġiḷaił̣ł̣utiŋ, qiññuaġutiŋagaich Ataniġmun ukpiġivigiŋakkaŋannun qaunagitquvlugich."
4593," Then they passed through Pisidia and came into Pamphylia, ",Tavra Paul-lu Barnabas-lu iglauvlutik nunaaqqisigun Pysidia-mi tikiñŋaruk Pamphylia-mun. 
4594," and when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia. ","Tavra alġaqsruutigianikamitku tusaayugaaġiksuaq Perga-mi, aullaŋaruk Attalia-mun. "
4595," From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had now completed. ",Aasii tavraŋŋa tiŋinnaaqłutiŋ utiŋarut Antioch-mun aullaġataġviŋmiŋnun. Tavraŋŋa aullaŋaruak ukpiqtuat aŋaiyyutianiŋmatik God-mun qaunagitquvlugik. Tavrani naatchiŋaruk iglaukkaġmiŋnik. 
4596," When they arrived and gathered the church together, they reported all the things God had done with them, and that he had opened a door of faith for the Gentiles. ","Aasii tikiññamik Antioch-mun, katinŋagaich aŋaiyyuliqiruat atautchimun, aasii quliaqtuaġutivlugich iluqaiññik God-im ikayuqługik piramikkun, qanuġlu God-mun ukpiġumiñaqsipkaqtilaaŋannik Jew-guŋitchuat.

4597, So they spent considerable time with the disciples.,Tavra iliŋik nayuutiksraaġiŋaruk piqatigivlugich ukpiqtuat.

"
4599," When Paul and Barnabas had a major argument and debate with them, the church appointed Paul and Barnabas and some others from among them to go up to meet with the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about this point of disagreement. ","Tavra Paul-lu Barnabas-lu siimmaqatigivlugich qapiqtaiḷiqatigiŋagaich taavrumuuna.

4600," So they were sent on their way by the church, and as they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, they were relating at length the conversion of the Gentiles and bringing great joy to all the brothers. ","Tavra tilimmatiŋ aŋaiyyuliqiruaŋisa, iglauŋarut Phoenicia-kun Samaria-kullu, quliaqtuaġutivlugich Jew-guŋitchuat ukpiliqsilaaŋannik God-mun, aasii taavruma tusaakkaŋata quviatchaŋagai iluqaisa aniqatit. "
4601," When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they reported all the things God had done with them. ","Tikiñmata Jerusalem-mun, paġlaŋagaich aŋaiyyuliqiruat tiliraunikullu iḷitchitqurat umialiŋnallu, aasii quliaqtuaŋaruk iluqaiññik God-im ikayuqługik piramiŋnik. "
4602," But some from the religious party of the Pharisees who had believed stood up and said, “It is necessary to circumcise the Gentiles and to order them to observe the law of Moses.”","Aglaattauq iḷaŋich ukpiqtuat iḷauruat Pharisee-ñun makinŋarut, aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Jew-guŋitchuat ukpiliqsuat nalunaiñŋutchiqsitaksraupiaqtut timimikkun, suli kamagitqulugich pitqurat qaisauruat Moses-kun. "
4603, Both the apostles and the elders met together to deliberate about this matter. ,Tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat umialiŋnallu katinŋarut atautchimun isummatigisukługu taamna. 
4604," After there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me to preach to the Gentiles so they would hear the message of the gospel and believe. ","Tavra uqavaaganisugruŋmata, Peter makinŋaruq, aasii uqallautivlugich, Aniqatiit, iḷisimarusi iŋiḷġaan God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagaaŋa akunnavsiññiñ, alġaqsruitquvluŋa tusaayugaaġiksuanik Jew-guŋitchuanun, tusaalutiŋ ukpiliquvlugich. "
4605," And God, who knows the heart, has testified to them by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, ","Aasii God iḷisimaruaq iñuich isumaŋiññik, iḷisimanaqsiŋagaa iviġaumatilaani aitchuutigivlugu Ilitqusiġiksuaq Jew-guŋitchuanun, uvaptiŋnuttauq piḷġusiġmisun. "
4606," and he made no distinction between them and us, cleansing their hearts by faith. ","Suli ilaa allakaaġiiksualiŋaitchuq uvaptiŋniglu iliŋiññiglu, ilaan suliqutigiŋaiqł̣ugich itqaumayumiñaiqł̣ugich piḷuutiŋich ukpiliġmata. "
4607, So now why are you putting God to the test by placing on the neck of the disciples a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we have been able to bear? ,"Paŋmapak aasii summan uuktuġniaqpisiuŋ God, Jew-guŋitchuat kamaksripkaġniaġlugich pitquranik nallivsaunnii maŋŋuuptali uvagullu kamagilluatapialaisaptiŋnik? "
4608," On the contrary, we believe that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way as they are.”","Aglaan ukpiqtugut uvagut annaurrauniaqtilaaptiŋnik nagliktuutiqpaŋagun Atanġum Jesus, tainnatuttauq iliŋich annaurraummiut."
4609, The whole group kept quiet and listened to Barnabas and Paul while they explained all the miraculous signs and wonders God had done among the Gentiles through them. ,"Tavra iluqaġmiŋ kasimaruat nipaiñŋarut, naalaktuaqługik Barnabas-lu Paul-lu quliaqtuaqtillugik qanutchisigun aliuġnaqtuatigun ukpiġnaqsiḷiġutitigun God-im savaaŋigun ilimikkun akunġanni Jew-guŋitchuat. "
4610," After they stopped speaking, James replied, “Brothers, listen to me. ","Tavra uqaaniŋmata, James uqallaŋaruq, Aniqatiit, naalaġnisiŋa. "
4611, Simeon has explained how God first concerned himself to select from among the Gentiles a people for his name. ,"Simon quliaqtuaŋaruq qanuq God-mun ukpiqtitqaaġnivḷugich Jew-guŋitchuat, ilaaguaqsisaqłuni akunġanniñ iñuksramiñik. "
4612," The words of the prophets agree with this, as it is written,","Aasii taamna uqaluŋisa uqaqtiŋisa God-im atiqatigiŋagaat, aglausimarut Bible-ni uqaluŋi inna,"
4613," ‘After this I will return,","Tavra tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat umialiŋnallu iluqaġmiglu aŋaiyyuliqiruat sivunniŋarut piksraġukłutiŋ iñuŋnik iḷamiŋnik, aasii tiliḷugich Antioch-mun piqatigilugik Paul-lu Barnabas-lu.

4616," so that the rest of humanity may seek the Lord,","Aasiuvva kasimaŋarugut atautchimi, aasii iluqata atisivḷuta piksraŋarugut aŋutinik, aasii aullaqtillugich ilivsiññun, piqatigilugik piviuttaġikkavut Barnabas-lu Paul-lu, "
4617,"namely, all the Gentiles I have called to be my own,’ says the Lord, who makes these things  ",iññuk anayanniuqtitchiŋaruak iñuggunmiŋnik savautivlugu Ataniqput Jesus Christ. 
4618, known from long ago.,"Tavraasii tiliŋagivut Judas-lu Silas-lu, inmiŋnik uqautiniaġmigaasi tainnatuttauq tuyuutiptiktun. "
4619," “Therefore I conclude that we should not cause extra difficulty for those among the Gentiles who are turning to God, ","Qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallautiŋagaatigut, uvaguttauq aasii iviġaumagivlugu aitchuġuŋił̣ł̣usi pitquravsaanik siġḷiġnaqtuanik kamaginiaqtuni, ukuniŋałhiñaq piraksriġivsi, "
4620, but that we should write them a letter telling them to abstain from things defiled by idols and from sexual immorality and from what has been strangled and from blood. ,"ilivsi niġiñasi niqinik ilaaguaqtauruanik iñuuraqpaŋnun, auktuġnasiḷu, suli niġiñasi niġrutinik auŋich makinŋaitchuanik, allatuġnasiḷu.

4621," For Moses has had those who proclaim him in every town from ancient times, because he is read aloud in the synagogues every Sabbath.”","Tavra aullaqtitaukamiŋ Antioch-muŋarut, aasii katitanikamisigik ukpiqtuat atautchimun, qaiñŋagaich tuyuutit. "
4622," Then the apostles and elders, with the whole church, decided to send men chosen from among them, Judas called Barsabbas and Silas, leaders among the brothers, to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. ","Aasii taiguaganiŋmatigik, quviasuŋarut qapiŋaisaaġusiamikkun. "
4623, They sent this letter with them:,"Tavra Judas-lu Silas-lu, iliŋiktauq uqaqtauvlutiŋ God-mun, uqautiŋagaich aniqatit sivisuruamik qapiŋaisaaqługich, suaŋasiḷaaqługiḷḷu ukpiġutaatigun. "
4624,"From the apostles and elders, your brothers, to the Gentile brothers and sisters in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, greetings! ","Tavra tavraniisugruaniŋmaŋnik, aullaqtinŋagaich tutqiunmi aniqatit taamapkunuŋa tiliriŋiññun. "
4625," Since we have heard that some have gone out from among us with no orders from us and have confused you, upsetting your minds by what they said, ",Aglaan Silas sivunniŋaruq tavraniitchukłuni. 
4626," we have unanimously decided to choose men to send to you along with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul, ","Tavra Paul-lu Barnabas-lu Antioch-miinŋaruk, iḷisaurrivḷutik piqatigivlugich allat iñugiaktuat alġaqsruutigiŋagaat Atanġum uqalua."
4627, who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Uvliuganikamiŋ, Paul uqallaŋaruq Barnabas-mun, Utaqqiḷavuk takulugich aniqatiit iniqpapayaani alġaqsruivigiŋakkaptiŋni uqaluanik Atanġum, aasii iḷitchuġilugich qanuqtilaaŋannik. "
4628, Therefore we are sending Judas and Silas who will tell you these things themselves in person. ,Tavra Barnabas piqatigisuaqsiŋagaa John Mark maliquvlutik. 
4629, For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place any greater burden on you than these necessary rules: ,"Paul isumaniqsuġli iłuałhaaġasugalugu maliŋitpatik, utiqsaŋamman inmiŋniñ Pamphylia-mi naatkaluaqtinnagu alġaqsruiñiqtiŋ. "
4630," that you abstain from meat that has been sacrificed to idols and from blood and from what has been strangled and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from doing these things, you will do well. Farewell.","Tavra qapiqtaiḷirrapiaŋaruk avanmun isummatillaamiŋnik piqatigiiŋaiqsaallaġmiŋ, Barnabas-li piqasiutiŋagaa Mark, aasii tiŋinnaaqłutiŋ Cyprus-mun. "
4631," So when they were dismissed, they went down to Antioch, and after gathering the entire group together, they delivered the letter. ","Paul-li piksraqtaaġiŋagaa Silas aasii aullaqłutiŋ, aŋaiyyutiqqaaqtillutiŋ aniqatinun, God-mun qaunagitquvlugik. "
4632," When they read it aloud, the people rejoiced at its encouragement. ","Aasii iliŋik iglauŋaruk Syria-kun Cilicia-kullu, aasii Paul suaŋasiḷiŋagai aŋaiyyuliqiruat ukpiġutiŋich."
4633," Both Judas and Silas, who were prophets themselves, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with a long speech. ",
4634," After they had spent some time there, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. ",
4635," But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming (along with many others) the word of the Lord.",
4636," After some days Paul said to Barnabas, “Let’s return and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord to see how they are doing.” ",
4637," Barnabas wanted to bring John called Mark along with them too, ",
4638, but Paul insisted that they should not take along this one who had left them in Pamphylia and had not accompanied them in the work. ,
4639," They had a sharp disagreement, so that they parted company. Barnabas took along Mark and sailed away to Cyprus, ",
4640," but Paul chose Silas and set out, commended to the grace of the Lord by the brothers and sisters. ",
4641," He passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.",
4642," He also came to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple named Timothy was there, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but whose father was a Greek. ","Tavra Paul-kut tikiñŋarut Derbe-mun Lystra-mullu. Ukpiqtuaq tavraniinŋaruq atiqaqtuaq Timothy-mik, iġñiŋa Jew-guruam aġnam ukpiqtuaguruam, aglaan aapaŋa Greek-guvluni. "
4643, The brothers in Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. ,Ilaa uqautigilluataŋagaat iluqatiŋ aniqatit Lystra-mi Aichonia-miittuallu. 
4644," Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek. ",Paul-gum Timothy maliquŋagaa inmigun. Tavra Paul-gum nalunaiñŋutchiŋagaa timaagun Timothy Jew-guqtirrunmik. Taamna piŋagaa pisigivlugich iluqaisa Jew-guruat iñuuruat tamaani iḷisimaruat Timothy-m aapaŋa Jew-guŋisilaaŋanik. 
4645," As they went through the towns, they passed on the decrees that had been decided on by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for the Gentile believers to obey. ","Tavra iglaullaġmiŋ iniqpaktigun, aitchuutigiraġaŋagaich sivunniutit ukpiqtuanun inillakkaŋich tiliraunikun iḷitchitqurat umialiŋnallu Jerusalem-miittuat, uqautivlugich kamagitquvlugich tamatkua piraksriutit. "
4646, So the churches were being strengthened in the faith and were increasing in number every day.,"Tavra aŋaiyyuliqiruat suaŋasiḷaaqtauŋarut ukpiġunmiŋni, suli iñugiaksisaiññaŋarut uvlutuaġman."
4647," They went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the message in the province of Asia. ",Tavra kukiḷuŋarut nunaŋigun Phrygia-m Galatia-vlu. Ilitqusiġiksuam alġaqsruitquŋaitkai tusaayugaaġiksuamik nunaaqqiŋiñi Asia-m. 
4648," When they came to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to do this, ","Tavra akiŋiqamirruŋ nuna Mysia, iglausaġaluaŋarut nunaaqqiŋiñun Bithynia-m, aasii Jesus Ilitqusiġiksuaŋata pipkaŋaitkai. "
4649, so they passed through Mysia and went down to Troas. ,"Tavraasii qaaŋiqł̣ugu Mysia, Troas-muŋarut. "
4650," A vision appeared to Paul during the night: A Macedonian man was standing there urging him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!” ","Tavra Paul qiñiqtuuraaŋaruq unnuami, tautukługu Macedonia-ġmiu makitavluni qaitquuqłiqsuaq inmiñik, uqaqłuni, Qaiḷutin Macedonia-mun ikayuġiaqtigut. "
4651," After Paul saw the vision, we attempted immediately to go over to Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to proclaim the good news to them.","Tavra Paul qiñiqtuuraaganipqaġman, tavrauvvaa itqanaiyaŋarugut aullaġukłuta Macedonia-mun, sivunniqł̣ugu God-mun ququaġnivḷuta alġaqsruitquvluta tusaayugaaġiksuamik iñuŋnun taamani."
4652," We put out to sea from Troas and sailed a straight course to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis, ","Umiaqpagaqłuta aullaŋarugut Troas-miñ, aasii tiŋinnaaqłuta nalimun ikaaqłuta Samothrace-mun, aasii uvlutqiŋman Neapolis-mun. "
4653," and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of that district of Macedonia, a Roman colony. We stayed in this city for some days. ","Aasii tavraŋŋa aullaqłuta nunanmun Philippi-mun, naumaniqsrauruamun iniqpaŋiñi Macedonia-m, Rome-miunik iñuqaqtuaq. Taavrumani iniqpaŋmi uvliuŋarugut. "
4654," On the Sabbath day we went outside the city gate to the side of the river, where we thought there would be a place of prayer, and we sat down and began to speak to the women who had assembled there. ","Tavra Jew-guruat Savaiññiŋanni, siḷataanuŋarugut iniqpaum kuugum siñaanun, isumavluta Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuliaġuunasugalugich tavruŋa. Aasii aquptaaqłuta uqaqatigiŋagivut aġnat katittuat tavruŋa. "
4655," A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple cloth from the city of Thyatira, a God-fearing woman, listened to us. The Lord opened her heart to respond to what Paul was saying. ","Iñuich iḷaŋat tusaarikput aġnaq atiqaŋaruq Lydia-mik, iniqpaŋaniñ Thyatira-m, tuniuqqairi suŋauraammaġiksuanik ukił̣haanik, aŋaiyyurauruaq God-mun. Atanġum puttuqsripkaŋagaa akuqtuġumiñaqsivḷugich uqaluŋi Paul. "
4656," After she and her household were baptized, she urged us, “If you consider me to be a believer in the Lord, come and stay in my house.” And she persuaded us.","Tavra ilaalu igluqatiniḷu paptaiqsauŋarut.

4657," Now as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us who had a spirit that enabled her to foretell the future by supernatural means. She brought her owners a great profit by fortune-telling. ",Iḷaanni aullalgiññapta aŋaiyyuliaġvikaamun paaŋagaatigut kivgam niviaqsiam ilitqusiqł̣uqaġniqsuam nalautchaġuuvluni sunik piyumaaqtuanik. Ilaan pigirini maniññakpautisuunikkaŋi nalautchuġaqłuni. 
4658," She followed behind Paul and us and kept crying out, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.” ","Ilaan maliġuaŋagaa Paul uvagullu nipałłuni, Uvvaukua aŋutit kivgaŋi kamanaġniqsrauruam God-im uqautigaasi qanuġlusi annallasiñiaqtilaavsiññik. "
4659," She continued to do this for many days. But Paul became greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out of her at once. ","Tainna nipanŋaruq uvluni iñugiaktuani. Tavra Paul-gum aġiuvlugu kiŋiaqługu uqallautiŋagaa ilitqusiqł̣uk, Ataniġnaqutaagun Jesus Christ piraksriġikpiñ anitquvlutin ilaaniñ. Tavrauvvaa ilitqusiqł̣uk aniŋaruq ilaaniñ. "
4660," But when her owners saw their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities. ","Tavra pigiriŋisa iḷitchuġikamiŋ maniññagniutigikkaqtiŋ piiġñiġman, tigguġluŋagaich Paul-lu Silas-lu, aasii kaliksraqługik kasimmaviŋmuutiŋagaich sivuġaannun atanaurat. "
4661," When they had brought them before the magistrates, they said, “These men are throwing our city into confusion. They are Jews ","Tavra qaġġisiŋagaich sivuġaannun Rome-miut atanauraŋisa, aasii uqallakłutiŋ, Ukua uvva aŋutit Jew-guruat aŋalayyakkaich iñuich iniqpaptiŋni. "
4662," and are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to accept or practice, since we are Romans.”",Iliŋich iḷisaurrirut paaqsaaŋaruanik pitquraptiŋnun. Uvagut Rome-miuguruaguut kamagiyumiñaitkivut tamatkua piḷġutchich iḷisaurrutiŋich. 
4663," The crowd joined the attack against them, and the magistrates tore the clothes off Paul and Silas and ordered them to be beaten with rods. ","Iñusalaich tapiġiiksinŋarut piyuaqłiqł̣utiŋ iliŋiŋnik, suli atanaurauruat aliktuŋagaich annuġaaŋik Paul-lu Silas-lu, aasii piraksriivḷutiŋ anaumiquvlugik. "
4664," After they had beaten them severely, they threw them into prison and commanded the jailer to guard them securely. ","Tavra anaumianisugruanikamisigik, tigutaaġviŋmuŋagaich piraksriqł̣ugu tigutaaqtanik munaqsri qaunagipiaġataquvlugik. "
4665," Receiving such orders, he threw them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.","Kamagivlugu taamna piraksriusiani, munaqsrim iḷulliġmun tigutaaġviŋmun isiŋagik, aasii payaŋaiyaqługik siŋiġñiŋikkun qiruŋnun tigutaaġutinun."
4666," About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the rest of the prisoners were listening to them. ","Tavra unnuaq qitiqqaqpalliġman Paul-lu Silas-lu aŋaiyyuŋaruk, suli nanġautinik atuqłutik God-mun, aasii tigutaaqtat naalaktuaŋagaich. "
4667," Suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. Immediately all the doors flew open, and the bonds of all the prisoners came loose. ","Tavra tavraŋŋatchiaq nuna aulaqpaŋaruq, maŋŋuŋiunnii tigutaaġvium aulayyaktaallaisa. Tavraŋŋatchiaq iluqaġmiŋ upkuat upkuiŋarut, suli iñupayaam tigutaaqsimmatiŋi kalimñat kataŋarut tigutaaqtaniñ. "
4668," When the jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison standing open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, because he assumed the prisoners had escaped. ","Tavrali tigutaaqtanik munaqsri itiqami, tautukamigich tigutaaġvium upkuaŋi aŋmaruat, isumaliŋaruq iluqaisa tigutaaqtat pigruġasugalugich, tavraasii amuŋagaa savikpani tuqutchaqsaqłuni inmiñik. "
4669," But Paul called out loudly, “Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!” ","Tavra Paul nivliŋaruq nipatutilaamisun, Anniaġnak iliŋnik, qanuq uvaniittugut iluqata. "
4670," Calling for lights, the jailer rushed in and fell down trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas. ","Tavra tigutaaqtanik munaqsri qaummatiksramik qiññuaŋaruq, suli isiniqłakłuni uullaġruaqtun iqsim punŋaruq sivuġaaŋnun Paul-lu Silas-lu. "
4671," Then he brought them outside and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” ","Tavra annisivlugik apiġiŋagik, Aŋutiik, sumik piruksrauvik annaurrausugluŋa? "
4672," They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, you and your household.” ","Iliŋik uqallaŋaruk, Ukpiġiñ Ataniġmun Jesus-mun aasii annaurrauniaqtutin, iliviḷḷu igluqatitillu. "
4673," Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him, along with all those who were in his house. ","Tavra iliŋikta quliaqtuaġiŋagaak uqalua Atanġum ilaanun, iluqaiññullu igluaniittuanun. "
4674, At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds; then he and all his family were baptized right away. ,"Tavra ilaan piŋagik taavrumani unnuam ikarraŋani, aasii iqaġivlugich kiḷḷiaġniŋik, suli ilaa qitunġaniḷu paptaiqsauŋarut tavrauvvaa. "
4675," The jailer brought them into his house and set food before them, and he rejoiced greatly that he had come to believe in God, together with his entire household. ","Tavra ilaan Paul-lu Silas-lu iglumiñuutiŋagik, aasii niqłiqsuqługik. Tavra ilaa igluqatiniḷu quviasupiaġataŋarut pisigivlugu ukpiliġñiqtiŋ God-mun."
4676," At daybreak the magistrates sent their police officers, saying, “Release those men.” ","Tavra uvlaami Rome-miut atanauraŋisa tiliŋagaich piliisimat uqaqłutiŋ, Taamapkuak aŋutik aullaqtitchigik. "
4677," The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent orders to release you. So come out now and go in peace.” ","Tavra tigutaaqtanik munaqsrim uqallautiŋagaa Paul, Atanaurat tilisiŋarut aullaqtitquvlutik, iliviḷḷu Silas-lu tigutaaqtauŋaiġḷutik.

4678," But Paul said to the police officers, “They had us beaten in public without a proper trial – even though we are Roman citizens – and they threw us in prison. And now they want to send us away secretly? Absolutely not! They themselves must come and escort us out!” ","Tavra Paul-gum uqallautiŋagai piliisimat atanauraŋich, Anaumiŋasugaaptiguk iñuich takkuanni, isivġiqsauŋaiḷaak patchisiqaqtilaaġlunuk, iññuk Rome-miunun iḷauruaguuk, suli isiqtaġivlunuk tigutaaġviŋmun.

4679, The police officers reported these words to the magistrates. They were frightened when they heard Paul and Silas were Roman citizens ,"Piliisimat quliaqtuaġiŋagaich taapkua uqaluich atanauranun, aasii tusaakamasigik Paul-lu Silas-lu Rome-miunun iḷautilaaŋaŋnik iqsiḷiŋarut. "

4681," When they came out of the prison, they entered Lydia’s house, and when they saw the brothers, they encouraged them and then departed.","Tavra Paul-lu Silas-lu aniŋaruk tigutaaġviŋmiñ, aasii isiqłutik Lydia-m igluanun.

4682," After they traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. ","Tavra Paul-lu Silas-lu iglauŋaruk nalaułługik Amphipolis-lu Apollonia-lu, aasii tikił̣ł̣utik Thessalonica-mun, aŋaiyyuviqaġniqsuanun Jew-nun. "

4685," Some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with a large group of God-fearing Greeks and quite a few prominent women. ","Tavra iḷaŋich maliksuktitauŋarut, aasii iḷḷativlutiŋ Paul-mullu Silas-mullu, iñugiaktuallu Greek-gich ukpiliŋaruat God-mun, suli iñugiaktuat naumaruat aġnat iḷḷatiŋammiut."
4686," But the Jews became jealous, and gathering together some worthless men from the rabble in the marketplace, they formed a mob and set the city in an uproar. They attacked Jason’s house, trying to find Paul and Silas to bring them out to the assembly. ","Tavra Jew-guruat killuqsraliŋarut, aasii iñuksraqłutiŋ anniqsuutauŋitchuanik iḷatchiqsiñik iñugiaksiŋagaich.

4687," When they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city officials, screaming, “These people who have stirred up trouble throughout the world have come here too, ","Tavra paqinŋiññamisigik, kaliksraŋagaat Jason aniqatillu iḷaŋich sivuġaannun iniqpaum atanauraŋisa, pasivḷugik Paul-lu Silas-lu uqaqłutiŋ, Taipkuak iññuk tuavaalatchiññiktuk iñuŋnik sumiḷḷiqaa, aasiuvva iniqpaptiŋnuŋmiuk. "
4688," and Jason has welcomed them as guests! They are all acting against Caesar’s decrees, saying there is another king named Jesus!” ","Aasii Jason tukkuliŋagik iglumiñun. Iluqaġmiŋ piḷġusiqaqtut paaqłakługich pitquraŋi Caesar-m, Rome-miut umialgata, uqaqłutiŋ umialiqaġnivḷugu allamik, atiqaqtuamik Jesus-mik. "
4689, They caused confusion among the crowd and the city officials who heard these things. ,Tamatkuniŋa uqaqłutiŋ iñusalaiḷḷu atanauraŋiḷḷu iniqpaum tuavaallaktinŋagaich. 
4690," After the city officials had received bail from Jason and the others, they released them.","Tavra atanaurat akiḷiipkaŋagaich Jason-lu allallu maniŋñik annisiqsiłługich, aasii aullaqtinŋagaich."
4691," The brothers sent Paul and Silas off to Berea at once, during the night. When they arrived, they went to the Jewish synagogue. ","Unnupqauraġman, aniqatit tavrauvvaa aullaqtinŋagaich Paul-lu Silas-lu Berea-mun, aasii tikiññamik aŋaiyyuliaŋaruk Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviannun. "
4692," These Jews were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, for they eagerly received the message, examining the scriptures carefully every day to see if these things were so. ","Iñuich tavrani uqautisuġnapayaaŋarut iñuŋniñ Thessalonica-miittuaniñ, qanuq ilaisa naalaġniŋagaat uqaluk kipiġniuqłutiŋ. Aasii uvlutuaġman iḷisaŋagaich Bible uqaluŋich iḷitchuġiniaqłutiŋ Paul-gum uqaluŋi iḷumun itilaapiaŋannik. "
4693," Therefore many of them believed, along with quite a few prominent Greek women and men. ","Iñugiaktuat tavrani ukpiliŋarut, suli iñugiaktuat Greek-guruat aġnat naumaruat, allallu iñugiaktuat Greek-guruat aŋutit, ukpiliŋammiut. "
4694," But when the Jews from Thessalonica heard that Paul had also proclaimed the word of God in Berea, they came there too, inciting and disturbing the crowds. ","Tavra Jew-guruat Thessalonica-mi tusaakamiŋ Paul alġaqsruiñivḷugu uqaluanik God-im Berea-mi tavruŋaŋarut, aasii tuavaalatchiññikłutiŋ iñuŋnik tavrani. "
4695," Then the brothers sent Paul away to the coast at once, but Silas and Timothy remained in Berea. ","Tavra aniqatit tavrauvvaa aullaqtinŋagaat Paul iglauyaaksraŋanun taġiukun, aglaan Silas-lu Timothy-lu qimaktinŋaruk Berea-mun. "
4696," Those who accompanied Paul escorted him as far as Athens, and after receiving an order for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they left.","Taapkua aullaqtitchiruat Paul-mik qaniŋagaat Athens-munaglaan, aasii utiqłutiŋ Berea-mun. Paul-miñ piraksriusiaqaŋaruk Silas-lu Timothy-lu qaiñasuaquvlugik inmiñun."
4697," While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was greatly upset because he saw the city was full of idols. ","Tavra Paul utaqqiḷḷaagnik Silas-lu Timothy-lu Athens-mi, tautukłuni iñugiaktuanik iñuuraqpaŋnik isumaalutchaŋaruq atqunaqłuni. "
4698," So he was addressing the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles in the synagogue, and in the marketplace every day those who happened to be there. ","Tavra ilaan uqaaqatigiŋagai Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuvianni, Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu ukpiliŋaruat God-mun, suli uvlutuaġman kasimmaviŋñi uqaqatigivlugich iñuich nalaurrutiruat. "
4699," Also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him, and some were asking, “What does this foolish babbler want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods.” (They said this because he was proclaiming the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.) ","Iñuitchauq iḷaŋich Epicurean-guruat Stoic-guruallu iḷisaurrit qapiqtaŋagaat Paul. Aasii iḷaŋich uqallaŋarut, Sumik una uqavalari uqaġniḷuksaava?

4700," So they took Paul and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, “May we know what this new teaching is that you are proclaiming? ","Tavra ilaisa Paul tiguŋagaat aasii qaġġisivlugu sivuġaannun kasimaruat Areopagus-mi uqaqłutiŋ, Iḷisimasukkaluaqtugut taavrumuuna nutauruakun iḷisaurrutigikkapkun. "
4701," For you are bringing some surprising things to our ears, so we want to know what they mean.” ","Qanuq uvva tusaakkapta iḷaŋich allayuaġigivut, aasii iḷitchuġisukkaluaqtugut sumik tamatkua sivuniqaqtilaaŋannik. "
4702, (All the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there used to spend their time in nothing else than telling or listening to something new.),"Tavra iluqaġmiŋ Athens-miut, imaŋŋaqtallu iñuuruat tavrani, atuġaġniġaat piviksraqtiŋ suuŋiḷanun, quliaqtuaqsiññaqłutiŋ naagga tusaaniaqłutiŋ sunik nutauruanik."
4703," So Paul stood before the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in all respects. ","Tavra Paul, makiłłuni sivuġaannun kasimaruat Areopagus-mi uqallaŋaruq, Iñuich Athen-miut, puttuqsriruŋa ilivsi qanusipayaakun piraġausikun ukpiqtauniqsusi. "
4704," For as I went around and observed closely your objects of worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: ‘To an unknown god.’ Therefore what you worship without knowing it, this I proclaim to you. ","Qanuq pisuaqtuallaġma qiñiqtuaqługich init iñuuraqpaŋnun aŋaiyyuvigikkasi, paqinŋammiuŋa ikipkaiviŋmik ukuniŋa aglaqaqtuamik, Nalukkaptiŋnun god-mun. Taamnaasii aŋaiyyuvigikkaqsi nalullaan quliaqtuaġiniaġiga paŋmapak ilivsiññun. "
4705," The God who made the world and everything in it, who is Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by human hands, ","God savaŋaruaq nunamik suli supayaanik imaġikkaŋiñik, Atanġuruq qiḷaŋmullu nunamullu, iñuuviqapiaġniaqtuksrauŋitchuq ininik iñuich savaaŋiññik. "
4706," nor is he served by human hands, as if he needed anything, because he himself gives life and breath and everything to everyone. ","Naaggaunnii ilaa piqaqtuksraupiaġniaŋitchuq iñuich piḷiuġumiñakkaŋiññik ilaa savautilugu, qanuq ilaan inmiñik aitchuutigigai iñuggullu aniġniġlu supayaallu iñupayaanun. "
4707," From one man he made every nation of the human race to inhabit the entire earth, determining their set times and the fixed limits of the places where they would live, ","Suli ilaan savaŋagai atautchimiñ iñuŋmiñ, iñupayaurat nunami iñuutquvlugich iluqaani nunami. Ilaan sivunniutiŋagai sivuani iñuullaaniksraŋich suli killiksraŋich iñuuniaġviḷḷaaŋisa. "
4708," so that they would search for God and perhaps grope around for him and find him, though he is not far from each one of us. ","Tainna God piŋaruq iñuŋnun ivaquyumagaluaqłuni, iḷaanni paqinnasugaluni ivaqtuiññaqpanni, God qanitkaluaqtuq iluqaptiŋnun. "
4709," For in him we live and move about and exist, as even some of your own poets have said, ‘For we too are his offspring.’ ","Qanuq ilaa kaŋiutauruq iñuusipayauraptiŋnun. Iḷaŋitchauq taigualirivsi uqallaŋammiut,"
4710," So since we are God’s offspring, we should not think the deity is like gold or silver or stone, an image made by human skill and imagination. ","Tavra tusaakamirruŋ Paul uqaġman aŋŋisikun tuqqunmiñ, iḷaŋisa kipagiŋagaat. Aglaalli allat uqallakłutiŋ, Naalaktuavsaaġukkiptigiñ taavrumiŋa iḷaannigu. "
4711," Therefore, although God has overlooked such times of ignorance, he now commands all people everywhere to repent, ",Tavra Paul aniŋaruq kasimaruaniñ. 
4712," because he has set a day on which he is going to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom he designated, having provided proof to everyone by raising him from the dead.”","Aasiivsauq iñuich iḷaŋich iḷḷatiŋarut ilaanun ukpiliqł̣utiŋ, iḷagiŋagaat Dionysius iḷauruaq Ariopagus-nun, aġnaġlu atiqaqtuaq Damaris-mik, allallu iñuich."
4713," Now when they heard about the resurrection from the dead, some began to scoff, but others said, “We will hear you again about this.” ",
4714, So Paul left the Areopagus. ,
4715," But some people joined him and believed. Among them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.",
4716, After this Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth. ,Taavruma aquagun Paul aullaŋaruq Athens-miñ aasii Corinth-mukłuni. 
4717," There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome. Paul approached them, ","Tavra ilaan kasuŋagaa Jew-guruaq atiqaqtuaq Aquila-mik, aniŋaruaq Pontus-mi, qaiqqammiqsuaq Italy-miñ piqatigivlugu nuliani Priscilla, qanuq umialik Claudius pitqurriiŋaruq Jew-payaurat aullaquvlugich Rome-miñ. Tavra Paul-gum tautugiaŋagik. "
4718," and because he worked at the same trade, he stayed with them and worked with them (for they were tentmakers by trade). ","Aasii atiruamik savaaqaġniqamiŋ tuppiuqtauvlutiŋ, ilaan nayuŋagik. "
4719," He addressed both Jews and Greeks in the synagogue every Sabbath, attempting to persuade them.","Tavra Paul uqaaġaqtuq Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuvianni Savaiññipayaani, ukpiliqsinniaqługich Jew-guruallu Greek-giḷḷu."
4720," Now when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul became wholly absorbed with proclaiming the word, testifying to the Jews that Jesus was the Christ. ","Tavra Silas-lu Timothy-lu tikiñŋaruk Macedonia-miñ, Paul aptatiqaŋaruq alġaqsruiñiġmik, uqaluktuaġivlugu Jew-guruanun Jesus Christ-gunivḷugu. "
4721," When they opposed him and reviled him, he protested by shaking out his clothes and said to them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am guiltless! From now on I will go to the Gentiles!” ","Tavraasii akiḷḷiḷiqsuġmanni uqamaqłuutivluniḷu, ilaan ivsuktuŋagai annuġaani aasii uqallautivlugich, Annaurrauŋitkuvsi ilivsiññik pasiruksraurusi. Uvaŋa patchisauŋitchuŋa. Paŋmapaŋmiñ alġaqsruiñiaqtuŋa Jew-guŋitchuanun. "
4722," Then Paul left the synagogue and went to the house of a person named Titius Justus, a Gentile who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue. ","Tavra Paul qimaŋagai aasii aullaqłuni igluanun Jew-guŋitchuam atiqaqtuam Titus Justus-mik, aŋaiyyusuuruaq God-mun. Ilaan iglua siḷalliuŋaruq Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviannun. "
4723," Crispus, the president of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his entire household, and many of the Corinthians who heard about it believed and were baptized. ","Crispus umialiŋnauruaq aŋaiyyuviŋmi ukpiliŋaruq Ataniġmun, piqatigivlugich igluqatipayaani. Suli iñugiaktuat allat iñuich Corinth-miittuat tusaavlugu uqaluk, ukpiliŋarut suli paptaiqsauvlutiŋ."
4724," The Lord said to Paul by a vision in the night, “Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent, ","Unnuat iḷaŋanni, Paul qiñiqtuuraaŋaruq. Tavrani Atanġum uqallautiŋagaa, Iqsiñak, aglaan alġaqsruivsaaġiñ, nikatchaŋnak, "
4725," because I am with you, and no one will assault you to harm you, because I have many people in this city.” ","qanuq itqatigigikpiñ, iñuum kialiqaa anniaqsaayumiñaitkaatin, qanuq ittut iñugiaktuat iñutka uumani iniqpaŋmi. "
4726," So he stayed there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","Tavra Paul tavraniinŋaruq ukiuq iḷavlugu avvaġmik, iḷisautivlugich iñuich God-im uqaluanik."
4727," Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews attacked Paul together and brought him before the judgment seat, ","Tavra Gallio kavanaupkaqtillugu Greece-mi, Jew-guruat katinŋarut, aasii tigguġlukługu Paul qaġġisiŋagaat uqaqsitaaġviŋmun, "
4728," saying, “This man is persuading people to worship God in a way contrary to the law!” ","uqaqłutiŋ, Iñuk una maliksuktitchiñiaqsaaruq iñuŋnik aŋaiyyutquvlugich God-mun, paaqłaglugich pitqurat. "
4729," But just as Paul was about to speak, Gallio said to the Jews, “If it were a matter of some crime or serious piece of villainy, I would have been justified in accepting the complaint of you Jews, ","Tavra Paul uqallaksaaqsimmiuġlu, Gallio-m uqallautiŋagai Jew-guruat, Iñuk taamna piŋakpan sumik pigiitchuamik pitqurallu kamagiŋiḷḷugich, uvaŋa manimmiyumiñaġaluaġivsi Jew-guruasii. "
4730," but since it concerns points of disagreement about words and names and your own law, settle it yourselves. I will not be a judge of these things!” ","Aglaan pasiñiqavsiuŋ uqaluktigullu iñuiḷḷu atiŋisigun ilivsiḷu pitquravsigun, ilivsiññik iłuaqsruġumiñaġiksi. Tamatkunuuna isivġiqsauniaŋitchuŋa. "
4731, Then he had them forced away from the judgment seat. ,Tavra ilaan aninŋagai uqaqsitaaġviŋmiñ. 
4732," So they all seized Sosthenes, the president of the synagogue, and began to beat him in front of the judgment seat. Yet none of these things were of any concern to Gallio.","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ tigguġluŋagaat Sosthenes, umialiŋnaŋa Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviata, aasii anaumiaqsivḷugu sivuġaani uqaqsitaaġvium. Taamna suliqutigiŋiñmigaa Gallio-m suuramikunnii."
4733," Paul, after staying many more days in Corinth, said farewell to the brothers and sailed away to Syria accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea because he had made a vow. ","Taavruma aquagun Paul iñugiaktuanik uvliuqqaaqłuni Corinth-mi, qimaŋagai aniqatit tiŋilġaivḷuni Cyria-mun, piqatigivlugik Priscilla-lu Aquila-lu. Cenchreae-miinŋaġmi, niaquni mitquiŋagaa piḷġusiatitun Jew-guruat unniqsuqłiivḷuni God-mun. "
4734," When they reached Ephesus, Paul left Priscilla and Aquila behind there, but he himself went into the synagogue and addressed the Jews. ","Tavra tikiñŋarut Ephesus-mun, aasii Paul-gum qimaŋagik Priscilla-lu Aquila-lu tavruŋa. Ilaa aŋaiyyuliaŋaruq Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviannun, aasii tavrani uqavaaqatigiŋagai Jew-guruat. "
4735," When they asked him to stay longer, he would not consent, ","Iliŋisa apiġimmanni nayuqtuallaquvlutiŋ sivisuuraqtuami, ilaa pisuŋiñŋaruq. "
4736," but said farewell to them and added, “I will come back to you again if God wills.” Then he set sail from Ephesus, ","Aglaan qimaksaqamigich uqallautiŋagai, Pisuutigikpagu God-im, utaqqiñiaġmigivsi. Tavra tiŋinnaaqsaŋaruq Ephesus-miñ."
4737," and when he arrived at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church at Jerusalem and then went down to Antioch. ","Tavra tikiññami Caesarea-mun, aullaŋaruq Jerusalem-mun, aasii paġlaŋagai aŋaiyyuliqiruat, aasii aullalgił̣ł̣uni Antioch-mun. "
4738," After he spent some time there, Paul left and went through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.","Tavraniittuallaqqaaqłuni aullaŋaruq aasii kukiḷukłuni nunaaqqiñun Galatia-mi Phrygia-miḷu, suaŋasiḷiqługich ukpiġutiŋich ukpiqtuat."
4739," Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, arrived in Ephesus. He was an eloquent speaker, well-versed in the scriptures. ","Tavra Jew-guruaq atiqaqtuaq Apollos-mik, iñuguŋaruaq Alexandria-mi, tikiñŋaruq Ephesus-mun. Ilaa uqaqtuayuruaq iḷisimmaġikł̣uni Bible uqaluŋiññik. "
4740," He had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and with great enthusiasm he spoke and taught accurately the facts about Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John. ","Iḷisausiaqaŋaniqsuq Atanikun, aasii qapiŋaił̣ł̣uni uqaŋaruq iḷisaurrivḷuniḷu nalaupiaqługich sut sivuniqaqtuat Jesus-mik. Aglaan iḷisimatualuŋniqsuq paptaiġutaanik John. "
4741," He began to speak out fearlessly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained the way of God to him more accurately. ","Ilaa uqarraqsiŋaruq taluqsrautaił̣ł̣uni Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuvianni. Tavra Priscilla-vlu Aquila-vlu naalaktuaqqaaqługu aggisiŋagaak, aasii iḷisautimmaġiksaagaqsivḷugu God-im annaurriḷḷatilaaŋanik iñuŋnik. "
4742," When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he assisted greatly those who had believed by grace, ","Tavra Apollos sivunniġman aullaġukłuni Greece-mun aniqatit Ephesus-mi ikayuŋagaat, tuyuqłutiŋ aniqatimiŋnun Greece-miittuanun paġlatquvlugu tikitpan. Tikiññami, Apollos ikayuŋagai tamatkua ukpiliŋaruat God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun. "
4743," for he refuted the Jews vigorously in public debate, demonstrating from the scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.","Qanuq ilaan qapiġnaił̣ł̣uni, suaŋavlutiŋ uqaluŋi, Jew-guruat qapiqtaŋagai kasimaruani qapiqtautikamiŋ nalupqinaiyaqługu Bible uqaluŋiññiñ Jesus Christ-guniŋa."
4744," While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul went through the inland regions and came to Ephesus. He found some disciples there ","Tavra Apollos Corinth-miitillugu, Paul iglauŋaruq nunatigun aasii tikił̣ł̣uni Ephesus-mun. Tavrani kasuŋagai iḷaŋich ukpiqtuat. "
4745," and said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” They replied, “No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.” ","Aasii ilaan apiġiŋagai, Aitchuusiaġiŋavisiuŋ Ilitqusiġiksuaq ukpiliqavsi? Aasii kiuŋagaat, Naagga, qaŋaunnii tusaaŋaitchugut Ilitqusiġiksuaqaqtilaamik. "
4746," So Paul said, “Into what then were you baptized?” “Into John’s baptism,” they replied. ","Tavra Paul apiġivsaaŋagai, Qanuqłusi paptaiqsauŋavisi? Iliŋisa kiuŋagaat, Paptaiqsauŋarugut John piraksriutaagun. "
4747," Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.” ","Tavra Paul uqallaŋaruq, John paptaiŋagai iñuich isumalitqiŋmata, uqautivlugich iñuich Israel-guruat ukpiliquvlugich iñuŋmun qaiyumaaqtuamun aqumigun, taavrumuŋa Jesus-mun. "
4748," When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus, ","Taamna tusaakamirruŋ, paptaiqsauŋarut atqagun Atanġum Jesus. "
4749," and when Paul placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy. ","Taavruma aquagun, Paul iḷimmagich argaŋni ilaiññun, Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalarraqsiŋagai, aasii iliŋich uqaŋarut allakanik uqautchiñik nalukkamiŋnik, suli uqaqłutiŋ kaŋiqsiñaqsivḷugich God-im uqaluksriutiŋi. "
4750, (Now there were about twelve men in all.),Iñugiaktilaaġivalliŋagaat qulit malġuk aŋutit.
4751," So Paul entered the synagogue and spoke out fearlessly for three months, addressing and convincing them about the kingdom of God. ","Tavra Paul aŋaiyyuliaqtaŋaruq Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuviannun, aasii piŋasuni tatqiñi uqaqłuni taluqsraŋił̣ł̣uni, uqaaqatigivlugich ukpiqtinniaqługich God-im atanniqsimmataagun iñuŋnun. "
4752," But when some were stubborn and refused to believe, reviling the Way before the congregation, he left them and took the disciples with him, addressing them every day in the lecture hall of Tyrannus. ","Aglaan iḷaŋich uqayunaiñŋarut ukpiġuŋiñŋarullu, suli uqautigimaqłukługulu Ataniq takkuanni iñuich kasimaruat. Tavra Paul qimaŋagai, aasii piqasiutivlugich ukpiqtuat, aasii uvlutuaġman uqautivlugich igluqpaŋmi iḷisaurriviani Tyrannus-gum. "
4753," This went on for two years, so that all who lived in the province of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.","Paul tainna piŋaruq ukiuŋni malġuŋni, iñupayaurat iñuuruat nunaaqqiŋiññi Asia-m Jew-gugaluaqtuat Jew-guŋitkaluaqtuallu tusaaŋarut uqaluŋiñik Atanġum."
4754," God was performing extraordinary miracles by Paul’s hands, ",Tavra God-im savaktinŋagaa Paul naumaruanik aliuġnaqtuanik. 
4755," so that when even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his body were brought to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them. ","Kakkiiyautikkaluat unnii saaġuallu atuŋakkaŋi Paul naŋittuanuutiraġaŋagaich, aasii naŋirrutiŋich piiġaqtut, ilitqusiqł̣uiḷḷu anivḷutiŋ iliŋiññiñ. "
4756," But some itinerant Jewish exorcists tried to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who were possessed by evil spirits, saying, “I sternly warn you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.” ","Tavra kukiḷuktuat iḷaŋich Jew-guruat ilitqusiqł̣uiyairuat atuqsaaŋagaat atqa Atanġum Jesus tamatkunuŋa ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuanun.

4757," (Now seven sons of a man named Sceva, a Jewish high priest, were doing this.) ",Tainna piŋaniqsut tallimat malġuk iġñiŋi Jew-guruam aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata atiqaqtuam Sceva. 
4758," But the evil spirit replied to them, “I know about Jesus and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?” ","Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uum kiuŋagai, Jesus iḷisimagiga, Paul iḷisimammigiga, aglaan ilivsi kitkuuvisi? "
4759, Then the man who was possessed by the evil spirit jumped on them and beat them all into submission. He prevailed against them so that they fled from that house naked and wounded. ,"Tavra iñuum ilitqusiqł̣uqaqtuam piyuarraqsiŋagai piaqługivlugich, aasii payarivḷugich. Tavra iluqaġmiŋ pigruŋarut iglumiñ annuġaiḷat kiḷḷiaqtat. "
4760," This became known to all who lived in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks; fear came over them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was praised. ","Tavra taamna tusaaŋagaat iluqaġmiŋ Jew-guruat Jew-guŋitchuallu iñuuruat Ephesus-mi aasii iqsitchaŋarut iluqaġmiŋ, aasiiḷi atqa Atanġum Jesus kamanaqtuaġiŋagaat iñuich. "
4761," Many of those who had believed came forward, confessing and making their deeds known. ","Iñugiaktuat ukpiqtuaġuqtuat qaiŋarut, aasii quliaqługich takkuanni iñuich sut savaaġisuuratiŋ, "
4762," Large numbers of those who had practiced magic collected their books and burned them up in the presence of everyone. When the value of the books was added up, it was found to total fifty thousand silver coins. ","iḷaŋisa savaaqaġuuŋaruat aŋatkiqiniġmik qaġġisiŋagaich makpiġaatiŋ atautchimun, aasii ikipkaqługich takkuanni iñupayaat.

4763, In this way the word of the Lord continued to grow in power and to prevail.,Tavra iñuvsaat ukpiġiliŋagaat uqalua Atanġum. Suli iluqaġmiŋ iñuich iḷitchuġiŋagaat suaŋŋatiqaqtilaaŋanik God-im uqalua.
4764," Now after all these things had taken place, Paul resolved to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and Achaia. He said, “After I have been there, I must also see Rome.” ","Tavra tamatkua piruat aquatigun, Paul aŋalałługu Ilitqusiġiksuam sivunniqsinŋagaa iglausukłuni nunaaqqiŋisigun Macedonia-m Greece-guvlu, aasii Jerusalem-mugluni. Ilaa uqallaŋaruq, Jerusalem-muqqaaġluŋa, tautugaksraġipiaġmigiga Rome. "
4765," So after sending two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, he himself stayed on for a while in the province of Asia.","Tavra tiliŋagik Timothy-lu Erastus-lu ikayuqtiŋni Macedonia-mun, ilaali ittuallavsaaġukłuni nunaaqqiŋiñi Asia-m."
4766, At that time a great disturbance took place concerning the Way. ,"Tasamma tainnaiḷimman iñuich tuavaallapiaġataŋarut Ephesus-mi, akiḷḷiḷiqsuqługu alġaqsruun Atanikun. "
4767," For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought a great deal of business to the craftsmen. ","Qanuq iñuk atilik Demetrius-mik, maniŋñik qatiqtuanik savviqiri aŋaiyyuviŋŋualiuġuuruaq tuvraqługu aŋaiyyuvikpak savaaguruaq aġnamun god-iŋŋuamun Artemis-mik atiqaqtuamun. Savaaŋata maniññaktiqpagaġniġai savaktit. "
4768," He gathered these together, along with the workmen in similar trades, and said, “Men, you know that our prosperity comes from this business. ","Tavra ilaan katitinŋagai atautchimun iluqaisa savaaqaqtuat ilimiktuttauq, aasii uqallautiŋagai, Aŋutiit, iḷisimarusi taavruma savaapta maniññaktilluataġuugaatigut. "
4769," And you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and turned away a large crowd, not only in Ephesus but in practically all of the province of Asia, by saying that gods made by hands are not gods at all. ","Aasii qiñiqtusi tusaarusiḷu taamna Paul suliqitilaaŋanik. Ilaa uqaqtuq god-iŋŋuat iñuich savaaŋich god-tauŋiññivḷugich, aasii maliksuktiłługich iñuich iñugiaktuat uvani Ephesus-mi, iluqakavsaŋiññiḷu nunaaqqiŋisa Asia-m. "
4770," There is danger not only that this business of ours will come into disrepute, but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be regarded as nothing, and she whom all the province of Asia and the world worship will suffer the loss of her greatness.”","Aasiuvva anayanaqtuq savaaqput, una kisimi suksraaqtauniaŋitchuq, aglaallu aŋaiyyuvikpaŋa kamanaqtuam aġnam god-iŋŋuam Artemis-gum suuŋaiġñiaġmiuq, aasii kamanautaa suksraunġiqsauluni iñupayaat aŋaiyyuvigisuukkaŋat Asia-mi iluqaaniḷu nunami."
4771," When they heard this they became enraged and began to shout, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” ","Taamna iñusalaich tusaakamirruŋ qinnaliqpaŋarut, suli nipaalarraqsiŋarut, Kamanaqtuq Artemis god-iŋat Ephesus-miut. "
4772," The city was filled with the uproar, and the crowd rushed to the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, the Macedonians who were Paul’s traveling companions. ","Tavra iñuŋi iniqpaum tuavaallapiaġataŋarut. Suli pialaruat tigguġluŋagaich Gaius-lu Aristarchus-lu Macedonia-ġmiuk, Paul iglauqatiŋik, aasii aullautivlugik kasimaviŋmun. "
4773," But when Paul wanted to enter the public assembly, the disciples would not let him. ","Paul ullautiyumaŋagaluaqtuq kasimaruanun, ukpiqtuat pitchaiḷiŋagaat. "
4774," Even some of the provincial authorities who were his friends sent a message to him, urging him not to venture into the theater. ",Iḷaŋisaptauq atanaurauruat ilaan avilaitqatiŋi tilisiŋammiut uqaluŋmik ilaanun ullautisaatquŋił̣ł̣ugu iñuich kasimmaviannun. 
4775," So then some were shouting one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had met together. ","Tavrali kasimaruat iluqaġmiŋ tuavaallaŋarut. Iḷaŋich nipaalaŋarut inmikkun, iḷaŋiḷḷi allamik, qanuq kasimaruat alapinŋarut, suli iñugiagniqsrat naluŋarut summan katitilaamiŋnik. "
4776," Some of the crowd concluded it was about Alexander because the Jews had pushed him to the front. Alexander, gesturing with his hand, was wanting to make a defense before the public assembly. ","Tavra iñuk atiqaqtuaq Alexander-mik Jew-guruat saavititaŋat sivuġaannun kasimaruat urriqaŋaruq argaŋmiñik nipaiquvlugich, aasii uqaġnirraqsivḷuni iñuŋnun iliŋich patchisauŋiññivḷutiŋ. "
4777," But when they recognized that he was a Jew, they all shouted in unison, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” for about two hours. ","Tavra iḷisaġikamirruŋ Jew-gutilaaŋa, atausiŋŋuqługu nipiriŋ nipaalaŋarut malġuŋni ikarraaŋni, Kamanaqtuq Artemis god-iŋat Ephesus-miut."
4778," After the city secretary quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, what person is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image that fell from heaven? ","Kiisaimmaa iniqpaŋmi aglaktim nipaiqsinnamigich iñusalaich uqallaŋaruq, Iñuŋi Ephesus, iñupayaat iḷisimarut iniqpaŋat Ephesus-miut qaunaksriruagutilaaŋanik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋanik kamanaqtuam Artemis, taavrumalu iñuuraqpaum kataŋaruam siḷamiñ. "
4779," So because these facts are indisputable, you must keep quiet and not do anything reckless. ","Iḷisimalusiasii tamatkua kialiqaa piiḷaaġiyumiñaiñmagich nipaalaruksrauŋitkaluaqtusi, suli piaqłuktaŋaiġḷusi. "
4780, For you have brought these men here who are neither temple robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. ,"Qaġġisiŋagisi ukuak iññuk uvuŋa tigligaiŋaitkaluaqtillugik aŋaiyyuvikpavsiññik, naagga uqamaqłuktautiqaŋaitkaluaqtillugik god-iptigun. "
4781," If then Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him have a complaint against someone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls; let them bring charges against one another there. ","Tavra Demetrius-lu savaktiniḷu pasikkutiksraqaġumiŋ iññukkun, uqaqsitaaġviich aŋmarut uqaqsitaaġvikaallu uvlut, isivġiqsillu ittut, tavrani uqautikkutiyumiñaqtut avanmun. "
4782," But if you want anything in addition, it will have to be settled in a legal assembly. ","Suli allanik iłuaqsrugaksranik piqavsaaġuvsi, iłuaqsruqtauyumiñaqtut pitquratigun kasimakpata. "
4783," For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause we can give to explain this disorderly gathering.” ","Qanuq anayasaaqtugut uqautikkusiaksramik tuavaalanikun uvlupak, patchisiksraiñŋapta nalauttualiḷuta uumuuna tuavaalanikun. "
4784," After he had said this, he dismissed the assembly.","Tavraasii taamna uqallausiġianikamiuŋ, aġiupkaŋagai kasimaruat."
4785," After the disturbance had ended, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them and saying farewell, he left to go to Macedonia. ","Tuavaalaŋaiġmata, Paul katitquŋagai ukpiqtuat aasii qapiŋaisaaqqaaqługich, qimaŋagai Macedonia-muksaqłuni. "
4786," After he had gone through those regions and spoken many words of encouragement to the believers there, he came to Greece, ","Iglauganikami tamatkunuuna nunaaqqisigun, qapiŋaisaaqługich ukpiqtuat, tikiñŋaruq Greece-mun. "
4787," where he stayed for three months. Because the Jews had made a plot against him as he was intending to sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. ","Tavraniinŋaruq tatqiñi piŋasuni, aasii iḷitchuġikami Jew-guruat sivunniuġniġmata inmigun piyumigivluni, itqanaiyaŋaruq aullaġukłuni Syria-mun. Tavra sivunniŋaruq utiqsaġukłuni Macedonia-kun. "
4788," Paul was accompanied by Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, and Timothy, as well as Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. ","Sopater iġñiŋa Pyrrhus Berea-mium aullaqasiŋagaa, aasiiḷi Thessalonica-ġmiuniñ Aristarchus-guvlu Secundus-lu Gaius-lu Derbe-mium, Timothy-vlu Tychicus-lu Trophimus-lu nunaaqqiŋiñiñ Asia-m tuvaaqasiŋagaat. "
4789, These had gone on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas. ,"Taapkua iñuich ayuŋarut sivuptiŋni, aasii utaqqivḷuta Troas-mi. "
4790," We sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and within five days we came to the others in Troas, where we stayed for seven days. ","Uvagulli tiŋinnaaŋarugut Philippi-miñ Niqinaqianiŋmata Puvlaksiŋaitchuamik Punniġmik, aasii tallimat uvlut pianiŋmata kasuŋagivut Troas-mi. Tavrani tallimat malġuŋni uvliŋarugut."
4791," On the first day of the week, when we met to break bread, Paul began to speak to the people, and because he intended to leave the next day, he extended his message until midnight. ",Tavra Savaitchuani katinŋarugut atautchimun nullautchiġviḷiqiniaqłuta. Paul uqautiŋagai iñuich unnuaq qitiqqaġataqtillugu aullaġniaqłuni uvlaakukpan. 
4792, (Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.) ,Qulliich iñugiaŋarut qiḷaguami kasimavivsiŋñi. 
4793," A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in the window, was sinking into a deep sleep while Paul continued to speak for a long time. Fast asleep, he fell down from the third story and was picked up dead. ","Aasii nukatpiaq atiqaqtuaq Eutychus aquppiŋaruq igalaurami. Paul uqaŋaiḷḷaiqsillugu Eutychus uiñġaliqsaiññaŋaruq, kiisaimmaa siquvuq, aasii katakłuni piŋayuaŋniñ qiḷaguak nunamun. Tigummarruŋ tuquŋaniqsuq. "
4794," But Paul went down, threw himself on the young man, put his arms around him, and said, “Do not be distressed, for he is still alive!” ","Tavra Paul atqaŋaruq aasii pułłuni qulaŋiqł̣ugu, iqinnamiuŋ uqallaŋaruq Uŋiariñasi. Iñuuruq suli. "
4795," Then Paul went back upstairs, and after he had broken bread and eaten, he talked with them a long time, until dawn. Then he left. ","Tavra Paul mayuanikami, niġianikamirruŋ nullautchiġvik, uqautivsaaŋagai uvluġataqtillugu, aasii aullaqłuni. "
4796, They took the boy home alive and were greatly comforted.,"Aasii iñuich aggisiŋagaat nutaġaaluk iñuuvlugu, suli quviasaaqtauqpaŋarut."
4797," We went on ahead to the ship and put out to sea for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for he had arranged it this way. He himself was intending to go there by land. ","Aasii ayuvluta umiaqpaŋmun tiŋilġaqsiqsaŋarugut Assos-mun, sivuniqaqłuta ikisukługu Paul tavrani. Tainna sivunniuŋamman ilaa nunakuaġumavluni. "
4798," When he met us in Assos, we took him aboard and went to Mitylene. ","Tavra kasuġmatigut Assos-mi, ikuŋagikput umiaqpaŋmun aasii Mitylene-mukłuta. "
4799," We set sail from there, and on the following day we arrived off Chios. The next day we approached Samos, and the day after that we arrived at Miletus. ","Tavraŋŋa tiŋinnaaŋarugut uvlaakumman akiŋiqł̣ugu Chios. Aasii uvlutqiŋman tikił̣ł̣uta Samos-mun, aasii uvlaakutqiŋman tikił̣ł̣uta Miletus-mun. "
4800," For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus so as not to spend time in the province of Asia, for he was hurrying to arrive in Jerusalem, if possible, by the day of Pentecost. ","Tavra Paul sivunniŋaruq qaaŋiqsaaġukługu Ephesus, iñaviqqutchiġuŋił̣ł̣uni nunaaqqiŋisiguaġumi Asia-m. Ilaa tikiññasuaġuŋaruq Jerusalem-mun piñaġumiñaqpan Pentecost-liqikpata itchukłuni."
4801," From Miletus he sent a message to Ephesus, telling the elders of the church to come to him.",Paul aullaqtitchiŋaruq uqaluŋmik Miletus-miinŋaġmi Ephesus-mun apiġivlugich umialiŋnaŋich aŋaiyyuliqiruat paaquvluni. 
4802," When they arrived, he said to them, “You yourselves know how I lived the whole time I was with you, from the first day I set foot in the province of Asia, ","Aasii tikiñmanni uqallautiŋagai, Iḷisimarusi qanuq iñuuŋatilaamnik akunnavsiññi sivulliġmiñqaŋa uvlumiñ tikiññama nunaaqqiŋiñun Asia-m. "
4803," serving the Lord with all humility and with tears, and with the trials that happened to me because of the plots of the Jews. ",Savautiŋagiga Ataniq kamasaaŋaiqł̣uŋa qulviuqłuŋalu siġḷiġniuġutit pisigivlugich tikitqataqtuat uvamnun sivunniuġutiŋich piyumigivluŋa Jew-guruat. 
4804," You know that I did not hold back from proclaiming to you anything that would be helpful, and from teaching you publicly and from house to house, ","Iḷisimarusi aŋŋikkutiŋaitkivsi supayaamik ikayuutauyumiñaqtuamik ilivsiññun alġaqsruikama iḷisautivlusiḷu kasimakavsi, igluvsiññiḷu. "
4805, testifying to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus. ,"Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu ativlugich kiliktuŋagitka isumalitqiquvlugich piḷuunmiŋniñ God-mun, suli ukpiquvlugich Ataniptiŋnun Jesus-mun. "
4806," And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am going to Jerusalem without knowing what will happen to me there, ","Aasii paŋmapak Ilitqusiġiksuam piyummiqł̣uŋa aullaaqsiruŋa Jerusalem-mun, nalugaluaŋŋaan suna piruksraq uvamnun taamani. "
4807, except that the Holy Spirit warns me in town after town that imprisonment and persecutions are waiting for me. ,Aglaan iḷisimatualuktuŋa Ilitqusiġiksuam iḷitchuġipkaŋagaaŋa iniqpapayaani tigutaaqtauniaġnivḷuŋa nagliksaaqtitauniaġnivḷuŋalu. 
4808," But I do not consider my life worth anything to myself, so that I may finish my task and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the good news of God’s grace.","Aasii tamatkua sivuuġagiŋitkitka. Sugiŋitkigalu tuqutkaluaqpanŋa.

4809, “And now I know that none of you among whom I went around proclaiming the kingdom will see me again. ,Aasii kukiḷuŋaruŋa akunnavsiññi alġaqsruutigivlugu God-im atanniqsimmataa iñuŋnun. Paŋmapak uvva iḷisimaruŋa iluqasi taututqigñiaŋitkivsiŋa. 
4810, Therefore I declare to you today that I am innocent of the blood of you all. ,Tavraasii uqallautipiaġivsi uvlupak patchisauyumiñaiññiḷuŋa nalliqsi annaurrauyumiñaiññiqpan. 
4811, For I did not hold back from announcing to you the whole purpose of God. ,Qanuq aŋŋikkutiŋaitkivsi sumik uqautigiraksramnik iluqaanik God-im iḷisimatqukkaŋanik ilivsiññun. 
4812," Watch out for yourselves and for all the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God that he obtained with the blood of his own Son. ","Qaunagisitchi ilivsiññun iluqaisalu ukpiqtuat, Ilitqusiġiksuam qaunagitquŋakkaŋi ilivsiññun. Qaunagisigik aŋaiyyuliqiruat God-mun, ilaan pigiliutiŋakkaŋi tuqqutaagun ilaan iġñiġmi. "
4813," I know that after I am gone fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock. ","Iḷisimaruŋa aullaanikkuma, iḷisaurriruat iḷumun inŋitchuanik iqsiñaqtuatun amaqqutun akunnaaġutiniaqtut ilivsiññun, aasii ukpiġutaiqsinniaġniaġaich ukpiqtuat. "
4814," Even from among your own group men will arise, teaching perversions of the truth to draw the disciples away after them. ",Suli ilivsi nanmiñiq akunnavsiññiñ satqummiġñiaqtut iñuich uqaurriruat saglunik ukpiqtuaguruanun maliksuktitchiñiaqłutiŋ inmiŋnun. 
4815," Therefore be alert, remembering that night and day for three years I did not stop warning each one of you with tears. ","Taamna pisigilugu nipuŋaitchitchi, itqaumalusi ukiuni piŋasuni nutqaŋaitchuŋa unnuakkaluami naagga uvlumi kiliktuqługu iñupayaaq tamatkunuuna qulviuġaluaŋŋaġma."
4816, And now I entrust you to God and to the message of his grace. This message is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified. ,"Aasii paŋmapak aŋaiyyutigivsi God-mun qaunagitquvlusi, suli aŋaiyyutivlusi nagliktuutikun uqaluŋiñun suaŋasiḷaaquvlugu ukpiġutiksi iḷaŋiutiyumiñaqsiḷusi quviasaaġusianik ilaan aitchuutigisuukkaŋiñik ilaaguaqtamiñun. "
4817, I have desired no one’s silver or gold or clothing. ,"Kaviuġiŋaitkiga kialiqaa mania qatiqtuaq naagga kaviqsuaq, naagga annuġaaŋi. "
4818, You yourselves know that these hands of mine provided for my needs and the needs of those who were with me. ,Ilivsi iḷisimarusi ukuniŋa argamnik savautiqaġuuruŋa piqallasivḷuta iḷatkalu pigiraksraġikkaptiŋnik. 
4819," By all these things, I have shown you that by working in this way we must help the weak, and remember the words of the Lord Jesus that he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”","Tamatkunani iluqaiññi iḷisautiŋagivsi tainna iñuk savagluni ikayuiruksrautilaaŋanik piḷguitchuanik, itqaumalugich uqaluŋi Atanġum Jesus uqallaŋamman, Quvianałhaaqtuq aitchuiruni aitchuusiaqaġniġmiñ."
4820," When he had said these things, he knelt down with them all and prayed. ","Tavra Paul tamatkuniŋa uqaanikami, sitquqatigiŋagai iluqaisa umialiŋnat, aasii aŋaiyyuvlutiŋ. "
4821," They all began to weep loudly, and hugged Paul and kissed him, ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ qiaqpaŋarut, suli iqimmaaqługu Paul kunikł̣ugulu kutpaiŋagaat, "
4822," especially saddened by what he had said, that they were not going to see him again. Then they accompanied him to the ship.",isumaaġutigiłhaaqługich uqaluich uqallausiġiŋakkaŋi taututqigñiaŋiññivḷuni. Tavra umiaqpaŋmuqatigiŋagaat.
4823," After we tore ourselves away from them, we put out to sea, and sailing a straight course, we came to Cos, on the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. ","Tavra avinnapta iliŋiññiñ tiŋilġaqsiqł̣uta sivunmun ikaaŋarugut Cos-mun, aasii uvlutqiŋman tikił̣ł̣uta Rhodes-mun, aasii taavaŋŋa aullalgiññapta tikił̣ł̣uta Patara-mun. "

4825," After we sighted Cyprus and left it behind on our port side, we sailed on to Syria and put in at Tyre, because the ship was to unload its cargo there. ","Qiñiġnaqsikaptigu qikiqtaq Cyprus, uŋalaŋata tuŋaagun igliŋarugut Syria-mun. Tulaŋarugut Tyre-mi, umiaqpak niuriñiaqłuni usiamiñik. "
4826," After we located the disciples, we stayed there seven days. They repeatedly told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem. ","Aasii paqiłługich iḷaŋich ukpiqtuat tavraniittuat, nayuŋagivut tallimat malġuŋni uvluni. Ilitqusiġiksuam uqallaguliqsinŋagai ukpiqtuat Paul Jerusalem-muquŋił̣ł̣ugu. "
4827," When our time was over, we left and went on our way. All of them, with their wives and children, accompanied us outside of the city. After kneeling down on the beach and praying, ","Tavra uvliuġniksravut tavrani naanmata, aullaŋarugut iglausaqłuta.

4828," we said farewell to one another. Then we went aboard the ship, and they returned to their own homes. ","Tavrali uvagut ikiŋarugut umiaqpaŋmun, aasiiḷi iliŋich aisaqłutiŋ. "
4829," We continued the voyage from Tyre and arrived at Ptolemais, and when we had greeted the brothers, we stayed with them for one day. ","Aullaqapta tiŋinnaaqłuta Tyre-miñ, tikiñŋarugut Ptolemais-mun. Tavrani paġlaŋagivut aniqatit nayuqługich uvlivḷuta atautchimik. "
4830," On the next day we left and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. ","Uvlaakumman aullaŋarugut aasii tikił̣ł̣uta Caesarea-mun. Tavrani isiŋarugut igluanun Philip isumalitqiksitchiñiaqtim, aasii tukkuġivlugu.

4831, (He had four unmarried daughters who prophesied.),"Aasii Philip sisamanik paniqaġniqsuaq uiñiŋaitchuanik, uqaqtauruanik God-mun. "
4832," While we remained there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. ",Uvliuqtilluta uqaqtauruaq God-mun atiqaqtuaq Agabus-mik tikiñŋaruq Judea-miñ. 
4833," He came to us, took Paul’s belt, tied his own hands and feet with it, and said, “The Holy Spirit says this: ‘This is the way the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man whose belt this is, and will hand him over to the Gentiles.’” ","Ullakamisigut ilaan tiguŋagaa Paul tavsia aasii qiḷiqsruqługich ilaan isigaŋni argaŋniḷu, uqaqłuni, Inna uqaqtuq Ilitqusiġiksuaq, Tainnatun Jew-guruat Jerusalem-mi qiḷiqsruiñiaġaat iñuk tavsiqaqtuaq mattumiŋa aasii aitchuutigilugu Jew-guŋitchuanun.

4834," When we heard this, both we and the local people begged him not to go up to Jerusalem. ","Taamna tusaakaptigu, uvagullu iñuiḷḷu araŋagaluaġikput Paul Jerusalem-muquŋił̣ł̣ugu. "
4835," Then Paul replied, “What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be tied up, but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.” ","Paul kiuŋagaatigut, Suvisiuvva qiavisi isumaalluksaaqpisiŋa?

4836," Because he could not be persuaded, we said no more except, “The Lord’s will be done.”","Tavra payariyumiñaiññiqaptigu Paul, aġiuŋarugut aasii uqallakłuta, Pisuutaa Atanġum nalaulli. "
4837, After these days we got ready and started up to Jerusalem. ,Taapkua uvlut aquatigun itqanaiyarraqsiŋarugut aasii Jerusalem-muksaqłuta. 
4838," Some of the disciples from Caesarea came along with us too, and brought us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, a disciple from the earliest times, with whom we were to stay. ","Tavra iḷaŋisa ukpiqtuat qaiŋaruat Caesarea-miñ maliŋagaatigut, aasii aggisivluta tukkuksraptiŋnun igluanun Mnason Cyprus-mium, ukpiqtuaġuŋaruaq sivulliqsigun ukpiqtuatigun."
4839," When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly. ","Tikiññapta Jerusalem-mun, aniqatit paġlapiaġataŋagaatigut. "
4840," The next day Paul went in with us to see James, and all the elders were there. ","Uvlaakumman Paul piqasiŋagaatigut tautugiaqługu James, aasii umialiŋnat iluqaġmiŋ tavraniinŋarut. "
4841," When Paul had greeted them, he began to explain in detail what God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. ",Paul paġlaqqaaqługich quliaqtuaġutiŋagai iluqapayauraŋiññik savaamigun God-im piŋaraŋiñik akunġanni Jew-guŋitchuat. 
4842," When they heard this, they praised God. Then they said to him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all ardent observers of the law.

4846," take them and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may have their heads shaved. Then everyone will know there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself live in conformity with the law.

4848," Then Paul took the men the next day, and after he had purified himself along with them, he went to the temple and gave notice of the completion of the days of purification, when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them.

4858," for a crowd of people followed them, screaming, “Away with him!” ","Qanuq piaqłuktaliqsuat iñuich maliqataqługu saqłaŋarut, Tuqutauli."
4859," As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the commanding officer, “May I say something to you?” The officer replied, “Do you know Greek?

4862," When the commanding officer had given him permission, Paul stood on the steps and gestured to the people with his hand. When they had become silent, he addressed them in Aramaic,","Aŋuyaktit atanauraŋata uqallakkumiñaqsiŋagaa. Tavra Paul makinŋaruq tunmiqqanun, aasii urriqavluni argaŋmiñik iñuŋnun.

4864," (When they heard that he was addressing them in Aramaic, they became even quieter.) Then Paul said, ","Tavra tusaakamirruŋ uqallautimmatiŋ Hebrew-tun uqaqłuni, nipaimmaġiksaaŋarut. Aasii Paul uqallaŋaruq. "
4865," “I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated with strictness under Gamaliel according to the law of our ancestors, and was zealous for God just as all of you are today.

4866," I persecuted this Way even to the point of death, tying up both men and women and putting them in prison, ","Sivuani nagliksaaqtitchuuŋagitka iñuich tuqunniallavlugich ukpiqtuat Jesus-mun, tigutaaqługich aŋutillu aġnallu tigutaaġviŋmun. "
4867," as both the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was on my way to make arrests there and bring the prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished. ","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat iluqaġmiglu uqaqsitaaqtitchirit arguanaiġumiñaġaat iḷumun uqaqtilaaġa. Iliŋiññiñ aitchuusiaqaŋaruŋa tuyuutinik aniqatinun Jew-guruanun Damascus-miittuanun.

4872," So I asked, ‘What should I do, Lord?’ The Lord said to me, ‘Get up and go to Damascus; there you will be told about everything that you have been designated to do.’ ","Tavra apiġiŋagiga, Suniaqpik uvaŋa Ataniiq?

4873," Since I could not see because of the brilliance of that light, I came to Damascus led by the hand of those who were with me. ","Tavra tautuksiḷḷaiġñiqama qaummaġikpaił̣ł̣uni taimña qaumaniq, tasirriutiŋagaanŋa iglauqatiŋma aullativluŋa Damascus-mun."

4875," came to me and stood beside me and said to me, ‘Brother Saul, regain your sight!’ And at that very moment I looked up and saw him. ","Ullautiŋaruq uvamnun, aasii makiłłuni saniqqamnun uqallautiŋagaaŋa, Aniqaan Saul, tautullasiiñ. Tavra tavrauvvaa tautullasiŋaruŋa aasii qiviaqługu. "
4876," Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has already chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear a command from his mouth, ","Tavra ilaan uqallautiŋagaaŋa, God-iŋata maŋŋuupta piksraqtaaġiŋagaatin iḷitchuġitquvlutin pisuunmiñik, tautuquvlugu piḷuutaitchuaq Kivgani, suli tusaatquvlugu ilaan nipaa.

4879," When I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance ","Utianikama Jerusalem-mun aŋaiyyuniallaġma aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, qiñiqtuuraaŋaruŋa, "
4880," and saw the Lord saying to me, ‘Hurry and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.’ ","aasii tautukługu Ataniq uqallaktuaq uvamnun, Qilamiqsruġlutin aullaġasuaġiñ Jerusalem-miñ, qanuq iñuich uvani ukpiġiniaŋitkaat quliaqtuan uvapkun. "

4884," The crowd was listening to him until he said this. Then they raised their voices and shouted, “Away with this man from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live!” ","Taavrumuŋaaglaan uqallautaanun, iñusalaich Paul naalaġniŋagaat. Tavraasii niparraqsiŋarut nipatutilaamiktun, uqaqłutiŋ, Tuqulliuna innasiq iñuk.

4885," While they were screaming and throwing off their cloaks and tossing dust in the air, ","Tavra nipaalapkaqługich annuġaamiŋniglu takuyaġaqtillugich miḷḷuutigivlugulu nunam avyua siḷamun, "
4886, the commanding officer ordered Paul to be brought back into the barracks. He told them to interrogate Paul by beating him with a lash so that he could find out the reason the crowd was shouting at Paul in this way. ,"Rome-miut aŋuyaktiŋisa atanauraŋata piraksriŋagai iñuŋni itqutitquvlugu Paul aŋuyaktit igluŋiññun, suli uqallautivlugich ipiġaqtuġlugu iḷitchuġisaquvlugich sumik Jew-guruat saqłautiqaqtilaaŋannik ilaagun. "
4887," When they had stretched him out for the lash, Paul said to the centurion standing nearby, “Is it legal for you to lash a man who is a Roman citizen without a proper trial?” ","Tavra qiḷiqsruiganiŋmanni akłunaanik ipiġaqtuġukługu, Paul-gum uqallautiŋagaa aŋuyaktit atanauraŋat makitaruaq tavrani, Pitqurani nalaunŋava ipiġaqtuġuvsiuŋ iñuk Rome-miunun iḷauruaq, isivġiqsauŋaiñŋaan? "
4888," When the centurion heard this, he went to the commanding officer and reported it, saying, “What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen.” ","Aŋuyaktit atanauraŋata taamna tusaakamiuŋ, ullautiŋaruq qaukłiannun aŋuyaktit aasii uqallautivlugu, Susaġumaagaqsivich? Taamna iñuk Rome-miunun iḷauruq. "
4889," So the commanding officer came and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?” He replied, “Yes.” ","Qaukłiata ullakługu Paul apiġiŋagaa, Uqallautiŋŋa, Rome-miunun iḷauvich? Paul kiuŋagaa, Aaŋ. "
4890," The commanding officer answered, “I acquired this citizenship with a large sum of money.” “But I was even born a citizen,” Paul replied. ","Aŋuyaktit qaukłiat uqallaŋaruq, Tauqsiŋagiga taamna iḷaliutinik manisalaŋnik. Paul uqallaŋaruq, Aglaan uvaŋa aniŋaruŋa nutim iḷauvluŋa. "
4891," Then those who were about to interrogate him stayed away from him, and the commanding officer was frightened when he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had had him tied up.","Tavra tamatkua apiqsruqtuiyumaruat Paul-mik niguutiŋarut ilaaniñ tavrauvvaa, taamnalu aŋuyaktit qaukłiat iqsitchaŋammiuq iḷitchuġivluni Paul Rome-miunun iḷautilaaŋanik ilaallu qiḷiqsruiñiqamiuŋ."
4892," The next day, because the commanding officer wanted to know the true reason Paul was being accused by the Jews, he released him and ordered the chief priests and the whole council to assemble. He then brought Paul down and had him stand before them.","Tavra uvlaakumman aŋuyaktit qaukłiat kipiġniuqłuni iḷisimasukługu nalupqinaiġḷugu sumik Jew-guruanun pasisilaaŋanik Paul.

4894, At that the high priest Ananias ordered those standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth. ,Tavra aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiata Ananias-gum piraksriŋagai tamatkua makitaruat saniġaani patiquvlugu Paul qanġagun. 
4895," Then Paul said to him, “God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Do you sit there judging me according to the law, and in violation of the law you order me to be struck?” ","Tavra Paul-gum uqallautiŋagaa, Isivġiqsauŋŋuaqtuatiin, God-im nalupqinaitchuq tatavsaġniaġaatin.

4897," Paul replied, “I did not realize, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, ‘You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”","Tavra Paul kiuŋagai, Aniqatiit, naluruŋa aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun qaukłiġitilaaŋanik. Qanuq aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna, “Uqautiginiaŋitkiñ pigiiḷiḷugu atanauraŋat iñukpich.”"
4898," Then when Paul noticed that part of them were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, he shouted out in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead!” ","Tavra Paul iḷitchuġikami kasimaruat alġaiŋich Sadducee-guniġmata, aasii alġaiŋich Pharisee-guvlutiŋ, uqallaŋaruq nipatusivḷuni uqaqsitaaqtitchiriñun, Aniqatiit, uvaŋa Pharisee-guruŋa, iġñiŋa Pharisee-m.

4901," There was a great commotion, and some experts in the law from the party of the Pharisees stood up and protested strongly, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?” ","Tavra kasimaruat nipatusisaiññaŋarut, aasii iḷaŋich iḷisaurrit pitquranik iḷauruat Pharisee-ñun makinŋarut, aasii qapiqtaiḷiqpakłutiŋ uqaqłutiŋ, Iḷitchuġiŋitchugut suuramik-unnii piḷuktuamik uumani iñuŋmi.

4902," When the argument became so great the commanding officer feared that they would tear Paul to pieces, he ordered the detachment to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.","Tavra uqavaaqtuat suammaŋmata, qaukłiat aŋuyaktit anayatchaŋaruq Paul siquvrataġinasugalugu iliŋiññun.

4904," When morning came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they had killed Paul. ",Uvlaaġmagu Jew-guruat kasimavlutiŋ sivunniuŋarut unniqsuqłiipiaġataqłutiŋ niġiyumiñaiññivḷutiŋ imiġuraġumiñaiññivḷutiglu tuqutqaaŋaunnagu Paul. 
4905, There were more than forty of them who formed this conspiracy. ,Sippaqaŋaruq malġukipiaq iñuich sivunniuqatigiiksuat taavrumiŋa.

","Tavra nukatpiam uqallautiŋagaa, Jew-guruat sivunniŋarut apiġisukłutin qaġġisitqulugu Paul uqaqsitaaqtitchiriñun uvlaakun, apiqsruqtuġumaŋŋuaġlugu pasiummaġiksaaġlugu. "
4913," So do not let them persuade you to do this, because more than forty of them are lying in ambush for him. They have bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him, and now they are ready, waiting for you to agree to their request.” ","Aglaan aŋiġnagich, qanuq malġukipiaq iñuich sippalik iriqsimaniaqtut utaqqiḷugu Paul.

4915," Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea along with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen by nine o’clock tonight, ","Tavra aŋuyaktit qaukłiata qaitquŋagik malġuk aŋuyaktit atanauraŋik, aasii uqallautivlugik, Itqanaiyaġitchik 200-mik aŋuyaktinik aullaqtuksranik Caesarea-mun, piqasiġḷugich 70 tuttuqpaŋni kakaksiqsuanik, 200-niglu panaliraqtuanik, aasii itqanaitchumausi aullaġumiñaqsiḷusi nainukłaaqpan unnuapak.

4916, and provide mounts for Paul to ride so that he may be brought safely to Felix the governor.” ,"Suli kakaksiġviqaqtitchumagiksi Paul, aasii tikiutilugu sugaluaġnagu Felix-mun kavanauruamun. "
4917, He wrote a letter that went like this:,Tavra aŋuyaktit qaukłiat tuyuksriuŋaruq inna ittuanik. 
4918," So the soldiers, in accordance with their orders, took Paul and brought him to Antipatris during the night. ","Claudias Lysias, Kamanaqtuamun kavanamun Felix-mun, paġlan. "
4919," The next day they let the horsemen go on with him, and they returned to the barracks. ","Unauvva iñuk Jew-guruat tigguġluŋakkaŋat tuqutchaqługu. Ullaŋagitka aŋuyaktiliraqłuŋa aasii annautivlugu, iḷitchuġivlugu Rome-miunun iḷautilaaŋa. "
4920," When the horsemen came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him. ","Aasii kipiġniuġutigivlugu iḷitchuġisukługu pasikkutaat uqautikkusiaŋa, qaġġisiŋagiga uqaqsitaaġviannun. "
4921," When the governor had read the letter, he asked what province he was from. When he learned that he was from Cilicia, ",Iḷitchuġiŋaruŋa sumik piŋaisilaaŋanik tuqqutauyumiñaqtuamik naaggaunnii tigutaaġutauyumiñaqtuamik. Pasiŋagaat apiqqutitigun pitquramiŋniittuatigun. 
4922," he said, “I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive too.” Then he ordered that Paul be kept under guard in Herod’s palace.","Tavra kiliŋmanŋa Jew-guruanun sivunniuġutinivḷugu piyumigivlugu, aullaqtitchuliŋagiga iliŋnun tavrauvvaa. Uqallautiŋagitka pasiriŋi uqautigitquvlugu Paul sivuġaġni."
4923," After five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and an attorney named Tertullus, and they brought formal charges against Paul to the governor. ","Tavra tallimat uvlut pianiŋmata aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat Ananias tikiñŋaruq Caesarea-mun, umialiŋnallu iḷaŋich, pitquraliqirilu atiqaqtuaq Tertullus-mik.

4924," When Paul had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, “We have experienced a lengthy time of peace through your rule, and reforms are being made in this nation through your foresight. ","Tavra Tertullus qaitquraukami, uqautigirraqsiŋagaa Paul uqaqłuni, Kamanaqtuatiin Felix, isumatuvlutin aullarriñiqpich sivisuruamik aŋuyautairrutiqaqtinŋagaatigut, iñugiaktuatigullu iłuaqsruutitigun savautiŋagiptigut anniqsuutauruanik nunauniptiŋnun.

4925," Most excellent Felix, we acknowledge this everywhere and in every way with all gratitude. ","Taamna quyyatigigikput sumiḷiqaa ataramik, aasii quyanaapiaġataġiptigiñ. "
4926," But so that I may not delay you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness. ","Piviksran atuqpaitchuŋitkiga aasii apiġipiaġikpiñ, qiñuiḷḷutin naalaġniḷḷaquvlutin uqaluksraptiŋnik. "
4927," For we have found this man to be a troublemaker, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. ","Una iñuk iḷitchuġigikput iññuqłuuvlugu, ilaan aullaqisuugai tuavaallatit Jew-guruani nunami iluqaani, aullarrauvluniḷu Nazarene-guruanun. "
4928," He even tried to desecrate the temple, so we arrested him. ","Ilaan suli Jew-guŋitchuat itqutiniataŋagai aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmun, salumaiḷḷisauyumiñaqtuat. Aasii tigutaaŋagikput, isivġiġuqługu pitquraptigun. "
4929," When you examine him yourself, you will be able to learn from him about all these things we are accusing him of doing.” ","Aasii qaukłiata aŋuyaktit Lysias-gum upaktuŋagaatigut, aasii piaqłuktaqłuta aullautiŋagaa uvaptiŋniñ. "
4930," The Jews also joined in the verbal attack, claiming that these things were true.",Aasii Lysias piraksriŋaruq Paul pasiriŋi iliŋnun uqaġiaquvlugich. Qanuqitilaaġlugu iliŋnik iḷitchuġiyumiñaġniaqtutin ilaaniñ supayaatigun pasikkutiptiŋnik ilaanun. 
4931," When the governor gestured for him to speak, Paul replied, “Because I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I confidently make my defense. ",Tavra Jew-guruattauq iḷaŋammigaat pasikkutaat uqaqłutiŋ iḷumun innipiaġataqługich pasikkutiŋich.
4932," As you can verify for yourself, not more than twelve days ago I went up to Jerusalem to worship. ","Tavrali kavanam urriqavigimmani Paul uqaquvluni, Paul uqallaŋaruq, Iḷisimaruŋa atanġuŋarutin ukunuŋa nunauruanun ukiuni iñugiaktuani. Quviasupiaġataqtuŋa uqautigigupku patchisaisilaaġa sivuġaġni. "
4933," They did not find me arguing with anyone or stirring up a crowd in the temple courts or in the synagogues or throughout the city, ",Iḷitchuġiniaqtutin iliŋnik qulit malġuk uvlut sipinŋaitchut aŋaiyyuyaqtuaqama Jerusalem-mi. 
4934, nor can they prove to you the things they are accusing me of doing. ,"Jew-guruat iḷitchuġiŋaitkaluaġaanŋa qapiqtaiḷiqatiqaqtilluŋa iñuŋmik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, naaggaunnii iḷitchuġiŋaitkaanŋa piallaktitchiñiaġluŋa iñuŋnik aŋaiyyuviŋiññi, naaggaunnii Jerusalem-mi. "
4935," But I confess this to you, that I worship the God of our ancestors according to the Way (which they call a sect), believing everything that is according to the law and that is written in the prophets. ",Naaggaunnii ukpiġnaqsiḷiġumiñaitkaat iliŋnun paŋmapak pasikkutigikkaqtiŋ uvamnun. 
4936, I have a hope in God (a hope that these men themselves accept too) that there is going to be a resurrection of both the righteous and the unrighteous. ,"Uvvaaglaan una piiḷaaġiyumiñaitkiga iliŋnun.

Ukpiġimmigitka suli iluqaisa aglausimaruat pitqurani qaisauruani Moses-kun, makpiġaaŋiññiḷu Uqaqtiŋisa God-im. "
4937, This is the reason I do my best to always have a clear conscience toward God and toward people. ,"Niġiugimmigiga ukunatuttauq iñuktun God-mun iñupayaat aŋipkaġniaġnivḷugich tuqqunmiñ, nakuuruallu nakuuŋitchuallu. "
4938," After several years I came to bring to my people gifts for the poor and to present offerings, ",Tavraasii iñuuniḷuktuŋa pisuqtilaaptun patchisaiññiaqłuŋa God-mun iñuŋnullu.
4939," which I was doing when they found me in the temple, ritually purified, without a crowd or a disturbance. ","Piitqaaqłuŋa ukiuni iñugiaktuani Jerusalem-miñ, utiŋaruŋa saagaqługich maniich aitchuutit uvagut iñuptiŋnun, aitchuiyaqtuqłuŋalu ikipkautinik. "
4940," But there are some Jews from the province of Asia who should be here before you and bring charges, if they have anything against me. ","Taamna savaaġipkaqtillugu, paqinŋagaanŋa aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, naatchianikłuŋa salummaqtauganikłuŋa pitqurat uqaluatigun. Iñuŋnik iñugiaktuanik piqatiqaŋaitchuŋa pialaŋaitchugullu. "
4941," Or these men here should tell what crime they found me guilty of when I stood before the council, ",Aglaan iḷaŋich Jew-guruat qairuat nunaaqqiŋiñiñ Asia-m tavraniinŋarut. Taipkua iliŋich qairuksraugaluaqtut sivuġaġnun aasii sunik pasikkutiksraqaġumiŋ uvapkun uqautilutin. 
4942, other than this one thing I shouted out while I stood before them: ‘I am on trial before you today concerning the resurrection of the dead.’”,Naaggaunnii ukua iñuich uqaġlich sunik killukuaġutinik iḷitchuġikkamiŋnik uvapkun makitakama uqaqsitaaġviŋmi. 
4943," Then Felix, who understood the facts concerning the Way more accurately, adjourned their hearing, saying, “When Lysias the commanding officer comes down, I will decide your case.” ",Aglaan uvvauna atausiq pisigivlugu nivliutigiŋagiga nipatusivḷuŋa makitakama sivuġaanni. Isivġiġivsiŋa uvlupak pisigivlugu ukpiġniġa tuquŋaruat aŋipkaġniaġnivḷugich.
4944," He ordered the centurion to guard Paul, but to let him have some freedom, and not to prevent any of his friends from meeting his needs.","Tavra Felix iḷisimmaġikł̣uni ukpiqtuaguruat piḷġusiŋiññik, aġiupkaŋagai kasimaruat uqallakłuni, Lysias qaukłiat aŋuyaktit qaikpan sivunniġñiaġiga uqavaaġutiksi. "
4945," Some days later, when Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. ","Tavra piraksriiŋaruq atanauraŋiññik aŋuyaktit Paul qaunaksriqaquvlugu aglaan tigutaaqsimavaiñŋaiġḷugu, avilaitqatiŋiññullu ullallaayumiñaqsiḷugu ikayuġiaqsaqparruŋ."
4946," While Paul was discussing righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became frightened and said, “Go away for now, and when I have an opportunity, I will send for you.” ","Uvlut qavsich pianiŋmata Felix qaiŋaruq nulianiḷu Drusilla, Jew-guruaq aġnaq.

4947," At the same time he was also hoping that Paul would give him money, and for this reason he sent for Paul as often as possible and talked with him. ","Tavra Paul uqaaġataviksillugu iñuich nalaunŋaruakun iñuuruksrautilaaŋannik, qaaŋiulaaŋairrutikullu iñuuniaġniġmik, tikitchumaaqtuakullu isivġiġviksrautikun, Felix sivuuġatchaŋaruq aasii uqallakłuni, Piiḷḷagiñ uvaŋŋa.

4948," After two years had passed, Porcius Festus succeeded Felix, and because he wanted to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.",Tavranivsauq Felix maniḷitquyumaŋagaluaqtuq Paul-mun. Tavra taamna pisigivlugu qaitquraġigaa akulaitchuamik suli uqaluqatigivlugu. 
4949," Now three days after Festus arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. ","Tavra Festus piŋasunik uvlianikami nunamiñi, aullaŋaruq Caesarea-miñ Jerusalem-mun. "
4950, So the chief priests and the most prominent men of the Jews brought formal charges against Paul to him. ,Tavrani aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu Jew-guruallu aullarriŋisa uqautigirraqsiŋagaich pasikkutitiŋ Paul-kun. 
4951," Requesting him to do them a favor against Paul, they urged Festus to summon him to Jerusalem, planning an ambush to kill him along the way. ","Apiġiŋagaat Festus iviġallaglutiŋ Paul Jerusalem-muktitquvlugu, sivunniuŋavlutiŋ tuqutchukługu apqunmi. "
4952," Then Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea, and he himself intended to go there shortly. ","Festus kiuŋagai, Paul tigutaaqtauniaqtuq suli Caesarea-mi, ilaalu sivuniqaġnivḷuni taamuŋa utiġnasuaġniaġnivḷuni. "
4953," “So,” he said, “let your leaders go down there with me, and if this man has done anything wrong, they may bring charges against him.”","Tavraasii uqallautiŋagai, Iñuich aullarrisi Caesarea-muglich maligluŋa, aasii pasiḷugu Paul taamani sumik pigiitchuanik piŋakpan."
4954," After Festus had stayed not more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and the next day he sat on the judgment seat and ordered Paul to be brought. ","Tavra Festus uvliuvsaaŋaruq tallimat piŋasuniḷuunnii naagga qulini uvluni piqatigivlugich, aasii utiqłuni Caesarea-mun. Aasii uvlaakumman, isivġiirraqsiŋaruq aasii piraksriivḷuni Paul qaġġisitquvlugu. "
4955," When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many serious charges that they were not able to prove. ","Tavra Paul qaimman, Jew-guruat Jerusalem-miŋŋaqtuat makitaŋarut avataani, pasiñiapiaġataqługu iñugiaktuatigun sutigun ukpiġnaqsiyumiñaiḷḷaisa pasikkutitiŋ. "
4956," Paul said in his defense, “I have committed no offense against the Jewish law or against the temple or against Caesar.” ","Paul uqallaŋaruq patchisaiññiaġunmiñi, Suuramikunnii pimaqłuŋaitchuŋa kipuqłaglugich Jew-guruat pitquraŋich aŋaiyyuvikpauvlu, naaggaunnii Rome-miut umialgata. "
4957," But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and be tried before me there on these charges?” ","Tavra Festus, iviġallakkumavlugich Jew-guruat, apiġiŋagaa Paul, Utiġukpich Jerusalem-mun, aasii taamani qanuqitilaaqtaulutin sivuqqamni pasikkutiŋisigun iliŋnun? "
4958," Paul replied, “I am standing before Caesar’s judgment seat, where I should be tried. I have done nothing wrong to the Jews, as you also know very well. ","Tavra Paul-gum kiuŋagaa, Makitaruŋa isivġiqsauruksrauvluŋa sivuġaani Rome umialgata piriŋisa. Pigiitchuamik sumik piŋaitchuŋa Jew-guruanun, ilivitchauq iḷisimalluataġmiutin. "
4959," If then I am in the wrong and have done anything that deserves death, I am not trying to escape dying, but if not one of their charges against me is true, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!” ","Tavraasii uvaŋa kipuqłaŋagupkich pitqurat sumiglu piŋaguma tuqurrutauyumiñaqtuamik, apiqsriŋitchuŋa naŋaġuglugu.

4960," Then, after conferring with his council, Festus replied, “You have appealed to Caesar; to Caesar you will go!”","Tavra Festus uqaaqatigiqqaaqługich ikayuqtini isivġiikami, kiuŋagaa, Rome-miut umialganun isivġiqsauyyaġukavich ilaanun aullaġniaqtutin."
4961," After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived at Caesarea to pay their respects to Festus. ","Tavra qavsiñik uvlianiŋmata, umialik Agrippa Bernice-lu tikiñŋaruk Caesarea-mun tautugiaqługu Festus. "
4962," While they were staying there many days, Festus explained Paul’s case to the king to get his opinion, saying, “There is a man left here as a prisoner by Felix. ","Tavra uvliuġaniŋmaŋnik, Festus quliaqtuaġiŋagaa Paul pasikkusiaŋa umialiŋmun, uqaqłuni, Iñuk amma tigutaaqtauvlugu qimaŋakkaŋa Felix-gum. "
4963," When I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me about him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. ","Jerusalem-mukama, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaiḷḷu umialiŋnallu Jew-guruani uqautigiŋagaat pasivḷugu tuqutaullasiñiaqługu apiġivluŋa. "
4964, I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to hand over anyone before the accused had met his accusers face to face and had been given an opportunity to make a defense against the accusation. ,"Aglaalli kiuŋagitka piḷġusiġiŋiññivḷugu Rome-miunun iñuk pasirauruaq tatavsaġumiñaġlugu kasuutiŋaiñŋaan tavruŋa pasiriŋiñun, aasii uqaġviksraqaqtitauluni patchisaisilaamiñik taavrumuuna pasikkusiamigun. "
4965," So after they came back here with me, I did not postpone the case, but the next day I sat on the judgment seat and ordered the man to be brought. ","Tavra iluqaġmiŋ qaimmata uvuŋa, piñatchiaŋaitchuŋa, uvlaakugiññaġman isivġiirraqsiŋaruŋa, aasii piraksriivḷuŋa Paul itqutitquvlugu. "
4966," When his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with any of the evil deeds I had suspected. ",Ilaan akiḷḷiŋi makinnamiŋ pasikkutiksraitkaqsiŋarut sumik pigiitchuamik ilaagun niġiugusivsun. 
4967," Rather they had several points of disagreement with him about their own religion and about a man named Jesus who was dead, whom Paul claimed to be alive. ","Aglaan uqavaaqatigiŋaniġaat Paul ukpiġikkaġmikkun iñukullu tuquŋaruakun atiqaqtuakun Jesus-mik, Paul-gum iñuupiaġataġnikkaŋagun. "
4968," Because I was at a loss how I could investigate these matters, I asked if he were willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there on these charges. ","Sivunniqsausiiñŋaruŋa qanuġluŋa iḷitchuġimmaġiksiyumiñaqtilaamnik tamatkunuuna pasikkutitigun, aasii apiġiŋagaluaġiga Paul Jerusalem-mugugmagaan taamani isivġiqsautquvlugu tamatkunuuna pasikkusiaŋigun. "
4969," But when Paul appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I ordered him to be kept under guard until I could send him to Caesar.” ","Aglaan Paul apiqsrimman Caesar-mun umialganun Rome isivġiquvluni, uvaŋa uqallaŋaruŋa tigutaaqsimatquvlugu aullaqtitchumiñaqsiaġilugu Caesar-mun. "
4970," Agrippa said to Festus, “I would also like to hear the man myself.” “Tomorrow,” he replied, “you will hear him.”","Tavra Agrippa uqallaŋaruq Festus-mun, Tusaasukkaluaġiga iñuk uvamnik. Festus-gum kiuŋagaa, Uvlaakun naalaktuaġisigiñ."
4971," So the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp and entered the audience hall, along with the senior military officers and the prominent men of the city. When Festus gave the order, Paul was brought in. ",Tavra uvlaakumman Agrippa-lu Bernice-lu qaiŋaruk kamanaqsisapiaqłutiŋ qiññamiŋni.

4972," Then Festus said, “King Agrippa, and all you who are present here with us, you see this man about whom the entire Jewish populace petitioned me both in Jerusalem and here, shouting loudly that he ought not to live any longer. ","Tavra Festus uqallaŋaruq, Umialiik Agrippa iluqapayauravsiḷu uvaniittuasii piqatigivluta, tautukkiksi uvva iñuk iluqaġmiŋ Jew-guruat maaniḷu Jerusalem-miḷu uqautigiŋakkaŋat uvamnun pasivḷugu. Saqłaŋarut iñuuruksrauŋaiġñivḷugu. "
4973," But I found that he had done nothing that deserved death, and when he appealed to His Majesty the Emperor, I decided to send him. ","Aasii iḷitchuġiŋaitchuŋa sumik ilaan savaaŋanik tuqqutauyumiñaqtuamik. Aasii isivġiqumman Caesar-mun umialiŋmun, sivunniutiŋagiga taamuŋaqtitchukługu. "
4974," But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after this preliminary hearing I may have something to write. ","Aglaan uvva sumik nalupqinaitchuamik pasikkunmik Paul-kun tuyuutiksraitchuŋa umialimñun.

4975, For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner without clearly indicating the charges against him.”,Qanuq qiññaqaqtuq uvamnun iruġnaġmatun aullaqtitchiñiq tigutaaqtamik Rome-mun nalupqinaisuŋaġnagu pasikkutauruaq ilaanun.
4976," So Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” Then Paul held out his hand and began his defense:","Agrippa-m uqallautiŋagaa Paul, Uqaġumiñaqsipkaqtaurutin uqautigilutin iliŋnik. Tavra Paul isaaqługich argagni uqarraqsiŋaruq patchisaiññiġmigun inna. "
4977," “Regarding all the things I have been accused of by the Jews, King Agrippa, I consider myself fortunate that I am about to make my defense before you today, ","Umialiik Agrippa, Isummatigiruŋa uvamnik piḷḷuataġasugaluŋa sivuġaŋiutiyumiñaġniqama iliŋnun uvlupak, uqautigiyumiñaqługu patchisaisilaaġa iluqaisigun Jew-guruat pasikkutiŋisigun uvamnun. "
4978, because you are especially familiar with all the customs and controversial issues of the Jews. Therefore I ask you to listen to me patiently. ,Qanukkiataŋ iḷisimmaaġiksutin iluqaiññik Jew-guruat piḷġusiŋiññik uqaġlaqutigisuukkaŋiññiglu. Taamna pisigivlugu apiġigikpiñ naalaġnitquvlutin uvamnik qiñuiġḷutin.
4979," Now all the Jews know the way I lived from my youth, spending my life from the beginning among my own people and in Jerusalem. ",Iluqaġmiŋ Jew-guruat iḷisimagaat qanuq iñuuniaġusiġa nutaġaunnamniñqaŋa. Iḷisimarut isuaniñqaŋa iñuuŋatilaamnik uvaŋa nanmiñiq nunamni Jerusalem-miḷu. 
4980," They know, because they have known me from time past, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion, I lived as a Pharisee. ","Uqaġutuaġumiŋ nalaullugu iḷisimakkaqtiŋ, iḷisimaŋammiut isuaniñqaŋa iḷautilaamnik kipuqłayunaitchuanun Pharisee-ñun piḷġusivsiŋñi. "
4981," And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our ancestors, ",Aasiuvva paŋmapak makitaruŋa uvani qanuqitilaaqtauvluŋa pisigivlugu aŋŋiñ niġiuqsruutaa God-im maŋŋuuptiŋnun. 
4982," a promise that our twelve tribes hope to attain as they earnestly serve God night and day. Concerning this hope the Jews are accusing me, Your Majesty! ","Taavrumiŋa qulit malġuk maŋŋuuvut niġiuktuat kipiġniuqłutiŋ tikiutisukłutiŋ, aŋaiyyuuqłutiŋ God-mun unnuamiḷu uvlumiḷu. Taavrumuunaasiuvva Umialiik, Jew-guruat pasigaanŋa. "
4983, Why do you people think it is unbelievable that God raises the dead? ,Suvlusiasiuvva ilivsi siġḷiġnaġivisiuŋ ukpiġniksraq God-mun aŋipkaġumiñaqtilaaŋat tuquŋaruat? 
4984," Of course, I myself was convinced that it was necessary to do many things hostile to the name of Jesus the Nazarene. ",Uvamniḷiuvva isumapiaġataŋagaluaqtuaŋaa taimani qanusiġairuksraunasugaluŋa ukpiqtuanik Jesus-mun Nazareth-miumun. 
4985," And that is what I did in Jerusalem: Not only did I lock up many of the saints in prisons by the authority I received from the chief priests, but I also cast my vote against them when they were sentenced to death. ","Tainnaasii piŋaruŋa Jerusalem-mi. Aitchuusiaqaqłuŋa ataniġnaqunmik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋniñ, God-im iñuŋi iñugiaktuat tigutaaŋagitka, suli tuqutauruksraġuġmata iḷaalliqsuutimmiraqtuŋa piyuaqłiqsuanun. "
4986," I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to force them to blaspheme. Because I was so furiously enraged at them, I went to persecute them even in foreign cities.","Tatavsaġayuŋagitkalu iñugiaktuani Jew-guruat aŋaiyyuvipayauraŋiññi, piiḷaaġipkaġniaqługu ukpiġutaat, suli suammautivaił̣ł̣ugich aullaġaqtuŋa uŋasiksuanun iniqpaŋnun nagliksaaqtitchukługich."
4987," “While doing this very thing, as I was going to Damascus with authority and complete power from the chief priests, ","Tainna piyaqtuqłuŋa, Damascus-mun aullaŋaruŋa ataniġnaqusiraqłuŋa piraksriusiaqaqłuŋalu aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋniñ. "
4988," about noon along the road, Your Majesty, I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining everywhere around me and those traveling with me. ","Umialiik, uvluq qitiqqaġman tautuŋagiga iglaullapta qaumaniq qiḷaŋmiñ, qaummaġił̣haaġniqsuaq siqiñiġmiñ, qaummatittuaq avatimnun taapkunuŋalu iglauqatimnun. "
4989," When we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? You are hurting yourself by kicking against the goads.’ ","Tavra iluqata ulġuanikapta nunamun, tusaaŋaruŋa nipimik uqaqtuamik uvamnun Jew-guruat uqausiatigun, Saul, Saul, summan nagliksaaqtitpiŋa?

4990," So I said, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ And the Lord replied, ‘I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. ","Tavra uqallaŋaruŋa, Kiuvich ququularuatiin uvamnik? Aasii Ataniq uqallaŋaruq, Jesus-guruŋa nagliksaaqtitan. "
4991," But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for this reason, to designate you in advance as a servant and witness to the things you have seen and to the things in which I will appear to you. ","Aasii makittin, niptaġvigiŋagikpiñ kivgaksraqtaaġisukłutin; quliaqtuaġutiniaġitin iñuich tautuŋaniḷuŋa uvlupak, suli quliaqtuaġutilugich sunik iḷitchuġipkaġumaakkamnik iliŋnun. "

4993," to open their eyes so that they turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’","Tavra iḷisautiniaġitin tusaayugaaġiksuanik mumikkumiñaqsiḷugich taaqtuamiñ qaummaġiksuamun, aŋalatinŋaiġḷutiŋ Satan-mun aglaan God-mun, ukpiliġḷutiŋ piḷuutitiŋ suliqutigiŋaiqsautqulugich, suli iḷaliutiyumiñaqsiḷutiŋ God-im iñuksraqtaaŋiñun."
4994," “Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, ","Tavra Umialiik Agrippa, kamagiŋagiga qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruaq qiñiqtuuraaġa. "
4995," but I declared to those in Damascus first, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds consistent with repentance.

4997," I have experienced help from God to this day, and so I stand testifying to both small and great, saying nothing except what the prophets and Moses said was going to happen: ","Uvlupaŋmun-aglaan God-im ikayuŋagaaŋa, aasiuvva makitaruŋa uvani quliaqtuaġivlugu iḷisimakkaġa iḷumun ittuaq, iñupayaanun kamanaitchuallu kamanaqtuallu ativlugich.

4999," As Paul was saying these things in his defense, Festus exclaimed loudly, “You have lost your mind, Paul! Your great learning is driving you insane!” ","Tavra Paul uqaġniaqtillugu patchisairrunmigun, Festus-gum nipatusivḷuni uqallautiŋagaa, Paul kinnaġuqtutin uvva, iḷitchivaiñŋavlutin kinnaġuutigiaqsigiñ.

5001," For the king knows about these things, and I am speaking freely to him, because I cannot believe that any of these things has escaped his notice, for this was not done in a corner.

5003," Agrippa said to Paul, “In such a short time are you persuading me to become a Christian?” ","Tavra Agrippa uqallaŋaruq Paul-mun, Akkupauraq Christ-miuġuqtitchukłuŋa isumavich? "
5004," Paul replied, “I pray to God that whether in a short or a long time not only you but also all those who are listening to me today could become such as I am, except for these chains.”","Tavrali Paul-gum kiuŋagaa, Sivikitkaluaqpan naagga sivisunaaġaluaqpan, aŋaiyyutigigaluaġiga God-mun iliviḷḷu iluqaġmiglu naalaġniruat uvamnik uvlupak ukpiliqugaluaqługich uvaptun, tigutaaqtauŋisiññaġlusi uvaptun."

5006," and as they were leaving they said to one another, “This man is not doing anything deserving death or imprisonment.” ","aasii anianikamiŋ uqaurrutiŋarut avanmun, Iñuk iŋña piŋitchuq sumik tuqurrutauyumiñaqtuamik naaggaunnii tigutaaqsimmatiksramik. "

5008," When it was decided we would sail to Italy, they handed over Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius. ","Tavra sivunniutaumman umiaqpagaqtuksraġuqłuta Italy-mun aitchuutigiŋagaat Paul iḷaŋiḷḷu allat tigutaaqtat Julius-mun, atanauraŋannun Rome-miut aŋuyaktiŋisa atiqaqtuat Augustan-gum aŋuyaktiŋiñik. "
5009," We went on board a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to various ports along the coast of the province of Asia and put out to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. ","Ikuŋarugut umiaqpaŋmun Adramyttium-miŋŋaqtuamiñ aullaqsiññaaġuġman nutqaaġaġviŋiññun nunaaqqiŋiñi Asia-m, aasii tiŋinnaarraqsivḷuta.

5010," The next day we put in at Sidon, and Julius, treating Paul kindly, allowed him to go to his friends so they could provide him with what he needed. ","Uvlaakumman tikiñŋarugut Sidon-mun.

5012," After we had sailed across the open sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we put in at Myra in Lycia. ","Tavraasii tiŋilġaiganikapta ikaaqługu taġiuq akianiittuaq Cilicia-m Pamphylia-vlu, tikiñŋarugut Myra-mun Lycia-miittuamun. "
5013," There the centurion found a ship from Alexandria sailing for Italy, and he put us aboard it. ","Tavrani aŋuyaktit atanauraŋat iḷitchuġiŋaruq umiaqpaŋmik qairuamik Alexandria-miñ aullaqsaġumaruamik Italy-mun, aasii ikipkaqłuta taavrumuŋa umiaqpaŋmun."
5014," We sailed slowly for many days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus. Because the wind prevented us from going any farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. ","Tiŋilġaqsiŋarugut sukaiḷaamik anuqłiqpaił̣ł̣uni uvluni iñugiaktuani, arguġianniuqłuta tikiḷġiñaŋarugut akianun nunaaqqim Cnidus.

5015, With difficulty we sailed along the coast of Crete and came to a place called Fair Havens that was near the town of Lasea.,"Siñiqsraqtuaqługu nunam siñaa siġġaġnaġaluaŋŋaan, tikiñŋarugut inimun atiqaqtuamun Qamannirviŋmik, qaniŋani iniqpak inmiruaq Lasea."
5016," Since considerable time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous because the fast was already over, Paul advised them, ","Taavrumani nunaaqqimi uvliuŋarugut iñugiaktuanik, navianaqsiḷġataqtillugu iglauniksraq ukiaqłuni Jew-guruat uvluq niġiḷairviat qaaŋianiŋavluni.

5017," “Men, I can see the voyage is going to end in disaster and great loss not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.” ","Aŋutiit, iḷitchuġiruŋa aullaġupta uvaŋŋa navianaġniaqtuq iglauniqput, maqutauniaqtut usiavullu umiaqpaglu, iḷaanniḷu suksraunniksraqput. "
5018, But the centurion was more convinced by the captain and the ship’s owner than by what Paul said. ,"Tavra aŋuyaktit atanauraŋata kamagiłhaaŋagik umiaqpaum umialgatalu iñuatalu uqaluŋik, kamagigaluaġnagu Paul uqalua. "
5019," Because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there. They hoped that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there. ","Tavra qamannisimavik umiaqpaŋmun nayukkaŋat ukiiviksraġiiñŋaruq, iñugiagniqsrat ayaksaaġuŋarut taġiumun tavraŋŋa, tikiḷaiñmagaaqsaġukługu Phoenix piyumiñaġumiŋ.

5020," When a gentle south wind sprang up, they thought they could carry out their purpose, so they weighed anchor and sailed close along the coast of Crete. ","Tavra uŋallaaġuġman isumavlutiŋ sivunniurriŋ nalaunniaġasugalugu, kisaq nuqinŋagaat aasii tiŋilġaigaqsivḷutiŋ siñiqsraqługu Crete, siñiqsraurapiaġataqługu nunam siñaa. "
5021," Not long after this, a hurricane-force wind called the northeaster blew down from the island. ","Tavra akuniḷitchiaŋitchuq anuġiqpak nigiqłuk, anuqqałłaŋaruq qikiqtam tuŋaaniñ. "
5022," When the ship was caught in it and could not head into the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. ","Tavra umiaqpak anuġiqpaum nalaunmagu arguġumiñaiñŋarugut sanmiḷugu anuġi, iḷatchiŋarugut tiksiqł̣uta. "
5023," As we ran under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we were able with difficulty to get the ship’s boat under control. ",Aasii iglauŋarugut qamanġagun qikiqtauram atiqaqtuam Cauda-mik. Tavra siġġaqivluta anayanaiyaŋagikput umiaqpaum umiuraŋa. 
5024," After the crew had hoisted it aboard, they used supports to undergird the ship. Fearing they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the sea anchor, thus letting themselves be driven along. ","Ikuaniŋmarruŋ umiuraq, anniqsuġniḷuksaaqsiŋagaat payaŋaiyaqsaavlugu akłunaanik umiaqpak.

5025," The next day, because we were violently battered by the storm, they began throwing the cargo overboard, ","Tavra anuġi suamaruaq anuqłiqsillugusuli, uvlutqiŋman siqqairraqsiŋarut umiaqpaum usiaŋiñik. "
5026, and on the third day they threw the ship’s gear overboard with their own hands. ,Uvluk piŋayuagniasii siqqarraqsiŋagaich saatqutiŋi umiaqpaum. 
5027," When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days and a violent storm continued to batter us, we finally abandoned all hope of being saved.","Tavra uvluni iñugiaktuani tautulaiñŋagivut siqiñiġlu uvluġiallu, anuġi anuqłipiaġataqłuni. Kiisaimmaa iñuuyumiñaiġasukkiutivugut."
5028," Since many of them had no desire to eat, Paul stood up among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not put out to sea from Crete, thus avoiding this damage and loss. ","Tavra aŋutit sivisuruamik niġiḷaitkaluaġmata, Paul makinŋaruq sivuġaannun, aasii uqallautivlugich, Aŋutiit, kamagiyumiñaŋagaluaġivsiŋa aullaqusaaŋiññavsi Crete-miñ aasii siqqaiŋiḷḷuta iluqaiññik usiaptiŋnik. "
5029," And now I advise you to keep up your courage, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only the ship will be lost. ","Aasii paŋmapak ipiqtusuŋaiqugivsi, qanuq iḷaŋiġñiaŋitchusi atausiuramik-unnii, aglaan umiaqpaiyaġniaqtugut. "
5030, For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve came to me ,"Qanuq unnuapak makitaŋaruq saniqqamni isaġulga God-im ukpiġikkaġma, aŋaiyyuvigisuukkaġmalu, "
5031," and said, ‘Do not be afraid, Paul! You must stand before Caesar, and God has graciously granted you the safety of all who are sailing with you.’ ","aasii uqallautivluŋa, Iqsiñak Paul, qanuq tikitchuksraurutin Rome-mun, aasii Caesar-m isivġiġḷutin.

5032," Therefore keep up your courage, men, for I have faith in God that it will be just as I have been told. ","Ipiqtusuŋaiġitchiasii, aŋutiit, qanuq ukpiġutiqaqtuŋa God-mun nalaupiaġataġniaqtilaaŋa kilgusiaġa. "
5033, But we must run aground on some island.”,Aglaan tipiniaġaatigut qikiqtamun.
5034," When the fourteenth night had come, while we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected they were approaching some land. ","Akimiaġuutaiḷaŋŋuġmata unnuat tiksiġñivut anuqłiuqłuta taġiumi Mediterranean-mi, unnuaq qitiqqaqpalliġman sivuqłich iḷimatchaŋarut qalliñasugalutiŋ nunamun. "
5035, They took soundings and found the water was twenty fathoms deep; when they had sailed a little farther they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms deep. ,"Tavra kiviuqsraŋarut aasii iḷitchuġivlutiŋ iñuiññaqtun isaŋniqtun ititilaaŋanik, ayuuqtaallaqqaaqłutiŋ kiviuqsravsaaŋarut aasii akimiaq isaŋniqtun ititilaanikłuni. "
5036," Because they were afraid that we would run aground on the rocky coast, they threw out four anchors from the stern and wished for day to appear. ","Tavra anayatchakłutiŋ umiaqpakput apuġasugalugu uyaġagruanun, niŋinŋagaich sisamat kitchat aquagun, aasii uvluqsiigaqsivḷutiŋ. "
5037," Then when the sailors tried to escape from the ship and were lowering the ship’s boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to put out anchors from the bow, ","Tavra sivuqłich pigruġumavlutiŋ umiaqpaŋmiñ, niŋinŋagaat umiuraq immamun, kisaġniaŋŋuaqsaqłutiŋ umiaqpaum sivuagun. "
5038," Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men stay with the ship, you cannot be saved.” ","Paul uqallautiŋagai aŋuyaktit atanauraŋat aŋuyaktillu, Ukua aŋutit umiaqpaŋmiinŋisuaqpata iñuulirauyumiñaitchusi. "
5039, Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it drift away.,Tavrani aŋuyaktit kivluŋagaich akłunaaŋi umiuram aasii saġvaqtiłługu.
5040," As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day you have been in suspense and have gone without food; you have eaten nothing. ","Tavra uvluq qausaaqsivalliġman, Paul niġiḷḷaqupiaŋagai umiaqpagaqtit uqallakłuni, Uvlupak akimiaġuutaiḷaŋŋuqtut uvlut, aasii iluqasi tainnatun sivisutigiruamik niġiuraŋaitchusi. "
5041," Therefore I urge you to take some food, for this is important for your survival. For not one of you will lose a hair from his head.” ","Tavra niġiḷḷaqupiaġivsi, sayaniktaaġumausi iñuullasisaġlusi. Atausiuraq-unnii nusaqsi niaquvsiññi tammaġniaŋitchuq."
5042," After he said this, Paul took bread and gave thanks to God in front of them all, broke it, and began to eat. ","Taamna uqallausiġianikamiuŋ, Paul-gum tiguŋagaa punniq, aasii quyyavigiqqaaqługu God takkuanni, avikługu niġirraqsiŋaruq. "
5043, So all of them were encouraged and took food themselves. ,Tavrani iluqaġmiŋ qapiŋaisaaqtauŋarut aasii niġivḷutiktauq iliŋich. 
5044, (We were in all two hundred seventy-six persons on the ship.) ,Iluqata katiłłuta iñugiaktilaaqput 276 umiaqpaum iñuŋi. 
5045," When they had eaten enough to be satisfied, they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat into the sea.","Tavra niġisuiġataqamiŋ, uqigḷiḷiŋagaat umiaqpak igiłługich palauvaksrat taġiumun."
5046," When day came, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, where they decided to run the ship aground if they could. ","Tavra uvluġman, umiaqpagaqtit iḷisaġiŋaitkaat nuna, aglaan nalunaigiŋagaat puviaq naqittuamik siñilik, sivunniutiŋagaat piñaġumiñaqpan umiaqpaŋmik apuġaksaaġvigisaġukługu. "
5047," So they slipped the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the linkage that bound the steering oars together. Then they hoisted the foresail to the wind and steered toward the beach. ",Tavra ilaisa kivluŋagaich kitchat akłunaaŋich qimakługich kitchat immamun.

5048," But they encountered a patch of crosscurrents and ran the ship aground; the bow stuck fast and could not be moved, but the stern was being broken up by the force of the waves. ","Tavra nalaułługu ikkalġuq ikkalġisinŋagaat umiaqpak, sivua kaliviłłuni aulayyallaiŋaruq, aasii aqua siquminŋagaa ulivrigaqtuam taġium."
5049, Now the soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners so that none of them would escape by swimming away. ,"Aŋuyaktit sivunniŋarut tuquġaġukługich tigutaaqtapayaurat, iḷaanni nalliŋich puumillutiŋ annakkasugalugich. "
5050," But the centurion, wanting to save Paul’s life, prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land, ","Tavra aŋuyaktit atanauraŋata annautiyumavlugu Paul, taŋŋiqsinŋaitkaa sivunniutaat.

5060," For God, whom I serve in my spirit by preaching the gospel of his Son, is my witness that I continually remember you ","God, savautikkaġa pisuqtilaaptun tusaayugaaġiksuaŋagun Iġñiŋan, iḷisimaruq ataramik itqaumatilaamnik ilivsiññik aŋaiyyutimni. "

5063," that is, that we may be mutually comforted by one another’s faith, both yours and mine. ","Taamna sivuniqaqtuq, uvagut avanmun qapiŋaisaaġutiluta ukpiġutiptigun. "
5064," I do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, that I often intended to come to you (and was prevented until now), so that I may have some fruit even among you, just as I already have among the rest of the Gentiles. ","Aniqatiit, iḷisimatqugivsi ataramik qaiyumagaluaġaqtuŋa ilivsiññun alġaqsruisukłuŋa, tautullasiḷuŋa ukpiqtuanik suaŋasiḷaaqtuanik, piḷuusiqirauruaniglu annaurrauruanik, piŋaruatuttauq allani nunani.

5067," For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is God’s power for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. ","Kanŋugiŋitkiga tusaayugaaġiksuaq qanuq taavrumuuna God-im annautillagaa kiñaliqaa ukpiqtuaq tusaayugaaġiksuamik, qaiqqaaŋaruaq Jew-guruanun, aasii aquvatigun Jew-guŋitchuanun. "
5068," For the righteousness of God is revealed in the gospel from faith to faith, just as it is written, “The righteous by faith will live.”","Taavrumuuna tusaayugaaġiksuakun God-im nalaunŋatqutaa salapqiŋaruq iñupayaami ukpiqtuami tusaayugaaġiksuamik, aglausimaruatun inna, “Iñuk nalaunŋasirauruaq ukpiġunmigun iñuuniaqtuq isuitchuamun.”"
5069," For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of people who suppress the truth by their unrighteousness, ","Qanuq God-im qinnautaa salapqiqsuq qiḷaŋmiñ iñupayaanun god-aiḷaqtuanun piḷuktuanullu, tamatkunuŋa piñaiḷutchiqsuiruanun iḷumun ittuamik. "

5071," For since the creation of the world his invisible attributes – his eternal power and divine nature – have been clearly seen, because they are understood through what has been made. So people are without excuse. ","Taimaŋŋaqaŋa God-im savaŋmagich supayaat, iñuich qiñiŋagaich sut God-im savaaŋi, suli iḷisimavlugu iñuutilaaŋa suaŋŋatiqaqłuni kamanaqtuamik isuitchuamun.

5073," Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools ","Uqavigaaqłutiŋ isumatunivḷutiŋ isumalluaġiiḷiŋarut, "
5074, and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for an image resembling mortal human beings or birds or four-footed animals or reptiles. ,"suli aŋaiyyuniq tuqulaitchuamun God-mun simmausiqł̣ugu aŋaiyyuvigivlugich iñuuraqpaliat tuqullaruatun iñuktun, tiŋmiatullu niġrutitullu nimiġiatullu."
5075," Therefore God gave them over in the desires of their hearts to impurity, to dishonor their bodies among themselves. ","Taamna pisigivlugu, God-im ilaisituuqtinŋagai pisuutaatigun.

5077," For this reason God gave them over to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged the natural sexual relations for unnatural ones, ",Taamna pisigivlugu God-im ilaisituuqtinŋagai pigiitchuanun kipiġniuġutiŋiññun. Aġnaŋisa simmausiqł̣ugu nutim piḷġusiuruaq atugaġivlugich timitiŋ aġnauqanmiŋnun. 
5078, and likewise the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed in their passions for one another.

5085, Now we know that God’s judgment is in accordance with truth against those who practice such things. ,Iḷisimarugut God isivġiisuuruq nalaunŋaruakun tamatkuniŋa piḷuksiruanik. 
5086," And do you think, whoever you are, when you judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape God’s judgment? ","Isumanak God-mun isivġiġñiaġasugalugich allat kisiisa, piḷuksiruat tamatkunuuna, aasii isivġiŋiḷḷutin tamatkuniŋaptauq piḷuksisiqaqavich. "
5087," Or do you have contempt for the wealth of his kindness, forbearance, and patience, and yet do not know that God’s kindness leads you to repentance?

5094, For there is no partiality with God. ,Qanuq God atiruq iñupayaanun.
5095," For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law. ","Iñuich iluqaġmiŋ piḷuksiŋarut naluvlugich God-im pitquraŋi Moses-mun qaisaŋi, suksrauniaqtut. Aglaan God-im isivġiġñiaŋitkai taapkua pitqurat uqaluatigun.

5097," For whenever the Gentiles, who do not have the law, do by nature the things required by the law, these who do not have the law are a law to themselves. ","Jew-guŋitchuat naluruat God-im pitquraŋiñik nalaunniġmatigik taapkua pitqurat iñuuniaqłutiŋ isumamiŋni nalaunŋanasugikkaġmikkun, inmiŋnun pitquraliuġmatun piut, "
5098," They show that the work of the law is written in their hearts, as their conscience bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or else defend them, ","aglaan salapqiŋagaat puttuqsrisilaaqtiŋ God-im pitquraŋiñik, iḷitchuġipkairuanik nalautilaaŋanik naagga pigiitchualiqitilaaŋannik, suli isumaalutchaktiłługich, naagga patchisaiññialavlutiŋ.

5099," on the day when God will judge the secrets of human hearts, according to my gospel through Christ Jesus.","Iñupayaat isivġiqsauniaqtut taivrumani uvlumi, God-im tilikpagu Christ Jesus isivġiqulugich iluqaisa nalunautchiaŋich iñuich. Tavra taapkua iḷagigaich tusaayugaaġiksuam alġaqsruutigikkaġama."
5100, But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast of your relationship to God ,"Tavra ilivsi, Jew-guniraġaaqtuasii, naamarualirusi piqaqavsi God-im pitquraŋiñik qaisaŋiñik Moses-mun. Uqavigaaqtusi God God-iginivḷugu. "
5101," and know his will and approve the superior things because you receive instruction from the law, ","Iḷisimaniqsusi qanuq God-mun iñuutqutilaavsiññik, God-ivlu nakuułhaaqtuanik iñuutqutiŋiñik iḷisausiaqaŋavlusi ilaan pitquraŋiñik. "
5102," and if you are convinced that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness, ","Nalupqisuŋipiaqtusi iḷisimanivḷusi God-im pitquraŋiñik, iḷisautiyumiñaqługich kaŋiqsisaitchuat pitquranun, aasii iḷisautilugich kaŋiqsipkaġlugich. "
5103," an educator of the senseless, a teacher of little children, because you have in the law the essential features of knowledge and of the truth – ","Iḷisautiyumiñaġniġisi naluruat God-im pitquraŋiñik, tamatkualu miqłiqtutun ittuat kaŋiqsisimiŋni pitquraŋiñik God-im. Tavra piginiqavsigik God-im pitquraŋi kaŋiqsiŋapiaġniqsusi qanuq God-mun iñuutqupiaġataqtilaaŋannik iñuich. "
5104," therefore you who teach someone else, do you not teach yourself? You who preach against stealing, do you steal? ","Iḷisaurriyumiñaqsiŋaniġuvsi allanik iñuŋnik, summan iḷisautisuŋitpisi ilivsiññun? Uqallaurrisuuruasii iñuŋnik, Tiglignak. Ilivsi tigliguuvisi? "

5106, You who boast in the law dishonor God by transgressing the law! ,"Uqavigaaqtusi iḷisimanivḷugich God-im pitquraŋi qaisaŋi Moses-mun naaggauvva kanŋunaqsiḷiġaġigiksi God, kamagiŋiññavsigik pitquraŋi. "
5107," For just as it is written, “the name of God is being blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you.”",“Taamna pisigivlugu nunam iñuŋisa uqamaqłuutigigaat God.” Tainna aglausimaruq Bible-ni.
5108," For circumcision has its value if you practice the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision. ","Nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaguvsi God-im iñuksraqtaaŋiñun iḷaliutilusi Jew-guruasii, aasii kamagivlugich God-im pitquraŋi, anniqsuusiaqaqtusi.

5109," Therefore if the uncircumcised man obeys the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision? ","Allaaguttauq, Jew-guŋitchuaġli iñuuniqpan God-im pitquraŋi kamagilugich, ilaa kisiuqatauniaqtuq God-im iñuksraqtaaŋiñun, nalunaiñŋutaitkaluaŋŋaġmi Jew-guruat nalunaiñŋutaŋannik. "
5110," And will not the physically uncircumcised man who keeps the law judge you who, despite the written code and circumcision, transgress the law? ","Aasii taapkua Jew-guŋitchuat, nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaitchuat, kamagimmatigik God-im pitquraŋi pasiñiaġaasi piḷuusiqiniḷusi nalunaiñŋutaqaqtuasii, qanuq kamagiŋiññavsigik God-im pitquraŋi aglausimaruat. "
5111," For a person is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision something that is outward in the flesh, ",Pisigigiññaġlugu taiguutiqaġniqsi Jew-mik Jew-gupiaġataŋitchusi. Iḷagiŋitkaasi God-im iñuksraqtaaŋisa pisigigiññaġlugu God-im nalunaiñŋutchiutaa ilivsiññun. 
5112," but someone is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart by the Spirit and not by the written code. This person’s praise is not from people but from God.","Jew-gupiaqpaalluktuq iñuk kamaksriḷḷaturuaq God-mik ataramik.

5113," Therefore what advantage does the Jew have, or what is the value of circumcision? ","Tamatkua tainna itpata, sumik anniqsuusiaqaqpa Jew-guniq? Sumik anniqsuusiaqaqpa piqaġniq God-im nalunaiñŋutchiutaanik? "
5114," Actually, there are many advantages. First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. ","Atqunaq anniqsuusiaqaġnaqtuq Jew-guniq. Sivulliġmi, God-im aitchuŋagai Jew-guruat aglausimaruanik pitquranik Moses-kun. "
5115," What then? If some did not believe, does their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God? ","Jew-guruat iḷaŋich ukpiġutaitkaluaqpata kamagilaiḷḷugich God-im pitquraŋi, ukpiġutairrutaata God taŋŋiipkaġumiñaitparruŋ unniqsuqłiisiŋiñik tamatkunuŋa ukpiqtuanun? "
5116," Absolutely not! Let God be proven true, and every human being shown up as a liar, just as it is written: “so that you will be justified in your words and will prevail when you are judged.”","Naaggapiaġataq. Iñupayaaq saglusuugaluaġniqpan, God sagluyumiñaitchuq. Bible-ni aglausimaruq God-ikun inna,"
5117," But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? The God who inflicts wrath is not unrighteous, is he? (I am speaking in human terms.) ","Iñuich iḷaŋich killukun uqaġuurut inna, Uvagurguuq piḷuksigupta, tautuktinniaġivut iñuich God-im nalaunŋataanik, tavraasii uqallakłutiŋ nakuuniḷugu piḷuksiruni.

5138," For no one is declared righteous before him by the works of the law, for through the law comes the knowledge of sin. ",
5139, But now apart from the law the righteousness of God (which is attested by the law and the prophets) has been disclosed – ,
5140," namely, the righteousness of God through the faithfulness of Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction, ",
5141, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. ,
5142, But they are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. ,
5143," God publicly displayed him at his death as the mercy seat accessible through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because God in his forbearance had passed over the sins previously committed. ",
5144," This was also to demonstrate his righteousness in the present time, so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who lives because of Jesus’ faithfulness.",
5145," Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded! By what principle? Of works? No, but by the principle of faith! ",
5146, For we consider that a person is declared righteous by faith apart from the works of the law. ,
5147," Or is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the Gentiles too? Yes, of the Gentiles too! ",
5148," Since God is one, he will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith. ",
5149, Do we then nullify the law through faith? Absolutely not! Instead we uphold the law.,

5153," Now to the one who works, his pay is not credited due to grace but due to obligation. ","Tavra iñuk nalaunŋasipkaqtaullakpan pisigilugich piḷġusiḷḷuataŋi akiññaktaaġiniġaa nalaunŋasisiñi, iñuktun savakłuni akiññaktuatun. Aitchuusiaġiŋitkaa, aglaan akiḷiusiaġigaa. "
5154," But to the one who does not work, but believes in the one who declares the ungodly righteous, his faith is credited as righteousness.","Aasiiḷi iñuk nalaunŋasiñiataŋitchuaq piḷġusiḷḷuatamigun aglaan ukpiqtuaq God-mun, nalaunŋarualigaa God-im ukpiġutaa pisigivlugu. God-im nalaunŋasiḷḷagai piḷuusiqirit ukpiliġmata. "
5155, So even David himself speaks regarding the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:,"Taamna uvva David uqautigiŋagaa Bible-ni uqallakami, iñuk quviasuguuruq God-im nalaunŋasipkaġmani piqutigiŋaiqł̣ugich piḷġusiḷḷuataŋi. David uqallaŋaruq inna,"
5156," “Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; ","Taapkua David uqaluŋi quviasaaġusiat inŋitchut kisiŋiññun tamatkunuŋa nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaruanun God-mun piksraqtaaguniŋatigun, aglaallu Jew-guŋitchuanun. Qanuq Bible uqaqtut Abraham nalaunŋasipkaqtaunivḷugu pisigivlugu ukpiġutaa. "
5157, blessed is the one  against whom the Lord will never count sin.”,Abraham nalaunŋasiŋagaa God-im nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaiñŋaan timimiñi. 
5158," Is this blessedness then for the circumcision or also for the uncircumcision? For we say, “faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.” ","Abraham nalunaiñŋutaŋa iḷitchuqqutauŋaruq ilaa God-mun nalaunŋasipkaqtauganiŋatilaaŋanik pisigivlugu ukpiġutaa. God sivunniŋaruq tainna, malġuk sivuniġivlugik. Sivulliġmi, Abraham aapatun ittuq iluqaiññun Jew-guŋitchuanun, tuvrautiruanun tuvraaksriutaanun, ukpiġunmikkun nalaunŋasipkaqtauruanun God-im sivuġaani. "
5159," How then was it credited to him? Was he circumcised at the time, or not? No, he was not circumcised but uncircumcised! ","Igḷuani, ilaa aapauruq iluqaiññun Jew-guruanun kisian pisigisuŋaġnagu nalunaiñŋutaŋat God-mun iñuginiḷugich, aglaan ukpiqtuanun God-mun, Abraham-tun ukpiġutiqaqtuatun God-mun nalunaiñŋutchiŋaiñŋaġmi."
5160," And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised, so that he would become the father of all those who believe but have never been circumcised, that they too could have righteousness credited to them. ","God-im unniqsuqłiiŋagaa Abraham kiŋuniŋiḷu kiŋuvaannagniaġnivḷugich nunamik. Taamna unniqsuqłiiñ unniqsuqłiisauŋaitchuq God-im qaiñmagich aglausimaruat pitqurani Moses-kun, aglaan unniqsuqłiisauŋaruq Abraham-mun God-im nalaunŋasipkaġmagu ukpiġutaa pisigivlugu. "
5161," And he is also the father of the circumcised, who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham possessed when he was still uncircumcised.","Tavra kisimiŋ piqaqtuat God-im pitquraŋiññik kiŋuvaannakkumaaqpata nunamik, ukpiġun anniqsuutauŋitchuq, unniqsuqłiiñ anniqsuutauŋiñmiuq. "
5162," For the promise to Abraham or to his descendants that he would inherit the world was not fulfilled through the law, but through the righteousness that comes by faith. ","Qanuq uqallautianiŋagivsi, God-im pitquraŋisa tatavsaqtitchuugaich iñuich qanuq kamagilaitkaich. Iñuich pitquraiññamiŋ kamagiŋisaksraitchut pitquranik."
5163," For if they become heirs by the law, faith is empty and the promise is nullified. ","Tavra iḷitchirugut iñuich ukpiġutiqaqtuksraupiaqtut aitchuusiaġiniaġumirruŋ God-im unniqsuqłiisaa. Aasii iñuich ukpiliqamiŋ, Abraham-mun kiŋuniḷiutisuurut, aasiiḷi God nagliktuutiqpaŋmigun nalupqinaiġuugaa unniqsuqłiisini iliŋiññun, tamatkunuŋa pitquramiñik piqaqtuanun, tamatkunuŋalu ukpiġutiqaqtuanun Abraham-tun. Tavraasii Abraham aapagigikput iluqata, "
5164," For the law brings wrath, because where there is no law there is no transgression either. ","aglausimaniŋatun Bible-ni, God uqallaŋaruq, “Uvaŋa aapaliutiŋagikpiñ iñugiaktuanun nunauruanun.” Tavraasii God-im akuqtuŋagaa Abraham aapaliutivlugu iluqaptiŋnun, qanuq ilaan ukpiġiŋagaa God iñuupkaiḷḷaruaq tuquŋaruanik, suli uqautiqallaruaq sivunniuġunmiñik taŋŋiŋaitchuanik taŋŋianiŋaruatun iḷivḷugich. "
5165," For this reason it is by faith so that it may be by grace, with the result that the promise may be certain to all the descendants – not only to those who are under the law, but also to those who have the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all ","Abraham, niġiunaiġaluaqtillugu timimiñi, niġiuŋaruq suli aapaġuġniaġnivḷuni iñugiaktuanun nunauruanun, uqallausiaqaŋavluni, “Iñugiaktuanik kiŋuniqaġniaqtutin.” "
5166," (as it is written, “I have made you the father of many nations”). He is our father in the presence of God whom he believed – the God who makes the dead alive and summons the things that do not yet exist as though they already do. ",Nalupqitchauraŋitchuq ukpiġunmiñi isummatigikami utuqqalivḷuni miqłiqsiñiksramigun tallimakipiatun ukiunikami. Nalupqitchauraŋiñmiuq isummatigikamiuŋ Sarah miqłiqsiḷaitchuaq. 
5167," Against hope Abraham believed in hope with the result that he became the father of many nations according to the pronouncement, “so will your descendants be.” ","Arguagiŋaitkaa God-mun taŋŋiġñiaqtilaaŋa unniqsuqłiisaa, aglaan nanġaqługu God ukpiliqsaiññaŋaruq. "
5168," Without being weak in faith, he considered his own body as dead (because he was about one hundred years old) and the deadness of Sarah’s womb. ",Abraham ukpipiallaŋaruq God-mun taŋŋiġumiñaqtilaaŋanik unniqsuqłiisaa. 
5169," He did not waver in unbelief about the promise of God but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God. ",Abraham ukpiġutaa pisigivlugu God-im nalaunŋasipkaŋagaa sivuqqamiñi. 
5170, He was fully convinced that what God promised he was also able to do. ,"Taapkua uqaluich Bible-niittuat quliaqtuaqaqtuat Abraham nalaunŋasipkaqtaunivḷugu ukpiġutaa pisigivlugu, anniqsuġmigaatigut uvagut. "
5171, So indeed it was credited to Abraham as righteousness.,"Qanuq ukpiġupta God-mun aŋipkaiŋaruamun Jesus-mik Ataniptiŋnik tuqqunmiñ, God-iptauq nalaunŋasipkaġniaġmigaatigut sivuqqamiñi. "
5172," But the statement it was credited to him was not written only for Abraham’s sake, ","God-im nalaunŋarualiyumiñaġaatigut, qanuq Jesus tuqqutiŋagaatigut aŋivḷuniḷu tuqqunmiñ, akiḷiqł̣ugich piḷuutivut nalaunŋasivḷutalu sivuġaani God-im."
5173," but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited, those who believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead. ",
5174, He was given over because of our transgressions and was raised for the sake of our justification.,
5175," Therefore, since we have been declared righteous by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, ",Paŋmapak aŋuyautaiqsugut God-mun qanuq ukpiqtugut Atanipta Jesus Christ nalaunŋasipkaŋagaatigut sivuġaani God. 
5176," through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of God’s glory. ","Pisigivlugu Jesus, God nagliktuutiqpaqaqsimaaqtuq uvaptiŋnun, aasii quviasuktugut niġiugivlugu iḷaŋiutiniksraqput God-im kamanautaanun. "
5177," Not only this, but we also rejoice in sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, ","Aasiisuli quviasugmiugut nagliksaaqaptaunnii, iḷisimavluta nagliksaaġunmun qiñuiqsaiññaqtitchumiñaqtilaaptiŋnik, "
5178," and endurance, character, and character, hope. ","aasii qiñuirrutiqaqtuiññaġupta nagliksaaqapta, iḷumun ititkikput ukpiqtuagutilaaqput. Niġiuktugut suli iḷaŋiutiniaqtilaaptiŋnik God-im kamanautaanik. "
5179," And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who was given to us.",Niġiukkurvut asiḷiqqutauŋitchuq. Ilitqusiġiksuam iḷuptiŋniittuam nalupqinaiŋagaa uvaptiŋnun iḷisimapkairuam uvaptiŋnik qanutun God-mun piviuttaġipiaġataqtilaaptiŋnik.
5180," For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. ","Uvaptiŋnik ikayuġumiñaipiaqtilluta, piviksraq nalautinman, Christ tuqqutiŋagai piḷuusiqiripayaurat. "
5181," (For rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person perhaps someone might possibly dare to die.) ",Qanutun iñuk nakuutigigaluaqtillugu nallivsaunnii tuqqutisuŋniaŋitkaa. Iḷaannivsauq iñuum imma tuqqutiyumiñaġugnaġmigaa iñulluataq. 
5182," But God demonstrates his own love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. ","Naaggauvva piḷuusiqiraugaluaqtilluta, Christ tuqqutiŋagaatigut, aasii taavrumuuna God-im salapqiġaa piviuttaqqutini uvaptiŋnun. "
5183," Much more then, because we have now been declared righteous by his blood, we will be saved through him from God’s wrath. ","Tavra nalaunŋasipkaqtaukapta paŋmapak Christ auŋagun, nalupqisuŋipiaqtugut Christ-mun annautiniaqtilaaptiŋnik God-im qinnautaaniñ. "
5184," For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, since we have been reconciled, will we be saved by his life? ","Christ iḷauraaliuŋagaatigut God-mun tuqqutivluta, uumikłiġaluaqtilluta ilaanik. Tavraasii paŋmapak God-im iḷauraaġiliutimmatigut, Christ nalupqinaitchuamik annautiniaġaatigut, qanuq ilaa iñuuruq. "
5185," Not only this, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received this reconciliation.","Taamnatualuuŋiñmiuq, quviakkiutigikput God Ataniptigun Jesus Christ-kun, iḷauraaliuqtuakun uvaptiŋnik God-mun."
5186," So then, just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all people because all sinned – ","Una pisigivlugu iñupayaat piḷuksiŋarut aasii tuquvlutiŋ. Adam iñuqqaaq piḷuksiŋaruq aasii aquvatigun tuquŋaruq. Adam kiŋuniġivlugich iñupayaat, iluqaġmiŋ piḷuksiŋarut aasii tuquruksraġuqłutiŋ. "
5187," for before the law was given, sin was in the world, but there is no accounting for sin when there is no law. ","Iñupayaat iñuuŋaruat Moses aitchuusiaqaŋaiñŋaan God-miñ pitquranik piḷuusiqirauŋarut, aglaan pasirauŋaitchut piḷuunmikkun qanuq piqaŋił̣ł̣utiŋ God-im pitquraŋiñik. "
5188, Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type of the coming one) transgressed. ,"Tavra iñupayaat Adam-miñqaŋa Moses-munaglaan tuquŋarut Adam tuvraqługu kipuqłaktaŋitkaluaŋŋaisa God-im pitquraŋi. Tuqummiut qanuq piḷuusiqirauvlutiktauq. Adam tuqqunmik pipkaimman, Christ-li aquvatigun qairuaq iñuggutiqaqtitchiruq. "
5189," But the gracious gift is not like the transgression. For if the many died through the transgression of the one man, how much more did the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ multiply to the many! ","God-im nagliktuutigivlugu aitchuutaa akiḷḷiuruq Adam kamaksriŋiññiŋanun. Iñuich tuquŋarut qanuq Adam piḷuksiŋaruq. Taavrumaŋŋa pił̣haaqtuq, iñuich nalaunŋasipkaqtauyumiñaqtut akiiḷaamik Jesus Christ-kun, qanuq God nagliktuutiqpaqaŋaruq iliŋiññun. "
5190," And the gift is not like the one who sinned. For judgment, resulting from the one transgression, led to condemnation, but the gracious gift from the many failures led to justification. ","Tavra akiiḷaaq aitchuun Christ-kuaqtuaq akiḷḷiuruq Adam piḷuutikun iñiqtaŋanun. Qanuq Adam piḷuutaa pipkaiŋaruq isivġiunmik suksraunġiunmiglu, aglaan akiiḷaaq aitchuun, iñugiaktuat piḷuksianiŋmata, nalaunŋasipkairuq iñuŋnik God-im sivuġaani. "
5191," For if, by the transgression of the one man, death reigned through the one, how much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one, Jesus Christ!","Pisigivlugu Adam piḷuksimman, tuqqun umialiktun atanniqsimanniŋaruq iñupayaanik. Taavrumaŋŋa pił̣haaqtuq, iñuich akuqtuiruat nalaunŋasipkaunmik God-im nagliktuutigivlugu aitchuutaanik, iñuullaniaqtut umialiktun, atanniqsimalugu piḷuun ikayuutaagun Jesus Christ."
5192," Consequently, just as condemnation for all people came through one transgression, so too through the one righteous act came righteousness leading to life for all people. ","Tavra iñuum atautchim piḷuksisaata qaġġisimmagu suksraunġiun iñupayaanun, tainnalivsauq iñuum atautchim kamaksriñiŋata God-mik, qaġġisigaik suliqutigiŋaiqsauniġlu piiguġumiñaqsivḷugich piḷuutit iñuggullu iñupayaanun. "
5193," For just as through the disobedience of the one man many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of one man many will be made righteous. ","Qanuq iñuum atautchim kamasuŋirrutaagun iñuich piḷuusiqiriġuġmata, tainnaptauq iñuum atautchim kamaksriñiŋagun, iñuich nalaunŋasipkaqtauyumiñaqtut. "
5194," Now the law came in so that the transgression may increase, but where sin increased, grace multiplied all the more, ","God-im aitchuutigimmagich pitqurani Moses-kun, iñuich iḷitchuġivsaaŋarut piḷuun kamaksriŋirrutautilaaŋanik God-im pitquraŋiñik. Tavra kamasuŋirrun aglimman, tainnatuttauq God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋa aglił̣haaŋaruq. "
5195," so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace will reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.","Tavra piḷuun atanniqsimanniŋman iñuŋnik tuqqutauvluni, God-ivli nagliktuutiqpaŋa atanniqsimanniktuq iñuŋnik iñuupkallavlugich isuitchuamun qanuq Atanipta Jesus Christ nalaunŋasipkaŋagai."
5196, What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? ,"Taamna tainnainman, piḷuusiqiugaqtuksrauŋitchugut uuktuġniaqsiññaġlugu qanutun God nagliktuutiqpaqaqtilaaŋa. "
5197, Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? ,"Piḷuusiqiruksrauŋipiaġataqtugut. Ukpiliqapta Christ Jesus-mun, iñuutchivut piḷuksisuguuruat tuqummatun piut. Taamna pisigilugu piḷuusiqiugaqtuksrauŋitchugut. "
5198, Or do you not know that as many as were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? ,"Iḷisimarusi iluqata paptaiqsaukapta, Atausiŋŋuqatauŋarugut Christ Jesus-mun. Aasii ilaa tuqumman, uvagut piḷuksisuguuruat iñuutchivut tuqummiut. "
5199," Therefore we have been buried with him through baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too may live a new life.","Tavra paptaiqsaukapta, piḷuktuat iñuutchivut iḷuviqataummatun piŋarut ilaa tuqumman.

5200," For if we have become united with him in the likeness of his death, we will certainly also be united in the likeness of his resurrection. ","Tavra atausiŋŋuqatigiŋaguptigu tuqqutaani, nalupqinaitchuq atausiŋŋuqatiginiaġmigikput aŋŋisaani. "
5201," We know that our old man was crucified with him so that the body of sin would no longer dominate us, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. ","Iḷisimarugut ilaa kikiaktuurraumman uvagut piḷuksisuguuruat iñuutchivut kikiaktuurrauqatauŋarut ilaanun, piḷuunmun aŋalanŋaiquvluta, kivgauŋaiquvluta piḷuunmun. "
5202, (For someone who has died has been freed from sin.),"Iñuk tuqukami, aŋalatinŋaiġuuruq piḷuunmun. "
5203," Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. ","Piqatauŋaniqapta Christ tuqqutaani, ukpiqtugut piqatauniaqtilaaptiŋnik iñuusianun Christ. "
5204," We know that since Christ has been raised from the dead, he is never going to die again; death no longer has mastery over him. ","Qanuq iḷisimarugut Christ aŋipkaqtauganikami tuqqunmiñ, tuqutqikkumiñaipiaqtuq, tuqqutim atanniqsimatqikkumiñaitkaa. "
5205," For the death he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life he lives, he lives to God. ","Christ tuqukami, tuquŋaruq atausiaqłuni, akiḷiġukługich piḷuutivut. Paŋmapak iñuuruq, iñuutuiññaqłuni God-mun. "
5206," So you too consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus.","Ilivsiḷiasii isummatigiruksraurusi ilivsiññik tuquŋaruatun iḷiḷusi piḷuunmun, aŋalatinŋaiġḷusi piḷuunmun, aasii iñuulusi God-mun, qanuq atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagiksi Christ Jesus."
5207," Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you obey its desires, ",Piḷuunmun aŋalatinnasi. Kamaginagich pigiitchuat pisuguutisi. 
5208," and do not present your members to sin as instruments to be used for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who are alive from the dead and your members to God as instruments to be used for righteousness. ","Atuġnagu sulliñipayauraŋa timivsi piḷuusiqutigisuglugu. Aglaan God-im aŋalallisi qanuq tavraŋŋaaglaan aŋalatinŋaiŋarusi piḷuunmun iñuusarraqsikavsi God-mun. Aŋalatitchiuŋ sulliñipayauraŋa timivsi God-mun, nalaunŋarualiqiyumausi. "
5209," For sin will have no mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.","Piḷuutim aŋalataġiŋaiġñiaġaasi, qanuq iñuuŋaiŋarusi kamaginiataglugich pitqurat, aglaan iñuurusi God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun."
5210, What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? Absolutely not! ,"Taamna tainnainniġman, piḷuksiñata pisigilugu iñuuniqput God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun, kamaksriñiatagniġmiñ pitquranik qaisauruanik Moses-kun. Piḷuksiruksrauŋipiaġataqtugut. "
5211," Do you not know that if you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey, either of sin resulting in death, or obedience resulting in righteousness? ","Iḷisimarusi nalliqsi kivgaliutiniġumi kimulliqaa, kamagiraksraġigaa kivgatun.

5212," But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to, ","Tavra God quyyavigirauli, qanuq paŋmapak kamaksripialiqsusi uummativsiññiñ taavrumiŋa iḷisaurrutaanik God-im iḷisausiavsiññik, kivgausuuŋagaluaqtuasii piḷuunmun.

5213," and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness. ","Annaktitauganikłusi piḷuunmiñ, kivgaġuqtusi iłuatun iñuuniaġniġmun sivuġaani God-im. "
5214," (I am speaking in human terms because of the weakness of your flesh.) For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification. ","Uqautisaaqsigivsi uuktuusiġḷuŋa kivgauniġmik, kaŋiqsimmaġiksitquvlusi.

5216, So what benefit did you then reap from those things that you are now ashamed of? For the end of those things is death. ,Tainnatchim iñuutchim paŋmapak kanŋugilikkavsi anniqsuŋaitkaasi aglaan tatavsaqtaupkaġumiñaġaasi isuitchuamun. 
5217," But now, freed from sin and enslaved to God, you have your benefit leading to sanctification, and the end is eternal life. ","Paŋmapak-aasii atanġiqsitaurusi piḷuunmiñ kivgaliutivlusi God-mun, anniqsuusiaqaġniaqtusi ilaaguaqtauniġmik iñuggunmiglu isuitchuamik iñuutqulusi God-mun. "
5218," For the payoff of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.","Kiñaliqaa piḷuusiqirauruaq akiḷiusiaqaġniaqtuq tatavsaqtauluni isuitchuamun, aglaan God-im akiiḷaaq aitchuutigigaa iñuggun isuitchuaq tamatkunuŋa atausiŋŋuqatauruanun Christ Jesus-mun."
5219," Or do you not know, brothers and sisters (for I am speaking to those who know the law), that the law is lord over a person as long as he lives? ","Aniqatiit, uqautigivsi iḷisimaruasii God-im pitquraŋiñik qaisaŋiñik Moses-kun, iḷisimarusi pitquranun iñuk aŋalatitchuuruq iñuuniġmiñi kisianik. "
5220," For a married woman is bound by law to her husband as long as he lives, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of the marriage. ","Uvva urriqatiksraŋa taavruma. Pitqurat uqaluqaqtut aġnamun iñuuqatigitquvlugu uiŋa iñuuniqtutilaaŋatun. Aglaan uiŋa tuqukpan, pitquram tuvaaqatigiiksitaŋakta aŋalataġiŋaiġaa. "
5221," So then, if she is joined to another man while her husband is alive, she will be called an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she is joined to another man, she is not an adulteress. ","Tavra piqatiqaġumi allamik aŋunmik uiñi iñuuŋŋaan, allatuqtauniaqtuq. Aglaan uiŋa tuqukpan, taavruma pitquram tuvaaqatigiiksitaŋakta aŋalataġiŋaiġaa. Uiñikkumi allamik aŋunmik allatuqtauniaŋitchuq. "
5222," So, my brothers and sisters, you also died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you could be joined to another, to the one who was raised from the dead, to bear fruit to God. ","Tainnatuttauq ilivsiññun inmiuq, aniqatiit. Christ tuqumman, tuquqatigiruatun piŋagiksi, aasii paŋmapak aglausimaruat pitqurat aŋalanŋaiġaasi.

5223," For when we were in the flesh, the sinful desires, aroused by the law, were active in the members of our body to bear fruit for death. ","Iñuusuuŋŋapta kamagivlugu piḷuun, piḷuksisuguuŋarugut, aasii God-im pitquraŋisa iḷitchuġipkaqłuta piḷuusiqitilaaptiŋnik. Taavrumaasii pigiitchuam tatavsaqtaupkaġayaġaatigut isuitchuamun. "
5224," But now we have been released from the law, because we have died to what controlled us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit and not under the old written code. ","Aglaan paŋmapak pitqurat aŋalanŋaiŋagaatigut.

5225," What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Absolutely not! Certainly, I would not have known sin except through the law. For indeed I would not have known what it means to desire something belonging to someone else if the law had not said, “Do not covet.” ","Uqallakkumiñaqpisa pitquranun piḷuksipkaġuuniḷuta? Tainna uqallaktuksrauŋipiaqtugut. Pitqurat anniqsuġaatigut iḷitchuġipkaqłuta piḷuutim suutilaaŋanik. Nalunayaqtuŋa kaviuġniq piḷuutautilaaŋanik pitqurat uqallaŋaitpata, “Kaviuġnaq.” "
5226," But sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of wrong desires. For apart from the law, sin is dead. ","Iḷitchuġikama pitqurani kaviuġniġmik, piḷuutim kipiġniuqtitkaqsigaaŋa qanusipayaanun pigiitchuanun. Iñuum nalugumigich God-im pitquraŋi, nalummiuq suutilaaŋanik piḷuun. "
5227," And I was once alive apart from the law, but with the coming of the commandment sin became alive ",Qaŋauvlugu iñuunnamni naluŋagaluaqtuŋa God-im pitquraŋiñik. Taimani piḷuutaiñmatun inŋagaluaqtuq uvamnun. Aasii iḷitchuġikapkich pitqurat iḷitchuġimmiuŋa piḷuksiŋatilaamnik. Tavra tatavsaaksraġuŋaruŋa isuitchuamun. 
5228, and I died. So I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life brought death! ,"Taapkua pitqurat iñuuliññiktuksraġaluat uvamnik, iḷitchuġipkaqsiññaŋagaanŋa pasirautilaamnik tatavsaqtauyumiñaqsivḷuŋa isuitchuamun. "
5229," For sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it I died. ","Qanuq iḷitchuġiŋaruŋa piḷuksiŋatilaamnik iḷitchuġipqauraqapkich God-im pitquraŋi.

5230," So then, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good.",Tavra God-im pitquraŋi qaisaŋi Moses-kun piḷuutaitchut nalaunŋarullu nakuurullu. 
5231," Did that which is good, then, become death to me? Absolutely not! But sin, so that it would be shown to be sin, produced death in me through what is good, so that through the commandment sin would become utterly sinful. ","God-im pitquraŋisa nakuuruat pasiraksraġuŋavanŋa tatavsaqtauruksraġuqłuŋa isuitchuamun? Naaggapiaġataq. Uvaŋa piḷuunma pasiraupkaŋagaanŋa. Iḷitchuġipqauraqama God-im nakuuruanik pitquraŋiñik, iḷitchuġimmiuŋa qanutun piḷuusiqiriqpaurautilaamnik."
5232," For we know that the law is spiritual – but I am unspiritual, sold into slavery to sin. ","Pitqurat nakuurut. Pasiraksrauŋitchut pitqurat, aglaan uvaŋa kamagilaiññiġitka piḷukpaił̣ł̣uŋa. "
5233," For I don’t understand what I am doing. For I do not do what I want – instead, I do what I hate. ","Kaŋiqsiḷguitchuŋaunnii uvamnik, qanuq uvva pisukkaluaġaqtuŋa sumik nalaunŋaruamik, piḷaitchuŋa. Pianigaġigiga pisuŋitkaluakkaġa naġġugikkaġalu. "
5234," But if I do what I don’t want, I agree that the law is good. ","Tavraasii pisuuniqama pitqurat pitquŋisaŋiññik, uvaŋalu piyumaŋitkaluakkamnik, piiḷaaġiŋitkiga pitqurat nakuutilaaŋat. "
5235," But now it is no longer me doing it, but sin that lives in me. ",Nutauruam iñuutchima pipkaqtaŋitkai sut naġġugikkatka. Aglaan piḷuksisuguuruam iñuutchima pipkaqtaġaaŋa naġġugikkamnik. 
5236," For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I want to do the good, but I cannot do it. ",Iḷisimaruŋa piḷuksisuguuruaq iñuusiġikkaġa nakuuŋipiaqtuq. Nakuurualiqisugluqtuŋaunnii suaŋŋataitchuŋa nakuurualiqiyumiñaġluŋa. 
5237," For I do not do the good I want, but I do the very evil I do not want! ","Qanuq piḷaitkiga nakuurualiqiaġiyumakkaġa, aglaan pivḷugu pigiitchuaq pisuŋitkaluakkaġa. "
5238," Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer me doing it but sin that lives in me.","Tavra pisuuniġupku pisuŋitkaluakkaġa, nutauruam iñuutchima pipkaqtaŋitkaa, aglaan piḷuksisuguuruam iñuutchima."
5239," So, I find the law that when I want to do good, evil is present with me. ","Tainnasuŋaiññaq pisuuruq, nakuurualiqisukkaluaqama piḷaitkiga, aglaan pigiitchualiqiruŋa. "
5240, For I delight in the law of God in my inner being. ,"Nutauruami iñuutchimñi, nakuaġigaluaġitka God-im pitquraŋi, "
5241, But I see a different law in my members waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members. ,"aglaan iḷisimaruŋa uvamni ittuq alla suaŋŋan aŋuyaktuaq pitchaiḷiraġnikłuni uvamnik nakuurualiqitchaiḷivḷuŋa, kivgaupkaqłuŋa piḷuutimnun. "
5242, Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? ,Qanutun uvaŋa quviasuŋisigivik? Kia atanġiqsinniaqpaŋa piḷuksisuguuruamiñ iñuutchimñiñ? 
5243," Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.","Quyyavigigiga God atanġiqsinmaŋa Jesus Christ-kun Ataniptigun. Tavraasii nutauruami iñuutchimñi kamagisukkitka God-im pitquraŋi, aglaan piḷuksisuguuruam iñuutchima piḷuksipkaġuugaaŋa."
5244, There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. ,Tavra paŋmapak suksraunġiqsauyumiñaitchut tamatkua atausiŋŋuqatauruat Christ Jesus-mun. 
5245, For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death. ,"Qanuq atausiŋŋuqatigikaptigu Christ, Ilitqusiġiksuam aitchuŋagaatigut nutauruamik iñuutchimik, atanġiqsiłłuta piḷuunmiñ tatavsaunmiḷḷu isuitchuamun. "
5246," For God achieved what the law could not do because it was weakened through the flesh. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and concerning sin, he condemned sin in the flesh, ","God-im piŋagaa pitqurat qaisauruat Moses-kun piyumiñaisaŋat. Pitqurat iñuk suuramikunnii nalaunŋasiyumiñaiñŋagaat, qanuq piḷuusiqirauvluni kamagilaitkai pitqurat. Aglaan God-im tiliŋagaa Iġñini timiqaġlugu iñuutquvlugu uvaptiktun, piḷuksiŋaitchuq aglaan. God-im Iġñiŋan akiḷiŋagai piḷuutivut, aasii taamna pikamiuŋ, suaŋŋataiŋagaa piḷuun aŋalatchiyumiñaiqł̣ugu uvaptiŋnik. "
5247," so that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.","Tavraasii paŋmapak kamagiyumiñaġivut God-im pitquraŋi, sivisutilaaŋatun Ilitqusiġiksuamun aŋalatinnipta, aŋalatinŋaiġḷuta piḷuksisuguuruanun iñuutchivsiŋnun. "
5248," For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit. ","Iñuich aŋalatittuat piḷuksisuguuruanun iñuutchimiŋnun, iñuusuurut iviġagniaqsiññaqłutiŋ inmiŋnun, aglaalli iñuich aŋalatittuat Ilitqusiġiksuamun, iñuusuurut iviġagniaqługu Ilitqusiġiksuaq. "
5249," For the outlook of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace, ","Iñuich iñuusiqaqtuiññaqamiŋ kamagivlugich piḷuktuat kipiġniuġutitiŋ, tuquruksraurut. Aglaan iñuich kamaksriugaqtuat qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam pitqutiŋiñik, piqaqtut iñuggunmik tutqiunmiglu. "
5250," because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so. ","Iñuk kamaksriugaqtuaq qanuq piḷuksisuguuruam iñuutchimi kipiġniuġutiŋiñik, uumikłiqsuq God-mik. Taavruma iñuum kamagiŋitkai God-im pitquraŋi. Kamagiyumiñaipiaġai. "
5251, Those who are in the flesh cannot please God. ,Kialiqaa tainna iñuusiqaqtuam God iviġakkumiñaitkaa.
5252," You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God lives in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, this person does not belong to him. ","Aglaan ilivsi aŋalatinŋitchusi piḷuksisuguuruanun iñuutchivsiññun. Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa God-im iñuupiaqpan iḷuvsiññi, aŋalataġigaasi Ilitqusiġiksuam. Kiñaliqaa piqaŋitchuaq Ilitqusiġiksuaŋanik Christ, Christ-gum pigiŋitkaa. "
5253," But if Christ is in you, your body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is your life because of righteousness. ","Tavra Christ iḷuvsiññiitpan, ilitqutchisi iñuuniaqtut qanuq nalaunŋasipkaqtauŋarusi, timisi tuqugaluaqpataunnii pisigilugu piḷuun. "
5254," Moreover if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you, the one who raised Christ from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive through his Spirit who lives in you. ","Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa God-im iñuukpan iḷuvsiññi, aŋipkaiŋaruaq Jesus-mik tuqqunmiñ, taavruma aŋipkairuam Christ Jesus-mik tuqqunmiñ, iñuggusiġñiaġmigai tuqullaruat timisi, taavrumuuna suli Ilitqusiġiksuamigun iñuuruakun iḷuvsiññi."
5255," So then, brothers and sisters, we are under obligation, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh ","Tavra aniqatiit, iñuuruksrauŋipiaqtugut kamagilugich piḷuksisuguuruat iñuutchivut. "
5256," (for if you live according to the flesh, you will die), but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body you will live. ","Iñuuguvsi kamagilugich piḷuksisuguuruat iñuutchisi, tatavsaqtauniaqtusi isuitchuamun. Aglaan Ilitqusiġiksuakun nutqaqtitkuvsigik pigiitchuat piḷġutchisi, iñuuniaqtusi isuitchuamun. "
5257, For all who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. ,Qanuq iluqaġmiŋ iñuich aŋalatittuat Ilitqusiġiksuamun miqłiqtuurut God-mun. 
5258," For you did not receive the spirit of slavery leading again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, “Abba, Father.” ","Ilitqusiġiksuam aitchuusiavsi iḷisimapkaġaasi tiguaqtauvlusi miqłiqtuġitilaavsiññik God-mun, sivuuqqataiqł̣usiḷu tatavsausiaksramun isuitchuamik. Tavraasii tuqłuġumiñaġikput God Aapaaġlugu. "
5259, The Spirit himself bears witness to our spirit that we are God’s children. ,"Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuam iḷitchuġipkaġaatigut nalupqinaiqł̣ugu miqłiqtuġitilaaptiŋnik God-mun, "
5260," And if children, then heirs (namely, heirs of God and also fellow heirs with Christ) – if indeed we suffer with him so we may also be glorified with him. ","aasii God-im miqłiqtuġiniġmatigut, kiŋuvaannaktaġiniġaatigut. Kiŋuvaannaktaginiġmatigut, kiŋuvaannaqatauyumiñaqsirugut Christ-mun, aasii iḷaŋiutiniaqtugut kamanaunmun piqatigilugu Christ, nagliksaaqtuagugupta ilaa pisigilugu."
5261, For I consider that our present sufferings cannot even be compared to the glory that will be revealed to us. ,Isumalaaġutigikapkich paŋmapak nagliksaaġutivut suuŋitchut nalliġaaġutausaġumiŋ iñuusiḷḷuatamun piginiakkaptiŋnun qiḷaŋmi. 
5262, For the creation eagerly waits for the revelation of the sons of God. ,Sut savaaŋi God-im utaqqirut niġiupiaġataqłutiŋ piviksramun God-im salapqiqpagich miqłiqtuni. 
5263, For the creation was subjected to futility – not willingly but because of God who subjected it – in hope ,Qanuq tamatkua sut God-im savaaŋi igliŋitchut ilaan sivunniutiqqaaŋagun. Aasii iliŋich pasiraksrauŋiñmiut tainnainniŋatigun. God-im tainnaiḷipkaŋagai Adam piḷuksimman. 
5264, that the creation itself will also be set free from the bondage of decay into the glorious freedom of God’s children. ,"Tavra tamatkua God-im savaaŋi atanġiqsitauniaġmiut aŋalatchisaaniñ tuqqutim aggutivlu, piqatauyumiñaqsiḷugich quvianaqtuamun atanġiqsirrunmun piqatigilugich miqłiqtuŋi God-im. "
5265, For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers together until now. ,Iḷisimagivut supayaat God-im savaaŋi nagliksaaqatigiiksut atqunaq aġnatun aulayyautikkaŋatun. 
5266," Not only this, but we ourselves also, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption, the redemption of our bodies. ","Kisimiŋ sut savaaguruat nagliksaaqpaŋitchut aglaan uvagullu. Piqaġaluaŋŋapta Ilitqusiġiksuamik iḷitchuġipkaiḷḷaruamik quviasugniksraptiŋnik qiḷaŋmi, nagliksaaqpaŋmiugut utaqqivḷugu God-mun miqłiqtuliutiniksraqput qiḷaŋmi, timivut aŋipkaqtaukpata. "
5267," For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope, because who hopes for what he sees? ",Taamna niġiugisaŋagikput annaurrauganikapta. Niġiuguurugut sunik taŋŋiŋaitchuanik. Iñuk niġiuyuitchuq sumik taŋŋianiŋaruamik. 
5268," But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly wait for it with endurance. ","Tavra niġiuktugut suli quviasuusiaksrautiptiŋnik taŋŋianiŋaitchuamik, aasii qiñuiqł̣uta taŋŋiqsiaġigikput."
5269," In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know how we should pray, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings. ",Tainnatun Ilitqusiġiksuam ikayuġaatigut suaŋaiḷiraġikapta. Qanuq iḷisimaŋitchugut aŋaiyyuniġmik aŋaiyyusiksraptiktun. Ilitqusiġiksuam qiññuaqtuutigaatigut iiqtuaġutiqaqłuni uqautigianignaitchuanik uqalugilugich. 
5270," And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes on behalf of the saints according to God’s will. ","Suli God, iḷisimaruaq uummatiŋiññik iñuich, iḷisimaruq qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam uqaqtilaaŋanik qiññuaqtuutimmigaich ilaaguaqtauruat God-mun, tuvraqługu pisuutaa God-im."
5271," And we know that all things work together for good for those who love God, who are called according to his purpose, ","Iḷisimarugut supayaat piruat uvaptiŋnun savaqatigiiksilaaŋannik anniqsuqsaqługich tamatkua piviuttaqsriruat God-mik, ququaqtauruat tuvraqługu God-im sivunniutaa. "
5272," because those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters. ","Qanuq ilaan iḷisimaŋagai iñuŋni aullaqisaamiñqaŋa, suli taimani sivunniŋaruq Iġñiġmisun iḷiñiaġnivḷugich, ilaan Iġñini qaukłiḷiutitquvlugu akunġanni iñugiaktuat aniqatigiich. "
5273," And those he predestined, he also called; and those he called, he also justified; and those he justified, he also glorified.","Tavra tamatkua sivunniŋakkani taimani Iġñiġmisun iḷiñiaġnivḷugich, ilaan ququaŋagai, aasii tamatkua ququakkani ilaan nalaunŋasiŋagai, aasii nalaunŋasipkaqtauruat, ilaan suli kamanaqsipkaqługich."
5274," What then shall we say about these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? ","Tamatkua tainnainniġmata, uqallautiksraqaqtugut inna. God-im iḷaalliqsimammatigut, akiḷḷiitchugut sivuuġagiraksraptiŋnik. "
5275," Indeed, he who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all – how will he not also, along with him, freely give us all things? ","God-im aitchuutigiyumaŋagaa ilaan nanmiñiq Iġñini tuqqutitquvluta.

5276, Who will bring any charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. ,"Aasiisuli iñuitchuq uqallakkumiñaqtuamik God-im iñuksraqtaaġikkaŋatigut pasiraksrauniḷuta, qanuq ilaan nalaunŋasiŋagaatigut. "
5277," Who is the one who will condemn? Christ is the one who died (and more than that, he was raised), who is at the right hand of God, and who also is interceding for us. ","Kialiqaa suli suksraunġiqsaupkaġumiñaitkaatigut, qanuq Christ Jesus tuqqutiŋagaatigut, aasiisuli aŋipkaqtauŋaruq tuqqunmiñ, aasii ittuq God-im taliqpiata tuŋaani qiññuaqtuutivluta. "
5278," Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will trouble, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? ","Sumik piitchuq piyumiñaqtuamik uvaptiŋnun piiqsitchumiñaġluta Christ piviuttaqqutaaniñ.

"
5279," As it is written, “For your sake we encounter death all day long; we were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.” ","Tamatkua nalautitchuurut iñuutchivsiŋni aglausimaruatun Bible-ni inna,"
5280," No, in all these things we have complete victory through him who loved us! ",
5281," For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor heavenly rulers, nor things that are present, nor things to come, nor powers, ",
5282," nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.",
5283," I am telling the truth in Christ (I am not lying!), for my conscience assures me in the Holy Spirit – ","Atausiŋŋuqatauŋavluŋa Christ-mun sagluŋitchuŋa, aglaan uqaqtuŋa iḷumun ittuamik. Ilitqusiġiksuavlu nalupqisuktinŋitkaaŋa iḷumun uqaqtilaamnik inna. "
5284, I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart. ,"Isumaaġutiqpaqaqtuŋa suli ataramik ipiqtusuutiqaqłuŋa iḷumni pisigivlugich Jew-guqatitka, nanmiñitka. "
5285," For I could wish that I myself were accursed – cut off from Christ – for the sake of my people, my fellow countrymen, ","Qanuq piñaġumiñaqpan, qanuġlugich annaurrauyumiñaqpata Jew-guqatitka uvaŋa tammaġnipkun piiqsauluŋa Christ-miñ, tainna pitqurriñayaqtuŋa. "
5286," who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption as sons, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the temple worship, and the promises. ","Iliŋich kiŋuniġigai Israel-gum, suli God-im ququaŋakkaŋi miqłiqtuġisukługich. Tautuŋarut qaumanġanik nayuqłiataata God-im.

5288," It is not as though the word of God had failed. For not all those who are descended from Israel are truly Israel, ","God-im uqaluŋi anniqsuutauŋaiŋaitchut pisigigiññaġlugu iḷaŋich Israel-guruat ukpiŋiññiḷugich. Qanuq Israel kiŋuniŋisa iḷaŋich Israel-gupiaġataŋitchut, "
5289, nor are all the children Abraham’s true descendants; rather “through Isaac will your descendants be counted.” ,"tamatkiġḷugich Abraham kiŋuniŋi miqłiqtuliqsuutinaġumiñaitchut ilaanun, qanuq Bible-ni uqallaun ittuq, “Iġñipkun Isaac-kuaqtuat kisimik taiñaġniaqtut miqłiqtuġnik.” "
5290," This means it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God; rather, the children of promise are counted as descendants. ","Taamna sivuniqaqtuq tamatkiġḷugich Abraham kiŋuniŋi miqłiqtuġiŋitkai God-im, aglaan kisiisa miqłiqtut aniruat Isaac-kun, tuvraqługu God-im unniqsuqłiisaa Abraham-mun. "
5291, For this is what the promise declared: “About a year from now I will return and Sarah will have a son.” ,"Qanuq inna God uqallaŋaruq unniqsuqłiiñmiñi, “Ukiutqigu tainnaiḷikpan, qaiñiaqtuŋa aasii Sarah iġñiqaġniaqtuq.”"
5292," Not only that, but when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our ancestor Isaac – ","Aasiisuli, Isaac maŋŋuqput aŋutiġuġman tuvaaqatinikłuni Rebecca-mik, Rebecca unniqsuqłiisiaqaŋammiuq malġiagni aniŋaiñŋaaŋnik. "
5293," even before they were born or had done anything good or bad (so that God’s purpose in election would stand, not by works but by his calling) – ","Aniŋaiñŋaġmik nakuurualiqisaŋaitkaluaqtuk naagga pigiitchualiqilutiŋ.

5294," it was said to her, “The older will serve the younger,” ","Tavra Rebecca uqallausiaqaŋaruq, “Aŋayukłium savautiniaġaa nukaqłiq.” "
5295," just as it is written: “Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.”","Aglausimammiuq Bible-ni God uqallaŋnivḷugu inna, “Jacob piviuttaġiŋagiga, aglaan Esau pisuŋiñŋagiga.”"
5296, What shall we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not! ,"Tainna God piŋaniġman, uqallakkumiñaqpisa God nalaunŋiññiḷugu? Naaggapiaġataq. "
5297," For he says to Moses: “I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion.” ","Qanuq ilaa uqallaŋaruq Moses-mun, “Nagliktuutiqaġniaqtuŋa kimun pisukkuma, tuvraġlugu uvaŋa pisuutiga.” "
5298," So then, it does not depend on human desire or exertion, but on God who shows mercy. ","Tavra God iñuksraġuuruq pisigisuŋaġnagu piksraqtaagusugniŋat, naaggaunnii pisigisuŋaġnagu piḷḷuataġniŋat, aglaan pisigivlugu ilaan nagliktuutini. "
5299," For the scripture says to Pharaoh: “For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I may demonstrate my power in you, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.” ","Urriqativsaaq Bible-ni ittuq God-im uqalua Pharaoh-mun, “Uvaŋa umialliutiŋagikpiñ Egypt-mun salapqiġukługu suaŋŋatiga ilipkun, nunam iñuŋi iḷitchuġitquvlugich iḷumun God-autilaamnik.” "
5300," So then, God has mercy on whom he chooses to have mercy, and he hardens whom he chooses to harden.","Tavraasii God naglikkutiqallaruq kimupayaaq pisukami, suli uqaqsiġiiḷipkallavlugu kiñapayaaq pisukami."

","Tavra tainnatun God-im piyumiñaġai iñuich qanuq pisukkumigich.

5307, As he also says in Hosea:,"Taamna iḷumun ittuq aglausimaruatun Hosea-mi, God-im uqallautaa inna,"
5308,"“I will call those who were not my people, ‘My people,’ and I will call her who was unloved, ‘My beloved.’”","Sumik tamatkua iluqaġmiŋ sivuniqaqpat? Sivuniqaqtut Jew-guŋitchuat nalaunŋasiñiataŋitchuat God-im pitquraŋigun, nalaunŋasipkaqtauŋarut pisigivlugu ukpiġutaat. "

5312, for the Lord will execute his sentence on the earth completely and quickly.” ,
5313," Just as Isaiah predicted, ",
5314,"“If the Lord of armies had not left us descendants, ",
5315,"we would have become like Sodom, ",
5316,and we would have resembled Gomorrah.”,
5317," What shall we say then? – that the Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness obtained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith, ",
5318, but Israel even though pursuing a law of righteousness did not attain it. ,
5319," Why not? Because they pursued it not by faith but (as if it were possible) by works. They stumbled over the stumbling stone, ",
5320," just as it is written, ",
5321,"“Look, I am laying in Zion a stone that will cause people to stumble",
5322,"and a rock that will make them fall, ",
5323,yet the one who believes in him will not be put to shame.”,
5324," Brothers and sisters, my heart’s desire and prayer to God on behalf of my fellow Israelites is for their salvation. ","Aniqatiit, uummatimniñ kipiġniupiaġataqtuŋa aŋaiyyuruŋalu God-mun, aŋaiyyutivlugich Jew-guruat aniqatiitka annaurrautquvlugich. "
5325," For I can testify that they are zealous for God, but their zeal is not in line with the truth. ","Iḷisimaruŋa kipiġniuqłutiŋ savautigaat God, aglaan tuvraŋitkaat God-im uqautaa inmiŋnun. "
5326," For ignoring the righteousness that comes from God, and seeking instead to establish their own righteousness, they did not submit to God’s righteousness. ","Qanuq naluvlutiŋ God-mun iñuich nalaunŋasipkaġuutilaaŋat ukpiġutaatigun, inmiŋnik nalaunŋasiñiataŋarut sivuġaani God-im. Tavraasii nalaunŋasipkaqtinŋaitchut God-mun. "
5327," For Christ is the end of the law, with the result that there is righteousness for everyone who believes.",Iñupayaaq ukpiqtuaq Christ-mun nalaunŋasiñiataŋaiŋaruq inmiñik kamaksriñiġmigun God-im pitquraŋiñik aitchuutauŋaruanik Moses-kun. Nalaunŋasipkaqtauŋaruq ukpiqami Christ-mun.
5328, For Moses writes about the righteousness that is by the law: “The one who does these things will live by them.” ,"Moses aglaŋaruq, iñugguuq nalaunŋasipkaqtauniaġumi pitquratigun, ilaan kamagipiallagaksraġigai ataramik iluqaqpiuraŋisa God-im pitquraŋi. "
5329," But the righteousness that is by faith says: “Do not say in your heart, ‘Who will ascend into heaven?’” (that is, to bring Christ down) ","Aglaalli nalaunŋasiñikun uqallaun ukpiġutikuaqtuaq inna ittuq. Isumaruksrauŋitchutin mayuqtuksraunasugalutin qiḷaŋmun atqautiyaqtuġlugu Christ qiḷaŋmiñ, "
5330," or “Who will descend into the abyss?” (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead). ",atqaqtuksrauniḷutillu tuquŋaruat inaannun aŋipkaġiaġlugu Christ tuqqunmiñ. 
5331," But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith that we preach), ","Uqaluk nalaunŋasiñikun ukpiġutikuaqtuaq alġaqsruutigigikput. Taamna uqaluk kaŋiqsiñaqtuq, iḷisimalluataġiksi, uvva inna ittuq, "
5332," because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. ","quliaqtuaġiguvsiuŋ allanun Jesus Atanġuniḷugu, suli ukpiġilugu uummativsiññiñ God-mun aŋipkaŋaniḷugu tuqqunmiñ, annaurrauniaqtusi. "
5333, For with the heart one believes and thus has righteousness and with the mouth one confesses and thus has salvation. ,"Qanuq iñuk ukpiġuuruq uummanmiñiñ aasii nalaunŋasirauvluni sivuġaani God-im, suli quliaqtuaġutivlugich allat ukpiġilikkaġmiñik aasii annaurrauvluni. "
5334," For the scripture says, “Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame.” ","Bible uqaqtut, “Kiñaliqaa ukpiqtuaq Christ-mun, nunuuraliġumiñaipiaqtuq.” "
5335," For there is no distinction between the Jew and the Greek, for the same Lord is Lord of all, who richly blesses all who call on him. ","Jew-guruaġlu Jew-guŋitchuaġlu allagiiŋitchuk, atausiq Ataniq atanġuruq iluqaiññun, suli aitchuiruq suġaliŋiñik annautim iluqaiññun ququularuanun inmiñun aŋaiyyuvlutiŋ. "
5336, For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.,"Qanuq “Iñupayaaq ququularuaq aŋaiyyuvluni Ataniġmun, annaurrauniaqtuq.”"
5337, How are they to call on one they have not believed in? And how are they to believe in one they have not heard of? And how are they to hear without someone preaching to them? ,Iñuich aglaan ququulayumiñaitchut Ataniġmun ukpiliŋaitkumiŋ ilaanun. Suli ukpiġumiñaiñmiut tusaayugaaŋaitkumiŋ ilaanik. Tusaayugaaġumiñaiñmiut alġaqsruiraiḷḷutiŋ. 
5338," And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, “How timely is the arrival of those who proclaim the good news.” ","Alġaqsruirit alġaqsruiyumiñaiñmiut tilirauŋisuaġumiŋ. Alġaqsruiritigun uqaluk aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna, “Qanutun aliuġnaqtigiruq alġaqsruirit kukiḷuŋniŋat alġaqsruutigivlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq.” "
5339," But not all have obeyed the good news, for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” ","Aglaan tamatkiġḷutiŋ akuqtuŋaitkaat tusaayugaaġiksuaq. Inna Isaiah uqallaŋaruq, “Ataniiq, ukpiġivigruaŋaitkaat alġaqsruutiga ilimiŋnun.” "
5340," Consequently faith comes from what is heard, and what is heard comes through the preached word of Christ.",Tavra iñuich ukpiliġuurut Christ-mun tusaayugaaqamiŋ alġaqsruunmik Christ-kun.
5341," But I ask, have they not heard? Yes, they have: Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world. ","Aglaan apiqsriruŋa, tusaaŋaiḷgataqpat? Iḷumun tusaaŋarut, qanuq “Tusaayugaaġiksuat tikiurrauŋarut nunamun iluqaanun, suli iluqaiññun nunam iñuŋiñun.” "
5342," But again I ask, didn’t Israel understand? First Moses says, “I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; with a senseless nation I will provoke you to anger.” ","Apiqsrivsaaqtuŋa, Israel-guruat kaŋiqsiŋaitparruŋ tusaayugaaġiksuaq Christ-kun?

Annautiniaġitka allat kaŋiqsiŋaitchuat, aasii ilivsi qinnaiḷusi.” "
5343," And Isaiah is even bold enough to say, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I became well known to those who did not ask for me.” ","Isaiah suli taluqsrasuŋaġnani uqallaŋaruq, inna God uqallaŋnivḷugu, “Iñuich iḷisimaniugaŋitchuat iḷitchuġiŋagaanŋa.

5344," But about Israel he says, “All day long I held out my hands to this disobedient and stubborn people!” ","Israel-guruat God-im uqallausiġiŋagai inna, “Ataramik isaaqsimagaluaġikka tallika qaitquyummiiqł̣ugich kamaksriḷaitchuat qapiġnaqsruqtuallu iñuich.”"
5345," So I ask, God has not rejected his people, has he? Absolutely not! For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, from the tribe of Benjamin. ","Apiqsriruŋa inna, God-im pisunġiŋavagich iñuŋni? Naaggapiaġataq. Uvaŋaptauq uvva Paul Israel-gummiuŋa, kiŋunġuvluŋa Abraham-mun, iḷauvluŋa maŋŋuqaqtuanun Benjamin-mik. "
5346," God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew! Do you not know what the scripture says about Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel? ","God-im pisuŋaiŋaitkai iñuŋni iñuksraqtaani aullaqisaamiñqaŋa.

5347," “Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars; I alone am left and they are seeking my life!” ","“Ataniiq, tuqunŋagaich uqaqtitin kisiŋŋuqłuŋa, siquminŋagaich iñuich ikipkaivikaaŋich aŋaiyyukamiŋ iliŋnun, aasiuvva uvaŋa kisiŋŋuqtauruaŋa, iñuktaġiniaqsaammigaanŋa.” "
5348, But what was the divine response to him? “I have kept for myself seven thousand people who have not bent the knee to Baal.” ,"Tavra God-im kiuŋagaa, “Kisiŋŋuŋaitchutin. Piqaqtuŋa 7,000-nik iñuŋnik putinŋaisamnik aŋaiyyulutiŋ Baal-mun.” "
5349, So in the same way at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace. ,"Tavraptauq paŋmapak, iñugiaŋitchuanik Israel-guruanik iñuqaġmiuq God-im piksraqtaaŋiñik ukpiquvlugich, qanuq nagliktuutiqpaqaqłuni. "

5373," And even they – if they do not continue in their unbelief – will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. ",
5374," For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these natural branches be grafted back into their own olive tree?",
5375," For I do not want you to be ignorant of this mystery, brothers and sisters, so that you may not be conceited: A partial hardening has happened to Israel until the full number of the Gentiles has come in. ",

5401," Be devoted to one another with mutual love, showing eagerness in honoring one another. ","Piviuttaqqutisitchi avanmun, aniqatigiich piviuttaqqutimmatun avanmun. Nanġaġumałhaaqsigik allat nanġausiaqałhaaġniġmiñ ilivsi allaniñ. "
5402," Do not lag in zeal, be enthusiastic in spirit, serve the Lord. ","Suuramikunnii iqiakkiutinagu savaaqsi, aglaan savautisiuŋ Ataniq piyumalaaġlusi. "
5403," Rejoice in hope, endure in suffering, persist in prayer. ",Quviasugitchi niġiugnivsiññi isuitchuamik iñuggunmik. Qiñuitchitchi iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaŋmi. Aŋaiyyumaruagusitchi.

5406," Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. ",Quviasuqatigisigik quviasuktuat. Isumaaqatigisigik isumaaqtuat. 
5407, Live in harmony with one another; do not be haughty but associate with the lowly. Do not be conceited. ,"Iñuuniaqatigiigitchi atilusi avanmun, piġuqtiġnasi, aglaan piqasiqsuutisitchi kamasaaŋitchuanun. Isummatiginasi ilivsiññik iḷisimanasugalugich supayaurat."
5408, Do not repay anyone evil for evil; consider what is good before all people. ,"Iñuum pimaqłukpasi, akisaġnasi pimaqłuunmik iliŋiññun. Iñuulluataġitchi iñuich iluqaġmiŋ iḷisimayumaut nakuutilaavsiññik. "
5409," If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all people. ",Qanaaqatigitchaiḷiuŋ kiñapayaaq piyumiñaqtilaaqtun. Aguirrutaunak qanaaġutiksramun. 
5410," Do not avenge yourselves, dear friends, but give place to God’s wrath, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. ","Piviuttaġirauruasii, akisautinasi ilivsiññik, aglaan God-im tatavsaġligich pimaqłuktairuat ilivsiññik, qanuq aglausimaruq Bible-ni, God uqallaŋaruq inna, “Nalaunŋaruamik piñiaqtuŋa.

5411," Rather, if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will be heaping burning coals on his head. ","Aglaan, “Pimaqłuktaqtin kaakpan, niġipkaġuŋ. Imiġukpan, imiqtirruŋ. Tainna piguvich, kanŋutchaktinniaġiñ pimaqłuktaiñiŋagun iliŋnik.” "
5412," Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.","Pigiitchuamun akiiḷipkaġnasi, aglaan pigiitchuaq akiiḷisiuŋ nakuurualiqilusi."
5413," Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except by God’s appointment, and the authorities that exist have been instituted by God. ",Iñupayaaq kamakkutiqaġli ataniġnaqutiqaqtuanun. Qanuq kiñaliqaa ataniġnaqutiqaġumiñaitchuq God-im aitchuŋisuaqpani. Iluqatiŋ ataniġnaqutit ittuat God-im inillaŋagai. 
5414," So the person who resists such authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will incur judgment ","Taamna pisigivlugu iñuk akiḷḷiḷiqsuiruaq ataniġnaqusiraqtuanik, akiḷḷiḷiqsuġai God-im inillaktaŋi, aasii iñuich akiḷḷiḷiqsuutiruat tatavsaqtauniaqtut. "
5415," (for rulers cause no fear for good conduct but for bad). Do you desire not to fear authority? Do good and you will receive its commendation, ","Qanuq kiñaliqaa iñuuruaq nalaunŋaruakun sivuuqqataitchuq ataniġnaqusiraqtuanik, aglaan kisimiŋ tamatkua iñuumaqłuktuat.

5416," for it is God’s servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be in fear, for it does not bear the sword in vain. It is God’s servant to administer retribution on the wrongdoer. ","Qanuq God-im kivgaġigaa anniqsuqsaqłusi. Killuliqiguvsi, sivuuqqatiqaġitchi, qanuq suaŋŋatiqaqtuq tatavsaiyumiñaqłuni. Ilaa kivgauruq God-mun, tatavsaiyumiñaqłuni pisigilugu God killuliqirauruanun. "
5417," Therefore it is necessary to be in subjection, not only because of the wrath of the authorities but also because of your conscience. ","Tavraasii iluqasi kamaksriruksraupiaqtusi tatavsaqtauŋitchumausi, taamnatualuuŋiñmiuq, iḷisimarusi ilivsiññi nalaunŋatilaaŋanik kamaksriruni. "
5418," For this reason you also pay taxes, for the authorities are God’s servants devoted to governing. ","Taamna suli pisigilugu, akiḷiiruksraupiaqtusi taxes-nik kavammanun. Akiḷiusiqirit God-im kivgaġigai aasii savaaqtiŋ pigiññaġaat. "

","Akiḷiisitchi iluqaiññun ataniġnaqusiraqtuanun qanutupayaaq piqaqtuksraukpata. Akiḷiisitchi akiḷiutinik kavammanun suli akiḷiġḷugich tax-iutit tauqsiqavsi suġauttanik.

5420," Owe no one anything, except to love one another, for the one who loves his neighbor has fulfilled the law. ","Akiiḷaġnagu kiñapayaaq supayauramik. Piviuttaqqutisitchi avanmun, qanuq iñuk piviuttaqsriruaq siḷallimiñik, kamaksripiallaktuq pitquranik. "
5421," For the commandments, “Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not covet,” (and if there is any other commandment) are summed up in this, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” ","Qanuq pitqurat qaisauruat Moses-kun piraksriġaatigut inna. “Allatuġnak, Iñuaġnak, Tiglignak, Kaviuġnak,” suli allallu pitqurat. Taapkua iluqaisa tapusimagai uuma pitquram, “Piviuttaġiuŋ siḷalliñ iliktun iḷiḷugu.” "
5422, Love does no wrong to a neighbor. Therefore love is the fulfillment of the law. ,"Piviuttaġikapku siḷalliñ, pigiitchuamik piḷaitkiñ, tavra piviuttaqsriruam kamagipiallakkai pitqurat."
5423," And do this because we know the time, that it is already the hour for us to awake from sleep, for our salvation is now nearer than when we became believers. ","Aasiisuli annaurrauniksraq, Christ qiḷaŋmuutikpatigut, qallił̣haaqtuq paŋmapak ukpiqtuaġuqqaaġniptiŋniñ. Tavra iñuuruksraurusi nalaunŋaruakun, pisigilugu Christ qaiyasiñiŋa.

5425," Let us live decently as in the daytime, not in carousing and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in discord and jealousy. ","Iñuulluataqta iñupayaanun tautukkumiñaqsiḷugu sunapayaaq pikkaqput nakuutilaaŋanik.

5426," Instead, put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to arouse its desires.",Aglaan iñuusitchi tuvrapiaġlugu iñuusiġitqukkaŋa Atanġum Jesus Christ. Sivunniuġnasi pisuiqsitchuglugich pigiitchuat pisuguutisi.
5427," Now receive the one who is weak in the faith, and do not have disputes over differing opinions. ","Kiñaliqaa suaŋaitkaluaŋŋaan ukpiġutaa, paġlasiuŋ aŋaiyyuliqiruat kasimaniŋannun. Uqavaaqatigisuŋaġnagich sunik ukpiġiraqaġniŋat. "
5428," One person believes in eating everything, but the weak person eats only vegetables. ","Iñuich iḷaŋich ukpiqtut niġiḷḷanivḷutiŋ qanusiḷimaanik niqipianik.

5429," The one who eats everything must not despise the one who does not, and the one who abstains must not judge the one who eats everything, for God has accepted him. ","Iñuich niġiḷḷaruat qanusiḷimaanik niqinik isummatiginatiŋ nalaułhamaaġasugalutiŋ nauriałhiñanik niqiqaqtuaniñ.

5430," Who are you to pass judgment on another’s servant? Before his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. ","Kiñaliqaa nalaunŋaruamik uqallakkumiñaitchuq iñuum allam kivgaŋa killuliqinigumiuŋ. Ilaan nanmiñiq atanġata nalaunŋarualiñiaġaa naagga killuliqirualiñiaġaa.

5431," One person regards one day holier than other days, and another regards them all alike. Each must be fully convinced in his own mind. ","Iñuich iḷaŋich isumaqaqtut uvlut nalunaiqsaŋich Jew-guruat, aŋaiyyuniksrauvlugich nakuułhaaġnivḷugich allaniñ uvluniñ. Allalli isumaqaqtut uvlupayaurat atinivḷugich aŋaiyyuvigiruni Ataniq. Iñupayaaq piḷi, nalupqisuŋaiġḷuni nalaunŋarualiqitilaamiñik. "
5432," The one who observes the day does it for the Lord. The one who eats, eats for the Lord because he gives thanks to God, and the one who abstains from eating abstains for the Lord, and he gives thanks to God. ","Iñuich aŋaiyyuruat Ataniġmun nalunaiqsauruani uvluni, aŋaiyyurut nanġaġukługu Ataniq.

5433, For none of us lives for himself and none dies for himself. ,"Iñuuruksrauŋitchugut iviġagniaqsiññaġluta uvaptiŋnun, suli tuquyumiñaiñmiugut isumapianiaptiktun. "
5434," If we live, we live for the Lord; if we die, we die for the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s. ","Iñuuŋŋapta iñuurugut iviġagukługu Ataniq, suli tuqugaluaġmigupta, tuquniaġmiugut ilaan pisuutaagun. Tavraasii iñuugaluaġupta naagga tuqugaluaġupta, Atanġum pigigaatigut. "
5435," For this reason Christ died and returned to life, so that he may be the Lord of both the dead and the living. ","Taamna pisigivlugu Christ tuquŋaruq suli aŋivḷuni tuqqunmiñ, ilaa Ataniġitquvluni uvaptiŋnun iñuuŋŋapta tuquguptalu. "
5436, But you who eat vegetables only – why do you judge your brother or sister? And you who eat everything – why do you despise your brother or sister? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. ,"Uqalliaruksrauŋitchusi aniqatisi killukuaġniḷugich, aasiiḷivsauq ilivsi uqalliaruksrauŋiñmiusi nalaułhaaġniḷusi aniqatiivsiññiñ. Iluqata makittuksrauniaqtugut God-im isivġiivianun iñuŋnik. "
5437," For it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will give praise to God.” ","Sivuniġivlugu taamna aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna,"
5438," Therefore, each of us will give an account of himself to God. ","Tamatkua tainnainniġmata, tavraŋŋaaglaan aniqatiivut uqausiġiŋaiġḷavut killukuaqtaġniḷugich, aglaan qaunagiłhaaqta agvisausuŋiḷḷuta aniqatipta piḷuksiñiksraŋanun. "
5439," Therefore we must not pass judgment on one another, but rather determine never to place an obstacle or a trap before a brother or sister. ","Iḷisimaruŋa ukpiġunmalu Ataniġmun Jesus-mun nalupqisuktinŋitkaaŋa, sumik piisilaaŋanik killuliqutauyumiñaqtuamik niġiruni niqipiamik. Aglaan iñuk isumagumi killuliqiniaġasugaluni niġiruksrauŋitchuq, qanuq killukuaġutauniaqtuq ilaanun. "
5440," I know and am convinced in the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean in itself; still, it is unclean to the one who considers it unclean. ","Niġiñiġuvich aniqarvich isummatigikkaŋanik niġiraksrauŋiññivḷugu aasii isumanŋutchakługu, piviuttaġiŋaiġñiġiñ aniqatin. Suksraunġiġñagu aniqatin Christ tuqqutiŋakkaŋa niġiḷutin isummatigikkaŋanik pigiitchuaguvlugu. "
5441," For if your brother or sister is distressed because of what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy by your food someone for whom Christ died. ","Suna piññagu iłuigutchautiginiakkaŋa aniqarvich, iḷisimaluġiñ unnii nalaunŋatilaaŋanik ilivich pigupku. "
5442, Therefore do not let what you consider good be spoken of as evil. ,"Qanuq naumaniqsraq ukpiqtuat aŋalatittuat God-mun, piraksraŋat niġikkaptiguaŋitchuq imikkaptigullu, aglaan iñuuluni nalaunŋaruakun, pigilugu aŋuyautairrun, quviasuullu Ilitqusiġiksuakun. "
5443," For the kingdom of God does not consist of food and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. ","Iñuk savaurriruaq Christ-mik iñuuvluni tainna, God-im iviġaumagigaa, iñuiḷḷu iviġaumagimmigaat."
5444, For the one who serves Christ in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.,Tavraasii pisa supayaamik aŋuyautaiññaqtuamik sivunmuktuutauyumiñaqtuamiglu ukpiġunmun. 
5445," So then, let us pursue what makes for peace and for building up one another. ","Pisigigiññaġlugu niġiḷḷaniq qanusipayaamik niqimik, maqunnagu God-im savaaŋa. Killuliqutauŋiḷḷuqtuq unnii niġiñiq qanusipayaanik niqinik, killuliqutauruq allat piḷuksipkaġuvsigik niġikkavsigun. "
5446," Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. For although all things are clean, it is wrong to cause anyone to stumble by what you eat. ",Killukuaŋaruq niqipiaqtuqtuni taaŋŋiqiruniḷu suli supayaakkaluamik piuni piḷuksipkautauyumiñaqtuamik aniqatinun. 
5447, It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything that causes your brother to stumble. ,"Qanusipayaamik ukpiġutiqaġuvich niġiñikun niqipianik, nalupqinaigilugu piyumautin iviġaktilaaŋanik God, uqavaaġutigiŋaiġḷugu avanmun.

5448," The faith you have, keep to yourself before God. Blessed is the one who does not judge himself by what he approves. ","Aglaan iñuk niġiruaq niqipiamik isummatigillaan killukuaġutaunivḷugu, piḷuksiruq, qanuq iñuuŋitchuq tuvraġlugu ukpiġikkani. Qanuq sunapayaaq piguptigu ukpiġikkaqput nalautkaluaġnagu piḷuutauruq."
5449," But the man who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not do so from faith, and whatever is not from faith is sin.",
5450," But we who are strong ought to bear with the failings of the weak, and not just please ourselves. ","Tavra uvagut suaŋaruaguut ukpiġutiptiŋni, qiñuiġḷuta ikayugaksraġigivut tamatkua suaŋaitchuat ukpiġunmiŋni, iviġagniaqsiññaŋaiġḷuta uvaptiŋnun. "
5451, Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up. ,"Atausiullaaluta iluqata iviġagniaġlavut siḷallivut anniqsuqsaġlugich, suaŋasiyumaut ukpiġunmiŋni. "
5452," For even Christ did not please himself, but just as it is written, “The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me.” ","Qanuq Christ inmiñun iviġagniaqsiññaŋaitchuq. Aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna, “Iñuich uqamaqłuktaqtuat ilipkun, Aapaaŋ, uqamaqłuktaġvigiŋagaanŋa uvaŋałhaaq.” "
5453," For everything that was written in former times was written for our instruction, so that through endurance and through encouragement of the scriptures we may have hope. ","Iluqaġmiŋ aglausimaruat Bible-ni iŋiḷġaan, aglaagurut iḷisautisaqłuta qiñuirrunmik qapiŋaisaaqłutalu, niġiuquvluta iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. "
5454," Now may the God of endurance and comfort give you unity with one another in accordance with Christ Jesus, ","God-im qiñuisitkaatigut quviasaaqłutalu. Aasii ilaan iñuupkaġlisi aŋuyautaiḷḷusi avanmun, nalaupiaġlugu Christ iñuutqutaa ilivsiññun. "
5455, so that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Tainna iñuuguvsi, iluqasi atautchisun iñuktun nanġaġumiñaġniaġiksi God, Aapaŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ."
5456," Receive one another, then, just as Christ also received you, to God’s glory. ","Taamna pisigilugu, paġlatisitchi avanmun, tainnatuttauq Christ paġlaŋagaasi, God nanġausiaqaquvlugu. "
5457," For I tell you that Christ has become a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God’s truth to confirm the promises made to the fathers, ","Itqaumasiuŋ Christ kivgaliutiŋaruq Jew-guruanun, salapqiġukługu God-im ukpiġnaqtilaaŋa, suli taŋŋiqsaqługich unniqsuqłiisit God-im unniqsuqłiisigiŋakkaŋich maŋŋuŋiññun, "

5462," Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you believe in him, so that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. ","Savaqatauniqama Christ-mun, uqaqpagaaġutigiyumiñaġiga savaurriñiġa God-mik. "
5463," But I myself am fully convinced about you, my brothers and sisters, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.

Alġaqsruiŋaruŋa tusaayugaaġiksuamik Christ-kun sumiḷiqaa Jerusalem-miñ Illyricum-munaglaan. "
5465," to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles. I serve the gospel of God like a priest, so that the Gentiles may become an acceptable offering, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.

5468," in the power of signs and wonders, in the power of the Spirit of God. So from Jerusalem even as far as Illyricum I have fully preached the gospel of Christ. ","Aasii paŋmapak alġaqsruiviksraiġutikama makkunani nunaaqqiñi, suli iñugiaktuani ukiuni ullakkumaalġataŋagaluaqavsi, "

5473," when I go to Spain. For I hope to visit you when I pass through and that you will help me on my journey there, after I have enjoyed your company for a while. ","Tavraasii taamna pianikkupku, qaisanikkupkich maniich iliŋiññun, Spain-mun iglausaġniaqtuŋa nalaullusi. "
5474, But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints. ,"Iḷisimaruŋa ullakkuvsi anniqsuusiaqaġniaqtusi, qanuq ukpiġurri Christ-mun suaŋasiḷaaqtauniaqtuq."
5475, For Macedonia and Achaia are pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem. ,"Aniqatiit, atausiŋŋuqatauŋarusi Christ-mun, suli Ilitqusiġiksuam piviuttaqqutipkaġaasi avanmun. Taamna tainnainman, apiġipiaġataġivsi aŋaiyyutipiaġataquvluŋa God-mun, "
5476," For they were pleased to do this, and indeed they are indebted to the Jerusalem saints. For if the Gentiles have shared in their spiritual things, they are obligated also to minister to them in material things. ","annaurrautquluŋa ukpiŋaitchuaniñ Judea-mittuaniñ, taapkualu aitchuutit ukpiqtuanun Jerusalem-mi akuqtuqulugich. "
5477," Therefore after I have completed this and have safely delivered this bounty to them, I will set out for Spain by way of you, ","Tavraasii ullagniaġivsi quviasugluŋa, Atanġum pisuutigikpagu, aasii qapiŋaisaaġusiaqaġluŋa ilivsiññiñ. "
5478, and I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of Christ’s blessing. ,God-im aitchuiruam tutqiunmik itqatigilisi iluqasi ataramik. Amen.
5479," Now I urge you, brothers and sisters, through our Lord Jesus Christ and through the love of the Spirit, to join fervently with me in prayer to God on my behalf. ",
5480," Pray that I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea and that my ministry in Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints, ",
5481, so that by God’s will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company. ,
5482, Now may the God of peace be with all of you. Amen.,
5483," From Paul, called to be an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Sosthenes, our brother, ","Ukua tuyuutit qairut ilivsiññun Paul-miñ, God-im ququaŋaraŋaniñ tilirautquvlugu Christ Jesus-mun, aniqatiptiŋniḷḷu Sosthenesmiñ. "
5484," to the church of God that is in Corinth, to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, and called to be saints, with all those in every place who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours. ","Tuyuutaurut ilivsiññun Corinth-miittuanun, God-mun aŋaiyyuliqiruanun, ilaaguaqtauruanun God-mun ukpiqłutiŋ Christ Jesus-mun, God-im ququaqtaŋiñun iñugisukługich, iḷagivlugich iñupayaurat sumiḷiqaa aŋaiyyusuuruat Ataniptiŋnun Jesus Christ-mun, ilaisaptauq Ataniġikkaŋannun.

5485, Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!,"Nagliktuusiaqpaqaġitchi tutqiunmiglu God-miñ Aapaptiŋniñ, Ataniptiŋniḷḷu Jesus Christ-miñ."
5486, I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God that was given to you in Christ Jesus. ,Ataramik quyyavigisuugiga God pisigivlugich nagliktuutiqpakun ikayuusiasi ilaan aitchuutigikkaŋi ukpiliqavsiqaŋa Christ Jesus-mun. 
5487," For you were made rich in every way in him, in all your speech and in every kind of knowledge – ","God-im savaŋagai iñuutchisi nakuusił̣haaqługich uqaqtuaġumiñaqsivḷusi ataramik inmigun, suli iḷitchuġiyumiñaqsivḷusi iluqaanik iḷumun ittuamiñik. "
5488, just as the testimony about Christ has been confirmed among you – ,Nutauruakun iñuuniaġusiḷiutikkavsigun iḷisimanaqsiŋagiksi nalupqinaiqł̣ugu akuqtuiŋatilaaqsi tusaayugaaġiksuamik Christ-kun. 
5489, so that you do not lack any spiritual gift as you wait for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Suli ayuqsraŋił̣ł̣usi qanusipayaamik aitchuusiamik Ilitqusiġiksuam aitchuutaanik, utaqqiḷḷavsi qaiñiksraŋanik Atanipta Jesus Christ. "

5491," God is faithful, by whom you were called into fellowship with his son, Jesus Christ our Lord.","God ukpiġnapiaqtuq, aasii ququaŋagaasi piqatautquvlusi allanun iḷauraaliutiniġmi Iġñiġmiñun Jesus Christ-mun Ataniptiŋnun."
5492," I urge you, brothers and sisters, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, to agree together, to end your divisions, and to be united by the same mind and purpose. ","Aniqatiit, iluqata atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruaguut Ataniptiŋnun Jesus Christ-mun, piviuttaġivlusi apiġigivsi atitquvlusi, ilivsiguaqtaŋaiġḷusi aglaan atiruamik isumaqaquvlusi, suli atiruamik isivġiutiqaġlusi. "
5493," For members of Chloe’s household have made it clear to me, my brothers and sisters, that there are quarrels among you. ","Qanuq quliaqtuaġutiŋagaanŋa Chloe-m iḷaŋisa qanaaġutisuunivḷusi, aniqatiitkaa. "
5494," Now I mean this, that each of you is saying, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” or “I am with Cephas,” or “I am with Christ.” ",Uvvauna sivuniġigiga. Atausiullaavlusi uqaġuumavlusi uvaŋa Paul-kuayaaguruŋa naagga Apollos-kuayaaguruŋa naaggaqaa uvaŋa Cephas-kuayaaguruŋa naagga uvaŋa Christ-kuaqtuŋa. 
5495," Is Christ divided? Paul wasn’t crucified for you, was he? Or were you in fact baptized in the name of Paul? ",Tainna Christ avguqsiyumiñaitchuq. Iḷisimarusi uvaŋauŋitchuq Paul-guruaŋaa kikiaktuurrauŋaruaq aŋarrauramun pisivlusi. Iḷisimammiusi uvaŋa Paul-guruaŋaa atausiŋŋuqatigiŋaitkivsiŋa paptaiqsaukavsi. 
5496," I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, ","Quyammiuŋa paptaiqsiŋaiññama iluqavsiññik aglaan Crispus-mik Gaius-miglu, "
5497, so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name! ,iḷaanni iḷari uqallakkayaġugnaqtuaq atausiŋŋuqatauniḷuni uvamnun paptaiqsaukami. 
5498," (I also baptized the household of Stephanus. Otherwise, I do not remember whether I baptized anyone else.) ",Paptaiqsiŋagaluaġmiuŋa igluqatiŋiñik Stephanas. Taavruma allaagun naluruŋa paptaiqsiŋatilaamnik kimik. 
5499," For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel – and not with clever speech, so that the cross of Christ would not become useless.","Qanuq Christ tiliŋaitkaaŋa paptaiqsiyyaquluŋa aglaan alġaqsruitquvluŋa tusaayugaaġiksuamik. Aglaan alġaqsruikama uqayupiaġataġluŋa iñugruiññaich isumattutaatigun piḷaitchuŋa, iḷaanni iñuich uqayupiaġataġniġma maliksuktitpiaġai, iḷumun ittuałhaaŋiḷaam Christ tuqqutaata aŋarraurami."
5500," For the message about the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God. ","Qanuq alġaqsruiñiq ilaan tuqqutaagun pisigivlugich iñuich piḷuutiŋich, qiññaqaqtuq asiḷiqqutauruatun iñuŋnun suksrauyumaaqtuanun. Aglaan uvaptiŋnun annaurrauruanun, suaŋŋatigigaa God-im. "
5501," For it is written, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will thwart the cleverness of the intelligent.” ",Bible-ni aglausimaruq inna.
5502, Where is the wise man? Where is the expert in the Mosaic law? Where is the debater of this age? Has God not made the wisdom of the world foolish? ,"Isummatigisitchi ilivsiññun, aniqatiit, ilivsi ququaqtauŋaruasii ukpiquvlusi. Iñugiaŋitchusi isumaturuaguŋaruasii, iñuich naipiqtuutaatigun. Iñugiaŋiñmiusi atanaurauruat. Iñugiaŋiñmiusi aniŋaruasii suġalliruatigun. "
5503," For since in the wisdom of God the world by its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe by the foolishness of preaching. ","Qanuq God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagai iñuich isumakkusiaqaqtuat nunam iñuŋiñiñ isumalluaġiiññivḷugich, kanŋutchaksaqługich isumatunasugiruat inmiŋnun isummatigikamiŋ. Tainnatuttauq God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagai suaŋaitchualiaŋich iñuich naipiqtuunmikkun, kanŋutchaktitchaqługich suaŋanirauruat. "
5504," For Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks ask for wisdom, ","Aasiisuli God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagai iñuich kamasaaŋitchuat, suuŋiḷaġirauruallu, isumakkusiaqaqtuallu suuŋiḷatun nunam iñuŋiñiñ, ilaan suuŋiḷaġuqtitchaqługich iñuich kamanaqtualirauruat. "
5505," but we preach about a crucified Christ, a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles. ","Tainna God piŋaruq, atausiuraq-unnii iñuk uqavigaaġumiñaiqsaqługu sivuqqamiñi. "
5506," But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. ","God-im aitchuŋagaasi iñuullasivḷusi isuitchuamun, qanuq atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagiksi Christ. Aasii atausiŋŋuqatigiŋakaptigu Christ, ilaan isumatusipkaŋagaatigut God-im isumattutaanik, suli nalaunŋasivḷuta, ilaaguaqłutalu God-mun, suli tasuqłuta. Tainna God sivunniuŋaniqsuq, "
5507," For the foolishness of God is wiser than human wisdom, and the weakness of God is stronger than human strength.","taŋŋiġumiñaqsisaqługu aglausimaruaq Bible-ni inna, “Iñuk uqavigaaġniaġumi uqavigaaġutiqaġli Atanġum iñiqtaŋiñik.”"
5508," Think about the circumstances of your call, brothers and sisters. Not many were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were born to a privileged position. ",
5509," But God chose what the world thinks foolish to shame the wise, and God chose what the world thinks weak to shame the strong. ",
5510," God chose what is low and despised in the world, what is regarded as nothing, to set aside what is regarded as something, ",
5511, so that no one can boast in his presence. ,
5512," He is the reason you have a relationship with Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption, ",
5513," so that, as it is written, “Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord.”",
5514," When I came to you, brothers and sisters, I did not come with superior eloquence or wisdom as I proclaimed the testimony of God. ","Aniqatiit, tikiññama ilivsiññun, alġaqsruiŋaitchuŋa God-im uqaluanik uqayupiaġataqtuam uqaluŋiñik atuġluŋa iñugruiññauvlu isumattutaagun, "
5515," For I decided to be concerned about nothing among you except Jesus Christ, and him crucified. ",qanuq sivunniŋavluŋa alġaqsruutigisukługu kisian Jesus Christ tuquŋaniŋalu aŋarraurami. 
5516, And I was with you in weakness and in fear and with much trembling. ,Alġaqsruiŋaruŋa ilivsiññun suaŋaił̣ł̣uŋa iqsipiaqłuŋalu uuliksivḷuŋalu iviġaumasukługu God. 
5517," My conversation and my preaching were not with persuasive words of wisdom, but with a demonstration of the Spirit and of power, ","Suli alġaqsruikama, maliksuguksaaŋitkivsi iñugruiññaum isumattutaagun, aglaan uvapkuaqługu Ilitqusiġiksuam iḷitchuġipkaŋagaa suaŋŋatini. "
5518, so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on the power of God.,"Tainna alġaqsruiŋaruŋa God-im suaŋŋataanun ukpiliqsitquvlusi, iñuum isumattutiŋił̣aaŋanun."
5519," Now we do speak wisdom among the mature, but not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are perishing. ","Aasiivsauq aulayaiġḷuataŋavlutiŋ ukpiġunmiŋni ukpiqtuaguruanun, iḷisaurrisuugaluaġmiugut isumattunmik, aglaan isumattutauŋił̣ł̣uni isummatiqausiatitun ukpiŋaitchuat naagga atanaurauruat nunami, suksraunġiqsauyumaaqtuat. "
5520," Instead we speak the wisdom of God, hidden in a mystery, that God determined before the ages for our glory. ","Aglaan iḷisaurrutigigikput God-im isumattutaa iriqsimaŋaruaq, kaŋiqsiḷaisaŋat iŋiḷġaan taimani. God savaŋaiñŋaġmiunnii nunamik, sivunniŋaniqsuq taavrumuŋa isumattunmun piqataullasiñiaġnivḷuta ilaan kamanaunmiñun. "
5521," None of the rulers of this age understood it. If they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. ","Nalliataunnii atanauraŋisa mattuma nunam taamna kaŋiqsiŋaitkaat, qanuq kaŋiqsiŋagumirruŋ, kikiaktuutinayaitkaat Atanġa qaumaniqpaum. "
5522," But just as it is written, “Things that no eye has seen, or ear heard, or mind imagined, are the things God has prepared for those who love him.” ","Taapkua iñuich kaŋiqsiŋaitkaat aglautiŋaruaq Bible-ni inna,"
5523," God has revealed these to us by the Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. ","Aasii taamna iḷisaurrutigigikput uqaluktigun iḷisausiaptigun Ilitqusiġiksuamiñ, iñugruiññaich isumattutiŋił̣aaŋatigun, sivuniqsiñaqsiñiaqługich iḷumun ittuat, satqummiŋaraŋi Ilitqusiġiksuam iñuŋnun piqaqtuanun Ilitqusiġiksuamik. "
5524," For who among men knows the things of a man except the man’s spirit within him? So too, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. ","Iñuum piqaŋitchuam Ilitqusiġiksuamik aitchuusiaġiyumiñaitkai sut God-im Ilitqusiġiksuaŋan aitchuutiŋi, qanuq asiḷiqqutaurut ilaanun iñuŋmun. Kaŋiqsiyuminaitkai qanuq qanuqitilaaġumiñatualukkaich kisimiŋ iñuich puttuqsripkairiqaqtuat Ilitqusiġiksuamik. "
5525," Now we have not received the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God. ","Iñuum puttuqsripkairiqaqtuam Ilitqusiġiksuamik qanuqitilaaġai supayaat, aasii ilaa qanuqitilaaqtiqaġumiñaitchuq allanik kaŋiqsisiqaŋitchuanik inmisun. "
5526," And we speak about these things, not with words taught us by human wisdom, but with those taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things to spiritual people. ","Qanuq,"
5527," The unbeliever does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him. And he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. ",
5528," The one who is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is understood by no one. ",
5529," For who has known the mind of the Lord, so as to advise him? But we have the mind of Christ.",
5530," So, brothers and sisters, I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but instead as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ. ","Aglaan taimani nayuqavsi, aniqatiit, iḷisautiyumiñaiñŋagivsi iñuktun iḷiḷusi puttuqsriruatun Ilitqusiġiksuakun, qanuq ukpiqsaqpaallukłusi. Inŋavlusi ukpiŋaitchuatun kaŋiqsiñmi, suli miqłiqtuuratun iłłusi ukpiġutivsiññi. "
5531," I fed you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready. In fact, you are still not ready, ","Iḷisaurrutitka ilivsiññun siġḷiġnaiñŋarut. Miqłiqtuuraq immułhiñamik imiqtuksraummatun niqipiaqtullasiŋaił̣ł̣uni, tainnatun itqanaiñŋaiñmiusi iḷisaurrutiksranun agliraksraiŋaruat ukpiqtuat kaŋiqsiḷḷakkaŋiññun. Paŋmapak-unnii itqanaiñŋitchusi. "
5532," for you are still influenced by the flesh. For since there is still jealousy and dissension among you, are you not influenced by the flesh and behaving like unregenerate people? ","Qanuq uvva paŋmapak-unnii iñuuruagurusi ukpiŋaitchuatun. Killuqqutivlusi avanmun, qanaaġutivlusiḷu, ukpiŋaitchuatun ittusi, aullasiqaqtusi iñugruiññatun. "
5533," For whenever someone says, “I am with Paul,” or “I am with Apollos,” are you not merely human?","Qanuq ilivsiññik aŋalattusi iñugruiññatun iḷasi uqaġmata Paul-muktuqtuŋa, allalli uqaqłutiŋ, uvaŋa Apollos-muktuqtuŋa."
5534," What is Apollos, really? Or what is Paul? Servants through whom you came to believe, and each of us in the ministry the Lord gave us. ","Suliqutauva Apollos? Suliqutauva Paul? Kivgałhiñak uvaguk ukpiġikkaptiguk, Atanġum ukpiliqsinmasi Apollos-kullu uvapkullu God-im piraksriutillaaŋatun uvaptiŋnun. "
5535," I planted, Apollos watered, but God caused it to grow. ","Alġaqsruiñiqpuk akunnavsiññi uuktuutiqaġumiñaqtuq nautchirriqirim savaaŋanik. Uvaŋa urriqatigiluŋa nautchirriiruatun nautchiaksranik, aasiiḷi Apollos imiġmik aiḷaqtiġimmatun nautchirriutauruanik, aasiiḷi God-im naupkaqługich. "
5536," So neither the one who plants counts for anything, nor the one who waters, but God who causes the growth. ","Tavraasii iñuk nautchirriiruaq iñuglu aiḷaqtiġiruaq suvigruaguŋitchuk, aglaan God kisimi naumaruq qanuq naupkaiḷḷaruq. "
5537," The one who plants and the one who waters work as one, but each will receive his reward according to his work. ","Nautchirriiruaġlu aiḷaqtiġiruaġlu atiruk, aasii inmikkullaa akiḷiusiaqaġniaqtuk savaallaamikkun. "
5538," We are coworkers belonging to God. You are God’s field, God’s building. ","Qanuq uvaguk savaqatigiiksuguk God pisivlugu, aasii ilivsiḷi God-im nautchiaqaġvigimmatun. Aasiisuli igluqpaktun inmiusi God-im nappakkaŋatun."
5539," According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master-builder I laid a foundation, but someone else builds on it. And each one must be careful how he builds. ","Sanatuvluni qaukłiuruatun igluqpiritun, inillaŋagiga maŋŋuksraq, taŋŋiqł̣ugu savaaksrirrutaa God-im uvamnun. Taavruma maŋŋuliutiruam qaaŋanun allali iñuk nappairuq. Iñullaa qaunakłaaġli qanuq nappaisilaamiñik taavrumuŋa maŋŋuliutauŋaruamun. "
5540," For no one can lay any foundation other than what is being laid, which is Jesus Christ. ","Allamik maŋŋuksramik iñuk iḷisiyumiñaitchuq taamna anaglugu iḷirauŋaruaq, sivuniqaqtuaq Jesus Christ-mik. "
5541," If anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, or straw, ",Iñuich aglaan nappaiyumiñaġmiut maŋŋuliutauŋaruamun akisuruanik sunik maqulaitchuanik naaggaqaa akiisuuranik sunik maquyaruanik. 
5542," each builder’s work will be plainly seen, for the Day will make it clear, because it will be revealed by fire. And the fire will test what kind of work each has done. ","Iñullaam savaaŋa satqummiġñiaqtuq isivġiġvium uvluani. Qanuq taavrumani uvlumi iñullaam savaaŋa qanuġumiñaġniaġaa igniġum, aasii igniġum uuktuġniaġaa qanusiutilaaŋanik iñullaam savaaŋa. "
5543," If what someone has built survives, he will receive a reward. ","Iñuum kialiqaa savaaŋa nappaŋakkaŋa maŋŋuliutauŋaruamun, igniġum ikiŋitpagu ilaa akiḷiusiaqaġniaqtuq. "
5544," If someone’s work is burned up, he will suffer loss. He himself will be saved, but only as through fire.","Iñuum kialiqaa savaaŋa ikiraukpan, ilaa akiḷiusiaqaġniaŋitchuq, ilaa annaurraupqaatchiaġmiḷuni igniġmiñ annaurraukami."
5545, Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit lives in you? ,"Nalupqinaitchuamik puttuqsrimarusi God-im iñuutilaaŋanik iḷuvsiññi. Ilivsi ittusi ilaan aŋaiyyuviatun, suli God-im Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa iñuuvluni iḷuvsiññi. "
5546," If someone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, which is what you are.","Kialiqaa maqutpagu taamna God-im aŋaiyyuvia, God-iptauq suksraunġiġñiaġmigaa ilaa. Qanuq God-im aŋaiyyuvia ilaaguaqtauruq ilaanun, aasii ilivsi ilaan aŋaiyyuvigigaasi."
5547," Guard against self-deception, each of you. If someone among you thinks he is wise in this age, let him become foolish so that he can become wise. ","Kiñaliqaa sagluqinani inmiñik. Iñuk akunnavsiññi isumagumi isumatunasugaluni, iñugruiññaich isummasiatitun isummatigikamirruŋ isumattun, ilaa isumalluaġiiġḷi isumattutinikkumauq God-im isumattutaanik. "
5548," For the wisdom of this age is foolishness with God. As it is written, “He catches the wise in their craftiness.” ","Qanuq isumattutaat ukpiŋaitchuat asiḷiqqutauruq God-mi. Taamna sivuniġivlugu aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna, “God-im isumatusaaruat pisaupkaġaġigai ilaisa pisaasuqsaaniaġutaannun.” "
5549," And again, “The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile.” ","Aasiisuli aglausimavsaaqłuni, “Atanġum iḷisimagai isumaŋich isumaturuat asiḷiqqutautilaaŋat.” "
5550," So then, no more boasting about mere mortals! For everything belongs to you, ","Tamatkua tainnainniġmata, kiñaliqaa uqavigaaġutiqaŋaiḷḷi iñuich nalliŋiññuktuġniḷuni atautchimunmuktaqtuat, qanuq supayaat pigigisi ikayuqsaqłusi, "
5551," whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future. Everything belongs to you, ","Paul-lu Apollos-lu Cephas-lu God-im nunaŋalu iñuggullu tuqqullu paŋmapak iñuuniqsiḷu, iñuggutigiyumaakkaqsiḷu, iluqaisa pigigisi, "
5552," and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.","aasiisuli Christ pigigaasi, aasiiḷivsauq Christ God-im pigimmigaa."
5553, One should think about us this way – as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. ,"Uvagut iḷisaurrit isummatigiraksraurugut Christ-mun kivgaġiniḷuta, aitchuusiaqaqłuta savaaksrapiaġatamik iḷisaurriruaguluta God-im iḷumun ittuaŋanik kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruamik sivuani. "
5554, Now what is sought in stewards is that one be found faithful. ,Tavraasii kivgat niġiugiraurut ataramik ukpiġnaqtuksraupiaqługich. 
5555," So for me, it is a minor matter that I am judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself. ",Kivgalluatauŋavik uvaŋa? Qanupayaaq ilivsi allallu iñuich isummatigigaluaqpanŋa uŋiarrisaġiŋitkiga. Uvamnun unnii pimaqłuktualiŋitchuŋa. 
5556," For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not acquitted because of this. The one who judges me is the Lord. ","Isummatigiŋitchuŋa pasiñaġumiñaġluŋa kivgaumaqłuŋniḷuŋa, aglaan taamna sivuniqaŋitchuq pasiñaġumiñaiññiḷuŋa. Ataniq isivġiiruq uvamnik. "
5557," So then, do not judge anything before the time. Wait until the Lord comes. He will bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the motives of hearts. Then each will receive recognition from God.","Uqaġnasi iñuich pasiraksraġuġniḷugich isivġiġvium sivuani, Atanġum qaiviksraŋata sivuani.

5558," I have applied these things to myself and Apollos because of you, brothers and sisters, so that through us you may learn “not to go beyond what is written,” so that none of you will be puffed up in favor of the one against the other.

5601, Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Should I take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never! ,"Nalupqinaitchuamik puttuqsriŋarusi Christ-mun pigitilaaŋiññik timisi. Timaan iḷagimmatun itkai.

5609," A husband should give to his wife her sexual rights, and likewise a wife to her husband. ","Aŋun taŋŋiimaaqtuksrauruq uiguruam piraksraŋiñik nuliamiñun, tainnatuttauq aġnaq piruksraummiuq uimiñun. Avanmun anniqsuutigiiksuksrauruk pigiraksraġikkaġmikkun. "

5611," Do not deprive each other, except by mutual agreement for a specified time, so that you may devote yourselves to prayer. Then resume your relationship, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.

5620," For the unbelieving husband is sanctified because of the wife, and the unbelieving wife because of her husband. Otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy. ","Qanuq ukpiŋaitchuaq uiŋa atausiŋŋuqatauŋavluni ukpiŋaruamun nuliamiñun katitinnamiŋ, qallił̣haaqtuq God-mun tuvaaqatiniŋaiññiġmiñiñ ukpiqtuamik.

5621," But if the unbeliever wants a divorce, let it take place. In these circumstances the brother or sister is not bound. God has called you in peace.

Or how do you know, husband, whether you will bring your wife to salvation?","Nuliaguruatiin, avinŋitkupku uigikkan iḷaanni annaurraupkaġniaġiñ.

5623," Nevertheless, as the Lord has assigned to each one, as God has called each person, so must he live. I give this sort of direction in all the churches. ","Aglaan sivunniiguvsi tamatkuniŋa nalupqigiŋiḷḷugu piyumausi iñuutilaaqsi God-im sivunniutaa tuvraqługu ilivsiññun, illusi irrusiġiŋaravsiññi ukpiqqaaqavsi.

5624, Was anyone called after he had been circumcised? He should not try to undo his circumcision. Was anyone called who is uncircumcised? He should not get circumcised. ,"Uvvauna sivuniġigiga.

5628," For the one who was called in the Lord as a slave is the Lord’s freedman. In the same way, the one who was called as a free person is Christ’s slave. ","Iñuk kivgaullaġmi ukpiliqsitauŋaruaq Ataniġmun, atanġitchuq Atanġum sivuġaani. Tainnatuttauq iñuk kivgauŋitchuaq ukpiliqsitaukami, Christ-mun kivgaliutiruq. "
5629, You were bought with a price. Do not become slaves of men. ,"Christ tauqsiŋagaasi, akiḷiutivlusi tuquvluni pisivlusi. Tavraasii ilaa kamagiłhamaagaksraġigiksi tamatkunaŋŋaunnii atanaurauruaniñ nunami. "
5630," In whatever situation someone was called, brothers and sisters, let him remain in it with God.","Tavra aniqatiit qanusipayaami irviqaŋagumi iñullaa ukpiqtitauqqaaqami, tavrani illi piqatigilugu God."
5631," With regard to the question about people who have never married, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my opinion as one shown mercy by the Lord to be trustworthy. ","Paŋmapagli sivuniġilugich tuvaaqataitchuat, pitqurriutiksraitchuŋa Ataniġmiñ. Aglaan ukpiġnaqtuaguvluŋa kivgaunimni nagliktuutaagun Atanġum, qaitkiga uvaŋa isummatiga. "
5632, Because of the impending crisis I think it best for you to remain as you are. ,"Isumaruŋa nalaunŋanasugalugu iñuk iñuukpan irrusiġikkaġmisun, pisigilugu tavraġuqtuaq iłuiḷḷiuġun. "
5633, The one bound to a wife should not seek divorce. The one released from a wife should not seek marriage. ,Tuvaaqatiqaqpich? Avinniaqsaanak. Tuvaaqataitpich? Tuvaaqataiḷaaġiñ. 
5634," But if you marry, you have not sinned. And if a virgin marries, she has not sinned. But those who marry will face difficult circumstances, and I am trying to spare you such problems. ","Aglaan tuvaaqatinikkuvich piḷuksiŋitchutin. Suli niviaqsiaq tuvaaqatinikkumi piḷuksiŋitchuq.

5635," And I say this, brothers and sisters: The time is short. So then those who have wives should be as those who have none, ","Uvva una sivuniġigiga aniqatiit.

5636," those with tears like those not weeping, those who rejoice like those not rejoicing, those who buy like those without possessions, ","Tainnatuttauq ipiqtusuutit, naagga quviasuutit, naagga suġalġich piñaiḷutchiqsuqtaksraġiŋitkaatigut savaurriñiksraptiŋniñ Ataniġmik. "
5637, those who use the world as though they were not using it to the full. For the present shape of this world is passing away.,"Tamatkualu atugaqaqtuat nunam piŋiñik piññagniaqsiññaġniġmun iñuuŋaiġḷutiŋ, qanuq manna nuna suġauttaqtuummaġmi piiġumaaqtuq."
5638," And I want you to be free from concern. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord. ","Isumaaluutiqaquŋitkivsi. Tuvaaqataitchuaq isumasuŋaiññaġuuruq qanutchikun savautiyumiñaqtilaaŋanik Ataniq, ataramik iviġagukługu. "
5639," But a married man is concerned about the things of the world, how to please his wife, ","Aglaalli tuvaaqatiqaqtuaq isumasuŋaiññaġuuruq nunam suġautaŋiñun, qanuġlugu iviġagumavlugu nuliani. "
5640," and he is divided. An unmarried woman or a virgin is concerned about the things of the Lord, to be holy both in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the things of the world, how to please her husband. ","Tainnainniġman, iviġagniatagligik iluqaaktun Ataniġlu nulianiḷu.

5641," I am saying this for your benefit, not to place a limitation on you, but so that without distraction you may give notable and constant service to the Lord.","Uqautigivsi tamatkuniŋa ikayuqsaqłusi, suli iñuuniaġniq siġḷiġnaiqsaqługu ilivsiññun. Pitqugivsi sunik nalaunŋaruanik savautilluataquvlugu Ataniq pisuqtilaavsisun avigaaŋaŋaiġḷusi."
5642," If anyone thinks he is acting inappropriately toward his virgin, if she is past the bloom of youth and it seems necessary, he should do what he wishes; he does not sin. Let them marry. ","Iññuk piksrautigiiksinŋaruak katititchumaŋaiġumiŋ pisigilugu savaurriñiq Ataniġmik aasii aŋutim piḷḷuatapiaŋaiqpagu tuvaaqatiksrautini katitinŋaiḷġataqłutiŋ utuqqalisaiññaġmipkaġlugu suli ilaan pisuutini ilaanun suaŋavluni, katitillik.

5643," But the man who is firm in his commitment, and is under no necessity but has control over his will, and has decided in his own mind to keep his own virgin, does well. ","Aglaattauq aŋun sivunnipiaŋagumi katitinŋisaaġugluni nuliaksraunmiñun, isumaqaġumi katitinŋaisaallagugluni pisigilugu aŋalalluataqługu kipiġniuġutini nuliaksraunmiñun, katitinŋaisaaġumi piḷḷuataġmiuq.

5644," So then, the one who marries his own virgin does well, but the one who does not, does better.",Tavra taamna katitittuaq nuliaksrautigikkaġmiñun piḷḷuataqtuq aasii taamna katitinŋaitchuaq piḷḷuatałhaaġniaqtuq.
5645," A wife is bound as long as her husband is living. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes (only someone in the Lord). ","Nuliaguruaq pituummiruq uimiñun iñuuniqtutilaaŋatun uiñi. Uiguruaq tuqukpan, nuliaguruaq atanġitchuq tuvaaqasiutisukkumi kimik pisukkumi, aglaan uiñigluni ukpiqtuaguruamik. "

5647," With regard to food sacrificed to idols, we know that “we all have knowledge.” Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up. ","Paŋmapak tuyuġivsi sivuniġivlugu tuyuutivsiññi apiqsruutiksi, niġiñikun niqinik ilaaguaqtauŋaruanik iñuuraqpaŋnun.

5648," If someone thinks he knows something, he does not yet know to the degree that he needs to know. ","Kiñaliqaa isumaqaġumi iḷisimasiñasugalugu sunapayaaq, iḷisimanaqtisiññaġaa nalutilaani. "
5649," But if someone loves God, he is known by God.","Aglaan iñuum piviuttaġikpauŋ God, ilaa iḷisimammigaa God-im inmiñun pigitilaaŋanik."
5650," With regard then to eating food sacrificed to idols, we know that “an idol in this world is nothing,” and that “there is no God but one.” ","Aasiuvva niġiñikun niqimik ilaaguaqtauŋaruamik iñuuraqpaŋnun, iḷisimarugut iñuuraqpak uumaŋitchuq, suli allamik God-aitchuq aglaan God atausiuruq. "
5651," If after all there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), ","Iñuich unnii isumagaluaqpata iñugiakkasugalugich god-it qiḷaŋmiḷu nunamiḷu, aasii taiḷugich god-inik ataniġniglu, "
5652," yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we live, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we live.","uvagulli iḷisimarugut atausisualuŋmik God-mik Aapamik, savaŋaruamik supayaanik, suli ilaa pisivlugu iñuurugut.

5653," But this knowledge is not shared by all. And some, by being accustomed to idols in former times, eat this food as an idol sacrifice, and their conscience, because it is weak, is defiled. ","Taamnaaglaan ukpiqtuat iḷaŋisa nalugaat.

5654, Now food will not bring us close to God. We are no worse if we do not eat and no better if we do. ,"Niqim nalaunŋasipkaġniaŋitkaatigut sivuġaani God-im. Niġigupta piḷuksiḷaaġniaŋitchugut, suli niġiŋitkaluaġupta nalaunŋasiḷaaġniaŋiñmiugut. "
5655, But be careful that this liberty of yours does not become a hindrance to the weak. ,"Qaunakłaaġlusiaglaan. Irrusiqaġaluaġuvsi niġiḷḷalusi tainnatchiñik niqinik, niġġiñasi, tutqiisaaġniaġuvsiuŋ aniqan ukpiġutaani suaŋaił̣haaqtuaq ilivsi ukpiġutivsiññiñ. "
5656," For if someone weak sees you who possess knowledge dining in an idol’s temple, will not his conscience be “strengthened” to eat food offered to idols? ","Qanuq kialiqaa suaŋaił̣ł̣uni ukpiqtuaguruam tautukkumisi niġipkaqtillusi iñuuraqpaum aŋaiyyuviani, ilivsi iḷisimaruasii iñuuraqpaich uumaŋisilaaŋannik, qapiŋaisaaqtauviaqtuq niġiyumiñaqsiḷuni niqimik ilaaguaqtauruamik iñuuraqpaŋnun.

5657," So by your knowledge the weak brother or sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed. ","ilaa piḷuksipkaqtauniaqtuq ilivich niġiñipkun.

5659," For this reason, if food causes my brother or sister to sin, I will never eat meat again, so that I may not cause one of them to sin.","Taamna tainnainniġman niqi patchisaukpan aniqanma piḷuksiñiksraŋanun, suuramikunnii niqituġniaŋitchuŋa patchisausuŋiḷḷuŋa aniqanma piḷuksiñiksraŋanun."
5660, Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord? ,"Nalupqinaitchuamik ukpiqtuaguruŋa atanġiqsitauŋaruaq.

5662, This is my defense to those who examine me. ,Taavrumiŋa kiggutiqaġuuruŋa iñuŋnun arguasuguuruanun Ataniġmun tiliŋatilaamnik. 
5663, Do we not have the right to financial support? ,Nalaunŋaruq allatuttauq iñuktitun pamataugupta. 
5664," Do we not have the right to the company of a believing wife, like the other apostles and the Lord’s brothers and Cephas? ","Nalaunŋammiuq uvaptiŋnun tuvaaqasiqpatigut nuliaguruam iglauraġikapta, tainnatuttauq allatitun tilirauruatun, Ataniptalu aniqatiŋisun, Cephas-tullu. "
5665, Or do only Barnabas and I lack the right not to work? ,"Kisimñuk Barnabas-lu uvaŋalu savaktuiññaġlunuk iñuggutiqaqtuksrauviñuk, pamatchiugaqtillusi allanik iñuŋnik? Tainna piraksraġiŋitkiptiguk. "
5666, Who ever serves in the army at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Who tends a flock and does not consume its milk? ,Iñupayaaq akiḷiiḷaitchuq aŋuyaktiġuqsaqami.

5668," For it is written in the law of Moses, “Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain.” God is not concerned here about oxen, is he? ","Pitqurani aitchuutauŋaruani Moses-mun aglausimaruq inna, “Sigguġutituġniaŋitkiñ qimukti tunmaqtuaq palauvaksranun amiġaiyaivḷuni palauvaksranik.” Isumavisi God isumaaluuttaqaġasugalugu qimuktinik kisianik tainna uqallakami? "
5669," Or is he not surely speaking for our benefit? It was written for us, because the one plowing and threshing ought to work in hope of enjoying the harvest. ","Naumi.

5670," If we sowed spiritual blessings among you, is it too much to reap material things from you? ","Uvagut alġaqsruiŋakapta tusaayugaaġiksuanik ilivsiññun aasii ilivsi ukpiqtuaġuqłusi, pamataksrauŋitpisa?"

5673," Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple eat food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar receive a part of the offerings? ",Tainnatuttauq Ataniq pitqurriiŋaruq tamatkua alġaqsruiruat tusaayugaaġiksuanik akiññaktuksrauvlugich tamatkunaŋŋa akuqtuiruaniñ tusaayugaaġiksuamik.
5674, In the same way the Lord commanded those who proclaim the gospel to receive their living by the gospel. ,"Aglaan uvaŋa atuŋaitkiga nalliat-unnii tamatkua nalaunŋaruakun pamarrusiaqautiksrat, naaggaunnii ukuniŋa tuyuŋitchuŋa piññaksaġluŋa tainnatchimik pamarrusiaksramik.

5675," But I have not used any of these rights. And I am not writing these things so that something will be done for me. In fact, it would be better for me to die than – no one will deprive me of my reason for boasting! ","Piraksriusiaqaqłuŋa alġaqsruutigitquvlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq, kamasaaġutigiyumiñaitkiga alġaqsruiñiq. Alġaqsruiŋitkaluaġuma isumaapiaġataġniaqtuŋa. "
5676," For if I preach the gospel, I have no reason for boasting, because I am compelled to do this. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! ","Alġaqsruisuksiññaġluŋa alġaqsruiguma akiḷiusiaqaġniaġaluaqtuŋa. Aglaan uvaŋa alġaqsruiŋitchuŋa pisuksiññaġluŋa, aglaan alġaqsruiruŋa God-im aitchuŋavluŋa savaaksrapiaġatamik. "

5687," Instead I subdue my body and make it my slave, so that after preaching to others I myself will not be disqualified.",

And God is faithful: He will not let you be tried beyond what you are able to bear, but with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it.","Qanupayaaq ikł̣igutchaktinniaqtauguvich, tainnatchikuttauq iluqaġmiŋ iñuich ikł̣igutchaktinniaqtauŋammiut. Aglaan God ukpiġnapiaqtuq, ikł̣igutchaktinniaqtaupkaġniaŋitkaatin qaaŋiġḷugu manimmiyumiñakkan. Ikł̣igutchaktinniaqtauguvich, ilaan akimmasiġñiaġaatin akimayumiñaqsiḷutin."
5701," So then, my dear friends, flee from idolatry. ","Taamna tainnainman, uvaŋa piviuttaġivlusi aniqatiitkaa, ukpiqtuksrauŋipiaqtusi sunun God-auŋitchuanun. "
5702, I am speaking to thoughtful people. Consider what I say. ,Uqautigivsi isumaturuatun iñuktun iḷivḷusi. Isivġiqsigik ilivsiññik uqaluŋma iḷumun itilaaŋat. 
5703, Is not the cup of blessing that we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ? Is not the bread that we break a sharing in the body of Christ? ,"Atanġum nullautchiġvianik pikapta, suli imiqłuta qallugauramiñ quyyatigiŋakkaptiŋniñ ilaanun, iluqata piqatigiiksinmatun pisuurugut, iḷaŋiutiniġmi anniqsuusianun Christ maqipkaqtauŋaruamiñ auŋaniñ. Suli niġikaptigu punniq atautchimiiłłuta, iḷaŋiutimmatun pisuummiugut anniqsuusianiñ piruaniñ Christ timaaniñ tuqutauŋaruamiñ uvagut pisivluta. "
5704," Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all share the one bread. ","Aasii pisigivlugu iluqata niġiñiqput atautchimiñ punniġmiñ, uvagut atausiŋŋuqtitaurugut atautchisun timitun. "
5705, Look at the people of Israel. Are not those who eat the sacrifices partners in the altar? ,"Uuktuutigilugu una, isummatigisigik Jew-guruat piḷġusiŋich. Tamatkua niġisuuruat niġrutinik aitchuutauŋaruanik ikipkaiviŋmi piqasiutisuurut God-mun. "
5706, Am I saying that idols or food sacrificed to them amount to anything? ,"Uvva iḷisautiniḷukkivsi tamatkua niqit aitchuutauruat iñuuraqpaŋnun suuŋitchut, iñuuraqpaitchauq suuŋiñmatun. "
5707," No, I mean that what the pagans sacrifice is to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be partners with demons. ","Sivuniġigiga ukpiŋaitchuat aitchuikamiŋ ikipkautinik iñuuraqpaŋnun, aitchuirut ilitqusiqł̣uŋnun God-mun pigaluaġnatiŋ. Piqasiqsuutitquŋitkivsi ilitqusiqł̣uŋnun. "
5708, You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot take part in the table of the Lord and the table of demons. ,Imiġniaŋitkisi tapillugik qallugauraŋalu Atanġum qallugauraŋallu ilitqusiqł̣uich. Iḷaŋiutiyumiñaiñmiusi Atanġum niġġiviŋiññiñ iḷaŋiutilusiḷu niġġiviŋiññiñ ilitqusiqł̣uich. 
5709, Or are we trying to provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we really stronger than he is?,"Ataniġmun qinnautipkaġniaŋaiqsa, qanuq iḷisimarusi suaŋałhaaŋitchugut ilaaniñ."
5710," “Everything is lawful,” but not everything is beneficial. “Everything is lawful,” but not everything builds others up. ","Supayaat piñaiḷauŋitchut, tainna uqaġuurusi. Aakkaluaq, aglaan iḷaŋich ikayuutaulaitchut iñuum ukpiġutaanun. Supayaat piñaiḷauŋiññigisi, aglaan iḷaŋich suli qapiŋaisaaġutauŋitchut iñuum ukpiġutaanun. "
5711," Do not seek your own good, but the good of the other person. ","Piḷġutchiñi nalaunŋanasugalugich pisuukkavsiññi, anniqsuqsałhaaġlugich siḷallisi piraġutitchi, ilivsiññułhiñaq piŋaiġḷusi. "
5712," Eat anything that is sold in the marketplace without questions of conscience, ","Niġġisiuŋ sunapayaaq tunirauruaq niqipianik tuniuqqaiviŋmi salapqiiñiaŋaiġḷusi qanusipayaamik nalupqitchautiksramik isumami, "
5713, for the earth and its abundance are the Lord’s. ,"qanuq Bible-ni uqaluk aglausimaruq, “Nuna Atanġum pigigaa, suli sunapayaaq nunamiittuaq.” "
5714," If an unbeliever invites you to dinner and you want to go, eat whatever is served without asking questions of conscience. ","Iḷaŋata ukpiqtuaguŋitchuat aiyugaaqpasi niġiyaqtuqulusi aiyugaaqtauniġuvsi, niġġisiuŋ sunapayaaq inillaktauruaq sivuqqavsiññun salapqiiñiaŋaiġḷusi qanusipayaamik nalupqitchautiksramik isumami. "
5715," But if someone says to you, “This is from a sacrifice,” do not eat, because of the one who told you and because of conscience – ","Aglaan iñuum uqallautikpasi inna, Taamnauvva niqi ilaaguaqtauŋaruaq iñuuraqpaŋnun, tainnaqpasi niġġiñagu, pisigilugu taamna kiliksiruaq ilivsiññik, qanuq nalupqisukłuni isumamiñi nalaunŋatilaaŋanik niġiruni kilikkaasi. Iḷaanni apiqsriñiaġugnaġmiusi, summanmiuvva niġiḷḷaniġa aŋalanniaġmivauŋ iñuum allam? "
5716, I do not mean yours but the other person’s. For why is my freedom being judged by another’s conscience? ,"Niġiḷḷaanigniġuma supayaamik quyyatigiŋakkamnik God-mun, summan iñuich pasiñiaqpanŋa niqitigun niġikkapkun?"
5717," If I partake with thankfulness, why am I blamed for the food that I give thanks for? ","Innauvva ittuq. Niġiñiqsiḷu imiġniqsiḷu naagga sunapayaaq pikkaqsi, God-im nanġausiaqautigillaliuŋ. "
5718," So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God. ","Sumik piññasi piñaiḷutchiutauyumiñaqtuamik iñuich ukpiqtuaġuġniksraŋannun, Jew-gugaluaqpata, Greek-gugaluaqpata, naaggaunnii God-mun aŋaiyyuliqiruanun. "
5719," Do not give offense to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God, ","Piraġutitchiḷi uvaptun. Iviġagniḷułhaaġaġigitka iñupayaat supayaatigun pikkapkun. Uvamnun anniqsuġniałhaalaitchuŋa, aglaan allat annaurrautqugaluaqługich."
5720," just as I also try to please everyone in all things. I do not seek my own benefit, but the benefit of many, so that they may be saved. ",
5721," Be imitators of me, just as I also am of Christ.",Piḷġusiqaġitchi uvaptun tuvraiñiaġmatun Christ-mik. 
5722, I praise you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as I passed them on to you. ,"Nanġaġivsi pisigivlugu itqaumaniqsi, tuvraiñiqsiḷu iḷisaurrutigiŋakkamnik ilivsiññun. "
5723," But I want you to know that Christ is the head of every man, and the man is the head of a woman, and God is the head of Christ. ","Aglaan kaŋiqsitqugivsi Christ-gum qaukłiutilaaŋanik iñupayaamun, iñuum niaquġimmatun. Tainnatuttauq, uiguruaq niaquummatun inmiuq aġnamun, aasiisuli God niaquummatun Christ-mun. "
5724, Any man who prays or prophesies with his head covered disgraces his head. ,Kiñaliqaa aŋun aŋaiyyuruaq naagga uqaqtauruaq God-mun nasaqtuqłuni iḷisimanaqtinŋitkaa Christ qaukłiġitilaaŋanik inmiñun. 
5725," But any woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered disgraces her head, for it is one and the same thing as having a shaved head. ","Suli kiñaliqaa aġnaq aŋaiyyuruaq naagga uqaqtauruaq God-mun niaqquni matuiḷaaqługu iḷisimanaqtinŋitkaa uiñi qaukłiutilaaŋanik inmiñun. Inmiñik nalliummatinialaruq aŋunmiŋnun, nutchani iḷivḷugich kivraŋaruatun aŋutitun. "
5726," For if a woman will not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. But if it is disgraceful for a woman to have her hair cut off or her head shaved, she should cover her head. ","Aġnam matutuġniaŋitkumiuŋ niaqquni, saliraksraġigai nutchani aŋutitun. Aasii kanŋunaġniqpan aġnaq saliŋamman, matutuġliuŋ niaqquni. "
5727," For a man should not have his head covered, since he is the image and glory of God. But the woman is the glory of the man. ","Aŋutim matutugaksraġiŋitkaa niaqquni qanuq ilaa savaaguŋaruq irrusiatun God-im, aasii salapqiqsimavlugu God-im kamanautaa. Aġnavli salapqiagaa aŋutim kamanautaa. "
5728," For man did not come from woman, but woman from man. ",Aġnaġliasii savaaguŋaruq aŋunmiñ. Aŋun savaaguŋaitchuq aġnamiñ. 
5729," Neither was man created for the sake of woman, but woman for man. ","Aŋun savaaguŋaiñmiuq anniqsuqsaġlugu aġnaq, aglaan aġnaq savaaguŋaruq anniqsuqsaqługu aŋun. "
5730," For this reason a woman should have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels. ","Tavra aġnam matutuqtuksraġigaa niaqquni nalunaiñŋutaulugu ilaan qaukłiqaqtilaamiñun aŋunmik, isaġulgich iluqaġmiŋ tautuglugu suqpagiŋitchumagaat. "
5731," In any case, in the Lord woman is not independent of man, nor is man independent of woman. ","Aasiivsauq Atanġum sivunniuġutaani aŋutillu aġnallu anniqsuutigiiksuksrauniqsut avanmun, "
5732," For just as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But all things come from God. ","qanuq aġnaq savaaguŋagaluaqtillugu aŋunmiñ, aŋun paŋmapak animmiraqtuq aġnamiñ, tamarra supayaat qairut God-miñ."
5733, Judge for yourselves: Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? ,Nalaunŋatilaaqsiuŋ ilivsiññik. Aġnaq aŋaiyyugumi God-mun niaqquni matuiḷḷugu nalaunŋava? 
5734," Does not nature itself teach you that if a man has long hair, it is a disgrace for him, ",Ilivsi iḷisimarusi iḷisautiraksraitchusi aŋun nuyaqtusiruaq kanŋunaqtilaaŋanik. 
5735," but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering. ",Aglaan aġnam nuyaqtuniŋa qiñiyunaqsiḷġutauruq ilaanun. Qanuq nusaŋi aitchuutaurut ilaanun matugitquvlugich. 
5736," If anyone intends to quarrel about this, we have no other practice, nor do the churches of God.","Kiñapayaaq uqavaaġumakpan taavrumuuna, uvagut piksraitchugut allamik piḷġutchimik, naaggaunnii aŋaiyyuliqiruaŋi God-im."
5737," Now in giving the following instruction I do not praise you, because you come together not for the better but for the worse. ","Aglaan ukunuuna iḷisaurrutitigun nanġaŋitkivsi, qanuq katinnavsi atautchimun anniaġutiłhaaġuurusi nakuurualiqiniġmiñ. "
5738," For in the first place, when you come together as a church I hear there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it. ","Qanuq uvva aŋaiyyuliaqavsi inmikkuaŋasiñisuugaasi. Tainna kilgusiaqaŋaruŋa, aasii taamna ukpiġikavsakkiga. "
5739," For there must in fact be divisions among you, so that those of you who are approved may be evident. ","Qanuq inmikkuaŋasiraġaġniq ittuksrausugnaġniqsuq akunnavsiññi, tamatkua iḷumun ukpiqtuaguruat satqummiquvlugich. "
5740," Now when you come together at the same place, you are not really eating the Lord’s Supper. ","Katinnavsi atautchimun, Atanġum nullautchiġvianik niġiŋitchusi, "
5741," For when it is time to eat, everyone proceeds with his own supper. One is hungry and another becomes drunk. ","qanuq niġiñiġmi, iñullaa isagutiraqtuq ilaan niqaunmiñik, allali iñuk kaaktillugu allasuli imiŋasivḷuni. "
5742, Do you not have houses so that you can eat and drink? Or are you trying to show contempt for the church of God by shaming those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this!,"Suvisi? Aimaaġviqaqtusi niġġiviksranik imiġviksraniglu. Suuŋiḷaġigisi aŋaiyyuliqiruaŋi God-im tutqiisaaqługich tamatkua piksraitchuat. Qanuq uqallagniaqpik ilivsiññun? Nanġaġniaqpisi taavrumuuna? Naagga, nanġaġniaŋitkivsi."
5743," For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night in which he was betrayed took bread, ","Qanuq Atanġum salapqiŋagaa uvamnun iḷisaurrutigiŋakkaġa ilivsiññun una. Taivrumani unnuami aitchuutausaġviŋmiñi, Atanġum Jesus tiguŋagaa punniq, "
5744," and after he had given thanks he broke it and said, “This is my body, which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.” ","aasii quyyatigiqqaaqługu God-mun, ilaan avguŋagaa aasii uqallakłuni, Tavra taamna ittuq timiptun aitchuutigikkaptun tuqqutivlusi. Tainna pisiuŋ itqautigilugu uvamnun. "
5745," In the same way, he also took the cup after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, every time you drink it, in remembrance of me.” ","Tainnatun suli ilaan tiguŋagaa qallugauraq wine-mik imalik nullautchianikamiŋ, uqallakłuni, Una wine qallugauramiittuaq ittuq uvaŋa auptun maqipkaqtauyumaaqtuatun, God nutauruakun sivunniuġurriyumiñaqsiḷugu iñuŋnik tuqqutipkun. Imiġuvsiuŋ piyumagiksi itqautigilugu uvamnun qanutun akulaisigilugu imiġaluaġuvsiuŋ. "
5746," For every time you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.","Tavra qanutun akulaisigilugu niġiguvsiuŋ punniq imiġlusiḷu qallugauramiñ, taavrumuuna maniuġiksi Atanġum tuqqutaa qaitqigñiŋanun aglaan."
5747," For this reason, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. ","Tainnainman taamna, kiñaliqaa niġiruaq punniġmik imiqtuaġlu Atanġum qallugauraŋaniñ nalliummatiŋitchuakun piḷġutchikun, pasirauyumiñaqtuq qutchiksuakun isumakkutigiŋiññiḷugu Atanġum tuqqutaa. "
5748," A person should examine himself first, and in this way let him eat the bread and drink of the cup. ","Taamna pisigilugu iñuk qanuqitilaaqqaaqtuksraupiaqtuq inmiñun, aasii niġiḷuni punniġmik imiġluniḷu qallugauramiñ. "
5749, For the one who eats and drinks without careful regard for the body eats and drinks judgment against himself. ,Qanuq kiñaliqaa niġiruaq imiqtuaġlu itqaumagiŋiḷḷaan sivuniŋa Atanġum tuqqutaata tatavsausiaksriuqtuq inmiñun. 
5750," That is why many of you are weak and sick, and quite a few are dead. ","Tainnauvva piŋavlutiŋ iñugiaktuat iḷasi sayaitchut, naŋittuagurullu, suli iḷasi tuquvlutiŋ. "
5751," But if we examined ourselves, we would not be judged. ","Qanuqitilaaġuugupta uvaptiŋnun nalaunŋaruakun, Atanġum ilaan qanuqitilaaġayaitkaatigut. "
5752," But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned with the world. ","Tavra Atanġum ilaan qanuqitilaaġmatigut aasii paqitaġivluta pasiraksrauvluta, ilaan tatavsaġayukkaatigut, uvagut suksraunġiqsauqatautquŋił̣ł̣uta isuitchuamun piqatigilugich nunam iñuŋi."
5753," So then, my brothers and sisters, when you come together to eat, wait for one another. ","Aniqatiitkaa, taamna tainnainman, utaqqisillaayumausi qakuguliqaa katitkuvsi atautchimun niġisuglusi Atanġum nullautchiġvianik. "
5754," If anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, so that when you assemble it does not lead to judgment. I will give directions about other matters when I come.","Kiñaliqaa kaakkumi niġisuiqsaaġli aimmiḷuni. Qanuq niġiqatigiikavsi atautchimi, aullasivsi iḷaanni tatavsausiaqaqtitpiaġaasi. Allatigun sutigun piraksriġñiaġivsi qaiguma."
5755," With regard to spiritual gifts, brothers and sisters, I do not want you to be uninformed. ","Aniqatiit, tuyuġivsi paŋmapak apiqsruutisi sivuniġivlugich Ilitqusiġiksuam aitchuutiŋigun. Kaŋiqsimaqłuquŋitkivsi tamatkunuuna. "
5756," You know that when you were pagans you were often led astray by speechless idols, however you were led. ","Iḷisimarusi ukpiqtuaġuŋaiñŋavsi asiñuurrauŋarusi aŋaiyyusukłusi iñuuraqpaŋnun uqalaiḷanun, aasii tainna pikavsi aŋalatiłłusi tamatkunuŋa iñuuraqpaŋnun. "
5757," So I want you to understand that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says, “Jesus is cursed,” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord,” except by the Holy Spirit.","Paŋmapak-aasii kaŋiqsitqugivsi taamna kiñaliqaa aŋalatittuaq Ilitqusiġiksuamun uqallakkumiñaipiaqtuq inna, Jesus suksraunġiqsauli. Suli kiñaliqaa uqallakkumiñaiñmiuq iḷumutun inna, Jesus Atanġuruq, Ilitqusiġiksuam pipkaŋisuaqpani."
5758," Now there are different gifts, but the same Spirit. ","God-im aitchuġaatigut iñugiaktuanik allakaaġiiñik ikayuqtiksraptiŋnik savautiguptiŋni, aglaan atautchim atiruam Ilitqusiġiksuam pigipkaġai iluqaisa uvaptiŋnun. "
5759," And there are different ministries, but the same Lord. ","Allakaaġiiksuat savaaksrat God-mun ittut, aglaan iluqata savautigikput atausiq Ataniq. "
5760," And there are different results, but the same God who produces all of them in everyone. ","Suli allakaaġiiksuat savaurriñġich inmiut savaaqaqtuni God-im savaaŋiñik, aglaan atausiuruam God-im iluqata savaktitkaatigut savaamiñik. "
5761, To each person the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the benefit of all. ,"Ilitqusiġiksuam iḷitchuġipkaġuugaa God-im suaŋŋataa atausiullaavluta uvaptigun, anniqsuqsaqługich aŋaiyyuliqiruat iluqaisa. "
5762," For one person is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, and another the message of knowledge according to the same Spirit, ","Ilitqusiġiksuam uqaqtillagaa iñuk isumattutikun, allasuli iñuk uqaqtillavlugu iḷisimmatiqaqtiłługu atausiuruam Ilitqusiġiksuam. "
5763," to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, ","Atausiuruam Ilitqusiġiksuam allaptauq iñuk suaŋalluktuamik ukpiġutiqaqtillagaa, suli alla aitchuusiaqaqtillavlugu iłuaqsiriñiġmik atausiuruam Ilitqusiġiksuam. "
5764," to another performance of miracles, to another prophecy, and to another discernment of spirits, to another different kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. ","Suli Ilitqusiġiksuam allaptauq savaktillavlugu aliuġnaqtuanik, aasiisuli alla iñuk uqaqtaullavlugu God-mun, allasuli iñuk puttuqsrisiqaqtillavlugu nalliaŋnun Ilitqusiġiksuamullu naagga iḷumun ilitqusiuŋitchuamullu iñuk aŋalatilaaŋanik, allasuli uqaqtillavlugu iñugiaktuanik uqautchiñik naluraŋiñik, aasiisuli sut uqautigikkaŋi, allamun iñuŋmun mumiksillavlugich nalugaluaġmiruamun taavrumiŋa uqautchimik. "
5765," It is one and the same Spirit, distributing as he decides to each person, who produces all these things.","Iluqaġmiŋ tamatkua ikayuusiat aitchuutaurut uvaptiŋnun atiruamiñ Ilitqusiġiksuamiñ atausisualuuruamiñ, aasii autaaqługich atausiullaavluta uvaptiŋnun, aitchuutit isummatigikkani pigiraksraġivlugich uvaptiŋnun."
5766," For just as the body is one and yet has many members, and all the members of the body – though many – are one body, so too is Christ. ","Qanuq timitun atausiuruatun aasii iñugiaktuanik sulliñiqaqłuni, suli iluqaġmiŋ iḷaŋi timim iñugiakkaluaqtillugich atausiuvluni timi, tainnatuttauq atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagikput Christ, "
5767," For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body. Whether Jews or Greeks or slaves or free, we were all made to drink of the one Spirit. ","qanuq atausiullaavluta iḷaummatun ittugut Christ timaanun. Ilitqusiġiksuam atausiuruam iluqata atausiŋŋuŋagaatigut, atautchisun timitun, paptaiġutikun Jew-gugaluaġupta naagga Jew-guŋitkaluaġupta, kivgaugaluaġupta naagga kivgauŋitkaluaġupta. Aasii atausiuruaq Ilitqusiġiksuaq aitchuutauruq atausiullaavluta uvaptiŋnun."
5768," For in fact the body is not a single member, but many. ",Timi sulliñiqaqtuq iñugiaktuanik. Atausił̣hiñauluni sulliñiġuŋitchuq. 
5769," If the foot says, “Since I am not a hand, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. ","Isigaich uqallakkumiñaqpata inna, Uvaŋa argauŋił̣ł̣uŋa timim sulliñiġiŋitkaaŋa. Taavruma uqallautim iḷauŋaipayaaġumiñaitkaa timimun. "
5770," And if the ear says, “Since I am not an eye, I am not part of the body,” it does not lose its membership in the body because of that. ","Suli siun uqallallakpan, Qanuq irauŋił̣ł̣uŋa sulliñiġiŋitkaaŋa timim. Taavruma uqallautim iḷauŋaipayaaġumiñaiñmigaa timimun. "
5771," If the whole body were an eye, what part would do the hearing? If the whole were an ear, what part would exercise the sense of smell? ","Timi iluqani iraukpan, iñuk tusaallayumiñaitchuq. Timi-suli iluqani siutaukpan, iñuk naiḷaiññayaġmiuq. "
5772," But as a matter of fact, God has placed each of the members in the body just as he decided. ","Aglaan God-im tainna savaŋaitkaatigut. God-im savaŋagai timivut iñugiaktuanik sulliñiqaqługich, aasii ilaisigullaa inillakługich timim sulliñillaaŋa sumun pisukamiuŋ. "
5773," If they were all the same member, where would the body be? ",Timi iluqani atausił̣hiñauluni sulliñiġugaluaqpan timaunayaitchuq. 
5774," So now there are many members, but one body. ","Aglaan God-im savausiatun timimik, iñuk timiqaqtuq atautchimik sulliñiqaqtuamik iñugiaktuanik."
5775," The eye cannot say to the hand, “I do not need you,” nor in turn can the head say to the foot, “I do not need you.” ","Iri uqallakkumiñaitchuq argaŋnun, Anniqsuutigiŋitkikpiñ, naaggaunnii niaquq isigaŋnun, Anniqsuutigiŋitkikpiñ. "
5776," On the contrary, those members that seem to be weaker are essential, ","Aglaan uvva, iḷaŋi timim qiññaqaqtuat anniqsuutauvigruaŋitchuatun piitchuipiaqtut. "
5777," and those members we consider less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our unpresentable members are clothed with dignity, ",Aasiisuli tamatkua timim sulliñiŋi qiñiyunapiaŋitchuat isummatigilluataġuummigivut qanuq piitchuiñmiut. Suli sulliñiŋi timim kanŋugiravut taalutaqaġivut. 
5778," but our presentable members do not need this. Instead, God has blended together the body, giving greater honor to the lesser member, ","Qaunagilluatałhaaġivut tamatkunaŋŋa timim sulliñiŋiñiñ kanŋugiŋisaptiŋniñ. God-im savaŋagai timivut, uvaptiŋnun qaunagilluatałhaaquvlugich timim iḷaŋi isummatigikkavut anniqsuutaupiaŋiññasugalugich. "
5779," so that there may be no division in the body, but the members may have mutual concern for one another. ","Tainna God-im sivuniqaŋagaa timi itquvlugu, sulliñipayauraŋi timipta atautchisun itquvlugich, qaunagilluataquvlugich iluqaisa atunim. Tainnatun God sivuniqaŋaruq iluqaisa ukpiqtuat iñuuniaqatigiiquvlugich atilutiŋ. "
5780," If one member suffers, everyone suffers with it. If a member is honored, all rejoice with it.","Atausiq iḷauruaq isumaaluusiqpan, iluqaġmiŋ iḷauruat isumaaluutigigaat, naagga atausiq iḷauruaq isumakkusiaqaġluataqpan, iluqaġmiŋ quviatchaktaurut."
5781," Now you are Christ’s body, and each of you is a member of it. ","Iluqavsi atausiurusi, iñullaaguvlusi sulliñiġimmatun Christ timaata itkaasi. "
5782," And God has placed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, gifts of healing, helps, gifts of leadership, different kinds of tongues. ","Aasii aŋaiyyuliqiruat akunġanni God piksraŋaruq sivulliġivlugu, iñuich tilirauvlugich alġaqsruitquvlugich, igḷuani uqaqtiksranik God-mun, piŋayuagni iḷisaurriksranik, maanna aliuġnaqtuanik savallaruanik, tamatkuniŋalu iłuaqsiriḷḷaruanik, ikayuiruksraniglu, ataniġnaqutiqaqtuallu, uqallaruallu allakaaġiiñik uqautchiñik naluramiŋnik.

5786,And now I will show you a way that is beyond comparison.,
5787," If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but I do not have love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. ","Aitchuusiaqaġaluaġniġuma uqallaniġmik allagiiñik uqautchiñik nalukkamnik, uqallaluŋa allatun iñuktitun isaġuliktullu, aasii piviuttaqqutaiḷḷuŋa allanun iñuŋnun, uqaġniġa arriqaqtuq qukiġñaqsivḷugu kausugrukkaŋatitun savił̣hatun. "
5788," And if I have prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith so that I can remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. ","Suli aitchuusiaqaġmiguma uqaqtauniġmik God-mun, kaŋiqsiḷḷalugich iluqaisa sivuani kaŋiqsiḷaisaŋich iñuich iḷisimaluŋa supayaanik, naaggaqaa suaŋapiaġataqtuamik ukpiġutiqaġaluaġuma nuktallalugich iġġich aasii piviuttaqqutaiḷḷuŋa iñuŋnun, anniqsuutauŋitchuŋa. "
5789," If I give away everything I own, and if I give over my body in order to boast, but do not have love, I receive no benefit.","Aitchuutigigaluaġmigupkich supayaurat pigikkatka iḷiappauruanun iñuŋnun, naaggaqaa timiga ikipkaqtitkaluaġupku pisigilugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq, aasii piviuttaqsriŋiḷḷuŋa iñuŋnik, akiḷiusiaksraitchuŋa."
5790," Love is patient, love is kind, it is not envious. Love does not brag, it is not puffed up. ",Iñuk piviuttaqsriruaq iñuŋnik allanik qanułłayaitchuq taluġnaitchuġlu killuqsrautaitchuġlu uqavigaaġurriḷaitchuġlu.

5792," It is not glad about injustice, but rejoices in the truth. ","Iñuk piviuttaqsriruaq allanik iñuŋnik suuramikunnii quviasulaitchuq iñuich piḷuktualiqimmata, aglaan quviasuguuruq iñuich nalaunŋarualiqimmata. "
5793," It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.","Iñuum piviuttaqsriruam allanik iñuŋnik manimmiḷḷagai pimaqłuutiŋich allat, ataramik ukpiġivlugu nakuuniqsraq iñuktigun, ataramik ququutivlugich pigigñiqsranik allat iñuich, suli manimmiḷgutiqaqtuiññaqłuni allanun iñuŋnun."
5794," Love never ends. But if there are prophecies, they will be set aside; if there are tongues, they will cease; if there is knowledge, it will be set aside. ","Piviuttaqqun inniaqtuq isuitchuamun.

"
5795," For we know in part, and we prophesy in part, ","Qanuq iḷitchiŋaniqput paŋmapak naamaitchuq, suli uqaqtauniqput God-mun naamaiñmiuq, "
5796," but when what is perfect comes, the partial will be set aside. ","aglaan taimanigu naamasiraugupta qiḷaŋmi, pigiraksraġiŋaiġñiaġivut naamaitchuat aitchuusiat. "
5797," When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. But when I became an adult, I set aside childish ways. ","Taamna uuktuutiqaġumiñaqtuq uumiŋa.

5798," For now we see in a mirror indirectly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I have been fully known. ","Uvvasuli alla uuktuun taavrumuŋa. Paŋmapak uvva qiñiġmatun Christ pigikput taġġaktuutigipiaŋitchuakun, tauttuġluammatun pivḷugu. Aglaan taimanigu tautugniaġikput sukuiġḷugu.

5799," And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.","Tavra iñuich ukpiqsimaniaqtut suli, niġiugniaqtutsuli, piviuttaqsriḷutiglu suli, aglaan taapkunaŋŋa piŋasuni piviuttaqqutiqaġniq allanun anniqsuutaułhamaapiaqtuq."
5800," Pursue love and be eager for the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. ","Piviuttaqsriñiq allanik iñuŋnik kipiġniuġutigiłhaaqsiuŋ supayaamiñ. Aasiisuli kipiġniuġutigipiaġmiḷugich aitchuutiŋi Ilitqusiġiksuam, kipiġniuġutigiłhaaġlugu aitchuusiaqaġniq uqaqtauniġmik God-mun. "
5801," For the one speaking in a tongue does not speak to people but to God, for no one understands; he is speaking mysteries by the Spirit. ","Qanuq iñuk uqaqtuaq uqautchimik nalukkaġmiñik uqaqtuq God-mun, uqautiŋitkai iñuich, qanuq iñuum kialiqaa kaŋiqsiḷaitkaa, uqaqtiłługu Ilitqusiġiksuam kaŋiqsiñaitchuamik uqautchimik. "
5802," But the one who prophesies speaks to people for their strengthening, encouragement, and consolation. ","Aglaalli iñuk uqaqtauruaq God-mun kaŋiqsiñaqtuamik uqaqłuni suaŋasiḷaaġiruq iñuich ukpiġutiŋiññik, qapiŋaisaaqługiḷḷu suli arakługich. "
5803," The one who speaks in a tongue builds himself up, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. ","Iñuk uqaqtuaq kaŋiqsiñaitchuamik uqautchimik nalukkaġmiñik, suaŋasiḷaaqtuq inmiñun, aglaalli uqaqtauruam God-mun suaŋasiḷaaġai aŋaiyyuliqiruat."
5804," I wish you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you would prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets so that the church may be strengthened.","Tavra paŋmapak iluqasi uqaqugivsi allauruanik uqautchiñik.

"
5805," Now, brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I help you unless I speak to you with a revelation or with knowledge or prophecy or teaching? ","Aniqatiit, ullakkuvsi iḷaanni aasii uqaaqsiḷuŋa allauruanik uqautchiñik nalukkavsiññik, anniqsuġayaitkivsi.

"
5806," It is similar for lifeless things that make a sound, like a flute or harp. Unless they make a distinction in the notes, how can what is played on the flute or harp be understood? ","Uvva uuktuun. Iñuich atuqtuuraġniḷuŋmata atuqtuurayuiḷḷaġmiŋ suvluaqtuġnanik naagga nuqaqtiliŋnik atuqtuuranik, iñuich naalaġniruat iḷisaġiyumiñaitkaat iġiñaŋa atuutim. "
5807," If, for example, the trumpet makes an unclear sound, who will get ready for battle? ","Aasiisuli aŋuyaktim atuqtuuraŋa nivliqpan nalupqinaqtuamik nipimik, allat aŋuyaktit upisalakkumiñaitchut aŋuyaksaġlutiŋ. "
5808," It is the same for you. If you do not speak clearly with your tongue, how will anyone know what is being said? For you will be speaking into the air. ",Tainnainmiuq ilivsiññun uqaġuvsi kaŋiqsiñaitchuanik uqautchiñik iñuum kialiqaa kaŋiqsiyumiñaiñmigaasi. Siḷałhiñamun uqaġmatun piñiaqtusi. 
5809," There are probably many kinds of languages in the world, and none is without meaning. ","Nalupqinaitchuamik iñugiaktuat allakaaġiich uqautchich nunamiitkaluaqtut, aasii nalliat-unnii sivunġiñŋitchuq. "
5810," If then I do not know the meaning of a language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. ","Aglaan uvaŋa kaŋiqsiḷaitkupku iñuk uqaqtuaq uqayuiḷauniaqtuq uvamnun, suli taamna uvaŋaptauq ilaanun. "
5811," It is the same with you. Since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, seek to abound in order to strengthen the church.","Tainnatuttauq ilivsi. Kipiġniuqtuagukavsi piqaġumapiaqłusi Ilitqusiġiksuam aitchuutiŋiñik, apiqsrivigisiuŋ aitchuusiaqaġuglusi nakuuniqsrauruanik, tamatkuniŋa aitchuusianik anniqsuutauyumiñaqtuanik aŋaiyyuliqiruanun."
5812," So then, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. ",Tavra iñuk uqaqtuaq nalukkaġmigun uqausikun aŋaiyyuruksrauruq mumiḷḷasuglugu uqausiġikkani. 
5813," If I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unproductive. ","Qanuq aŋaiyyuguma nalukkapkun uqausikun, ilitqusiġa aŋaiyyugaluaqtuq aglaan kaŋiqsiŋitkiga qanuq uqaqtilaaġa. "
5814," What should I do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing praises with my spirit, but I will also sing praises with my mind. ","Tavraasii qanuġniaġniqpik? Aŋaiyyuniaqtuŋa uqautchikun nalukkapkun, suli aŋaiyyuniaġmiuŋa iḷisimakkapkun uqausikun. Atuġniaġmiuŋa iluqaakkun nalukkapkullu, iḷisimakkapkullu uqautchikkun. "
5815," Otherwise, if you are praising God with your spirit, how can someone without the gift say “Amen” to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying? ","Aŋaiyyuguvsi nanġaiguvsiḷu sivuġaanni aŋaiyyuruat kaŋiqsiñaitchuakun uqautchikun, tamatkua kaŋiqsiŋitchuat Amen-chumiñaitkaat aŋaiyyutiksi quyyan, qanuq nalurut sunik uqaqtilaavsiññik. "
5816," For you are certainly giving thanks well, but the other person is not strengthened. ","Ilivsi quyyavigilluataġugnaġaluaġiksi God, aglaan allat anniqsuusiaqaġniaŋitchut. "
5817," I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you, ",Quyyavigigiga God uqallakama uqautchiñik naluraiññik iñuich qaaŋiqł̣ugu iluqasi uqallaniqsi. 
5818," but in the church I want to speak five words with my mind to instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.","Aglaan itqataukama aŋaiyyuruani, uqaġummatiqałhaaqtuŋa tallimatualuŋnik uqaluŋnik kaŋiqsiñaqtuakun uqausipkun, 10,000-niñ uqaluŋniñ kaŋiqsiñaitchuakun uqaġniġmiñ."
5819," Brothers and sisters, do not be children in your thinking. Instead, be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature. ","Aniqatiit, miqłiqtutun kaŋiqsisiqaġnasi Ilitqusiġiksuam aitchuutiŋigun, aglaan irrusiqaġitchi iñuguaksraiŋaruatun. Aglaattauq, ittitchi miqłiqtuuratun kaŋiqsisivsiññi pigiitchuamik. "
5820," It is written in the law: “By people with strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people, yet not even in this way will they listen to me,” says the Lord. ","Bible-ni aglausimaruq Ataniq uqallaŋanivḷugu inna,"
5821," So then, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is not for unbelievers but for believers. ","Qanuq uqallausiġiniaqpisigu naigḷiḷugu taavruma sivuniŋa, Aniqatiit? Aŋaiyyuliaqavsi, iñuk atuġumiñaqtuq aŋaiyyunmik, allali iḷisaurriyumiñaqtuq, allasuli quliaqtuaġumiñaqtuq God-im satqummikkaŋanik inmiñun, allali uqaġumiñaqtuq kaŋiqsiñaitchuamik uqautchimik, naagga mumiksiyumiñaqtuq uqautauruamik. Sunapayaaq piḷi iñupayaat suaŋasiḷaaqtauyumiñaqsiḷugich ukpiġunmiŋni. "
5822," So if the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and unbelievers or uninformed people enter, will they not say that you have lost your minds? ","Kisulliqaa uqaqpata kaŋiqsiñaitchuamik uqautchimik, malġuulik iñugiagniqsrat pikpata piŋasutunnii apaigurut, suli aqulligiigḷutiŋ, aasii atausiq mumiksirauluni. "
5823," But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or uninformed person enters, he will be convicted by all, he will be called to account by all. ","Aglaan mumiksiriksraitpan, aŋaiyyuliaqavsi iluqaġmiŋ nipaisaaġlich uqaqsiññaġluni isumamiñi inmiñun God-mullu. "
5824," The secrets of his heart are disclosed, and in this way he will fall down with his face to the ground and worship God, declaring, “God is really among you.”","Malġuk iññuk naagga piŋasut God-im uqaqtiŋi uqaġlich, aasii allat nalaunŋatilaaġlugu uqautigikkaŋat. "
5825," What should you do then, brothers and sisters? When you come together, each one has a song, has a lesson, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all these things be done for the strengthening of the church. ","Allaptauq God-im uqaqtaa aquppiruaq tamaani qanimi aitchuusiaqaqpan puttuqsripkaunmik, sivulliq uqaqqaaqtuaq aġiuli. "
5826," If someone speaks in a tongue, it should be two, or at the most three, one after the other, and someone must interpret. ","Qanuq iluqasi uqaqtauyumiñaqtusi God-mun atausiullaalusi, iñuich iluqaisa iḷitchitqulugich suli iluqaisa qapiŋaisaaqtautqulugich. "
5827," But if there is no interpreter, he should be silent in the church. Let him speak to himself and to God. ","Iñuk uqaluksriusiaqaqtuaq God-miñ aŋalataġillaruq inmiñik, aasii utaqqiḷugu piviksrani, "
5828, Two or three prophets should speak and the others should evaluate what is said. ,"qanuq God pipkairuaguŋitchuq piallagniġmik aglaan atiugaġniġmik. Tamatkunatun ilaaguaqtauruatun God-mun allani inini aŋaiyyuliaqamiŋ piḷġusiatitun, "
5829," And if someone sitting down receives a revelation, the person who is speaking should conclude. ","tainnatuttauq aġnasi nipaisaaqtuksraummiut aŋaiyyuliaqavsi. Qanuq uqaqurauŋitchut, qaukłiuyummataitchuksraurut, pitqurat uqaluatitun. "
5830," For you can all prophesy one after another, so all can learn and be encouraged. ","Sumigliqaa kipiġniuttaqaġumiŋ iḷisimasuglutiŋ, kaŋiqsiuġlisigik tuvaaqatitiŋ aimaaġviŋmi, qanuq kanŋunaqtuq aġnam uqaġniksraŋa aŋaiyyuliaqavsi."
5831," Indeed, the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets, ","Iłuigivisiuŋ taamna? Iłuigiraksraġiŋitkiksi. God-im uqalua aguiñŋaitchuq ilivsiññiñ, suli kisivsisualuk anniqsuusiaġiŋitkiksi. "
5832, for God is not characterized by disorder but by peace.,"Kiñaliqaa isummatigigumi God-mun uqaqtiginiḷuni, naagga puttuqsrisiqaqtinniḷuni Ilitqusiġiksuamun, paaqsaaŋaniaŋitkai aglaatka ilivsiññun, God-mun pitquraġiniḷugich. "
5833,"As in all the churches of the saints, ","Aasii kiñaliqaa paaqsaaŋagumi, tainna kiikaa kaŋiqsisaiḷḷi. "
5834," the women should be silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak. Rather, let them be in submission, as in fact the law says. ","Tavra, aniqatiitka, kipiġniupiaġataġitchi uqaqtausugniġmun God-mun, suli pitchaiḷiñagu uqaġniq nalukkavsiññik uqautchiñik. "
5835," If they want to find out about something, they should ask their husbands at home, because it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in church. ",Aglaan supayaat pisigik suqpanaipiaqtuakun atiugaġnikullu.
5836," Did the word of God begin with you, or did it come to you alone?",
5837," If anyone considers himself a prophet or spiritual person, he should acknowledge that what I write to you is the Lord’s command. ",
5838," If someone does not recognize this, he is not recognized. ",
5839," So then, brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and do not forbid anyone from speaking in tongues. ",
5840, And do everything in a decent and orderly manner.,
5841," Now I want to make clear for you, brothers and sisters, the gospel that I preached to you, that you received and on which you stand, ","Aniqatiit, paŋmapak itqaqtitchukkivsi alġaqsruutigiŋakkamnik tusaayugaaġiksuamik ilivsiññun. Taimñauruq tusaayugaaġiksuaq taimani ukpiġiŋakkaqsi, aasiisuli ukpiġiŋaiŋaisaqsi paŋmapak. "
5842," and by which you are being saved, if you hold firmly to the message I preached to you – unless you believed in vain. ","Annaurrauyumaaqtusi ukpiġituiññaġuvsigik taapkua tusaayugaaġiksuat, aglaan annaurrauyumiñaiñmiusi iḷumun ukpiŋisuaġuvsi."
5843," For I passed on to you as of first importance what I also received – that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures, ","Alġaqsruiŋaruŋa ilivsiññun naumaniqsrauruanik iḷisaurrutinik aitchuusiaġiŋakkamnik, taamna Christ tuquŋanivḷugu piḷuutivut pisigivlugich, taŋŋiqł̣ugich Bible unniqsuqłiisigiŋakkaŋich taavruma sivusaaġruani. "
5844," and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day according to the scriptures, ","Suli alġaqsruutigiŋammigiga aitchuusiaġiŋakkaġa, Christ iḷuviqtauŋanivḷugu, aasii uvluk piŋayuaŋni aŋipkaqtauŋanivḷugu, taŋŋiqł̣ugich Bible unniqsuqłiisigiŋakkaŋich taavruma sivusaaġruani. "
5845," and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve. ","Aasii aŋianikami, Christ tautuktinŋaruq Cephas-mun, maanna qulit malġuŋnun iḷitchitquranun. "
5846," Then he appeared to more than five hundred of the brothers and sisters at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep. ","Tavra suli tautuktinŋammiuq iñugiałhaaqtuanun 500-miñ aniqatinun atautchimiitillugich, iñugiagniqsraŋich iñuurut, iḷaŋich siñiksaaniŋagaluaqtut tuqqunmi. "
5847," Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. ","Tautuktinŋammiuq suli James-mun, maanna iluqaiññun tiliraŋiñun God-im. "
5848," Last of all, as though to one born at the wrong time, he appeared to me also. ","Aqulliannun tamatkua, tautuktinŋammiuq uvamnun, tilirauruamun alġaqsruitquvluŋa aqusaaġruatigun allat tilirauruat. "
5849," For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. ","Kamanaiññiqsrauruŋa tilirauruaniñ, nalliummatiŋitchuŋaunnii tairauniġmun tilirauruamik qanuq nagliksaaqtinŋavlugich aŋaiyyuliqiruat God-mun. "
5850," But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace to me has not been in vain. In fact, I worked harder than all of them – yet not I, but the grace of God with me. ","Aglaan paŋmapak irrusiġa irrusiġigiga ikayuutaagun God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋan. Ilaan nagliktuutiqpaŋa uvamnun asiḷiqqutauŋaitchuq.

5851," Whether then it was I or they, this is the way we preach and this is the way you believed.",Nallivut uvaŋalu iliŋiḷḷu alġaqsruigaluaġupta ilivsi ukpiliŋarusi.
5852," Now if Christ is being preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say there is no resurrection of the dead? ","Paŋmapak Christ alġaqsruutauruq aŋipkaqtauŋanivḷugu tuqqunmiñ, summan iḷasi uqalliavat aŋŋisaiññivḷugich tuquŋaruat? "
5853," But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. ","Aŋŋisaiññiqpata tuquruat, Christ aŋipkaqtauŋaiñmiñiqsuq. "
5854," And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is futile and your faith is empty. ","Christ aŋipkaqtauŋaitpan, alġaqsruiñiqput taŋiġitchuq, suli ukpiġurri taŋiġiñmiuq. "
5855," Also, we are found to be false witnesses about God, because we have testified against God that he raised Christ from the dead, when in reality he did not raise him, if indeed the dead are not raised. ","Qanuq iḷumun itpan uqausiġikkaqsi tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtauniaŋiññivḷugich, God-im aŋipkaŋaiñmiñiġaa Christ. Taamna iḷumun itpan, saglutiginiġikput God, qanuq alġaqsruirugut God-mun aŋipkapiaŋanivḷugu Christ tuqqunmiñ. "
5856," For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ has been raised. ","Tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtauŋitpata, Christ aŋipkaqtauŋaisimammiuq. "
5857," And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is useless; you are still in your sins. ","Christ aŋipkaqtauŋaisimakpan, ukpiġurri anniqsuutauŋitchuq, suli suksraunġiqsauyumaaqtusi suli piḷuutisi pisigilugich. "
5858," Furthermore, those who have fallen asleep in Christ have also perished. ",Aasiisuli tamatkua ukpiqtuaguvlutiŋ siñiksaŋaruat tuqqunmi suksrauniqsut. 
5859," For if only in this life we have hope in Christ, we should be pitied more than anyone.","Ukpiġutipta Christ-mun anniqsuqsimakpatigut paŋmapatualuk iñuuniptiŋni, naglignałhamaaqtugut iñupayauraniñ allaniñ."
5860," But now Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. ","Aglaan ami Christ aŋipkaqtaupiaŋaruq tuqqunmiñ, Ilaa aŋipkaqtauqqaaŋaruq, aasii aquvatigun iluqaġmiŋ siñiksaŋaruat tainnatun aŋipkaqtauniaġmiut. "
5861," For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man. ","Tavra iñuum atautchim iñuich tuqqusiqsinmagich, allavlivsauq iñuum tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtitaullasigai. "
5862," For just as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive. ","Qanuq iluqaġmiŋ Adam kiŋuniŋi tuquruksraurut, aglaan iluqaġmiŋ atausiŋŋuqatauruat Christ-mun iñuggusiqsauniaqtut. "
5863," But each in his own order: Christ, the firstfruits; then when Christ comes, those who belong to him. ","Aglaan nalaunŋaruakun piviksrallaamikkun, Christ aŋiqqaaŋaruq, aasii qaitqikpan, tamatkuali pigikkaŋi Christ. "
5864," Then comes the end, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father, when he has brought to an end all rule and all authority and power. ","Taamna pianikpan, Christ qaiññiaġaa God-mun supayaanun atanniqsimmatini, akiiḷianiqqaaġlugu atanniqsimmatipayauraq suaŋŋatipayauraġlu, iñuŋniitkaluaqpan ilitqusiqł̣uŋniitkaluaqpallu. "
5865, For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet. ,Christ umialguniaqtuq-suli akiiḷiḷġataġlugich iluqaisa uumigirini. 
5866, The last enemy to be eliminated is death. ,Aqulliq uumigiri akiiḷirauniaqtuaq tuqqun. 
5867," For he has put everything in subjection under his feet. But when it says “everything” has been put in subjection, it is clear that this does not include the one who put everything in subjection to him. ","“Qanuq God-im aitchuŋagaa suaŋŋanmik atanniqsimatquvlugich suaŋŋatipayaurat.” Tainna aglausimaruq Bible-ni. Taapkua uqaluich uqallautikamisigut, “Ilaan atanniqsimaniaġai suaŋŋatipayaurat,” sivuniqaqtuq Christ-mun atanniqsimayumiñaiññivḷugu God, aitchuiruaq inmiñun atanniqsimmatiksraŋanik suaŋŋanmik. "
5868," And when all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will be subjected to the one who subjected everything to him, so that God may be all in all.","Christ payarianikkumigich suaŋŋatipayaurat, ilaaptauq God-im Iġñiŋa atanniqsimapkaġniaġmiuq God-mun, suaŋŋatiksriññiŋaruamun inmiñun, God kamanaġniqsrautqulugu supayaaniñ."
5869," Otherwise, what will those do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, then why are they baptized for them? ","Tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtaulaipiaqpata, summan iñuich iḷaŋich paptaiqsausuuvat pisivlugich tuquŋaruat? Aŋŋisaitpan, anniqsuusiaksraitchuq kiñaliqaa iñuk paptaiqsaugaluaqtuaq pisivlugu tuquŋaruaq. "
5870, Why too are we in danger every hour? ,"Aŋŋisaitpan, ataramik anayanniuqtinnayaitkiga iñuggutiga. "
5871," Every day I am in danger of death! This is as sure as my boasting in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord. ","Qanuq uvlutuaq satqumiruŋa tuqqunmun. Taamna nalupqinaipiaqtuq aniqatiit, nalupqinaisigimmatuttauq quviasuutiqaqtilaaġa pisigivlugu ukpiqtuaġuŋaniqsi Ataniptiŋnun Jesus Christ-mun. "
5872," If from a human point of view I fought with wild beasts at Ephesus, what did it benefit me? If the dead are not raised, let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die. ","Tuquruat aŋipkaqtauniaŋitpata, anniqsuusiaqaġnaġayaitchuq nagliksaaqtitauniq iñuŋniñ piyuaqsiusivsun Ephesus-mi, niġrułłuŋniñ piyuaqsiqsuatun pikama.

5873, Do not be deceived: “Bad company corrupts good morals.” ,Sagluqipkaġnasi iñuŋnun uqaqtuanun tainna. Piqasiqsuutiguvsi ilaiññun maliksugniaqtusi. 
5874," Sober up as you should, and stop sinning! For some have no knowledge of God – I say this to your shame!","Isumasatqigñaqsigaasi nalaunŋaruakun, piḷuusiqiŋaiġḷusi. Iḷasi iḷitchuġiŋaitchut suli God-mik. Taamna uqallausiġigiga kanŋutchaqugaluaqłusi."
5875," But someone will say, “How are the dead raised? With what kind of body will they come?” ","Iḷaanni iñuk apiqsriñiaġmiuq inna, Qanuqłutiŋ tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtitauvat? Qanutchimik timiqaġlutiŋ qaiñiaqpat? "
5876, Fool! What you sow will not come to life unless it dies. ,"Isumalluaġiitchuatiin, iḷisimarutin nautchirriikavich nautchiaksranik nunamun, nausalaitchut nauriaġuġlutiŋ tuquqqaaŋaunnatiŋ nautchirriutitin. "
5877," And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare seed – perhaps of wheat or something else. ",Aasii nautchiaksraq nautchirriutikkan qiññaqaŋitchuq nautchiatun nauyumaaqtuatun nautchiaksramiñ. Nautchirriirutin palauvaksraġuġumaaqtuamik naagga allakaaksramik nautchiaksrałhiñauvlugu. 
5878," But God gives it a body just as he planned, and to each of the seeds a body of its own. ","Aglaan God-im nauriaġuqtitchuugaa, ilaan qanusiutqukamiuŋ, aasii nautchiaksraun naurisuuruq ilaan qanusiuyumaaġutchimisun. "
5879," All flesh is not the same: People have one flesh, animals have another, birds and fish another. ","Tainnatuttauq, uumaruurapayaurat atiruanik timiqaŋiñmiut. Iñuich inmikkulli timiqaqtut, niġrutilliasii allagiiñik timiqaqtut, tiŋmiat suli allauruanik, iqaluitchauq allauruanik. "
5880, And there are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. The glory of the heavenly body is one sort and the earthly another. ,"Isaġulgich qiḷaŋmi timiqaqtut allauruamik, aasiisuli nunamiittuat iñuich allauruamik. Piññaġnautaat qiḷaŋmiittuat timit allauruq piññaġnautaanniñ nunamiŋŋaqtauruat timit. "
5881," There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon and another glory of the stars, for star differs from star in glory.","Atausiuruq qaumanġa siqiñġum, allauvlunisuli qaumanġa tatqim, suli allauvluni qaumanġat uvluġiat, uvluġiaq-una allakaamik qaumaniqaqłuni allamiñ uvluġiamiñ."
5882," It is the same with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable. ","Tainnainmiuq aŋipkaqtauniŋat tuquŋaruat. Timigikkavut paŋmapak nautchiaksratun nautchirriutauruatun ittut nunamun, tuqusuurut. Aglaan aŋipkaqtaugupta timiqaġniaqtugut tuquyumiñaitchuanik. "
5883," It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power; ","Paŋmapak timigikkavut maqusuurut, aglaan aŋipkaqtaugupta, timiniŋniaqtugut qaummaġiksuanik. Paŋmapak timigikkavut suaŋaitchut, aglaan aŋipkaqtitaugupta, timivut suaŋaniaqtut. "
5884," it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body. ","Paŋmapak timivut iñugruiññaurut, aglaan aŋipkaqtaugupta, ilitqutchich timiŋiññik timiniŋniaqtugut. "
5885," So also it is written, “The first man, Adam, became a living person”; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit. ","Taavrumuuna aglautiŋaruq Bible-ni inna, “Iñuqqaaq Adam iñuġuŋaruq.” Aglaan Christ iḷiŋaruq allatun Adam-tun aitchuiruaq iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. "
5886," However, the spiritual did not come first, but the natural, and then the spiritual. ","Nalunaigisiuŋ, ilitqutchim timaa sivulliuŋaitchuq. Iñugruiññaum timaa sivulliuŋaruq, aquagun aasii ilitqutchim timaa. "
5887," The first man is from the earth, made of dust; the second man is from heaven. ","Iñuqqaaq nunamiñŋaqtauruq, nunam avyuaniñ. Iñulitqiun qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruq. "
5888," Like the one made of dust, so too are those made of dust, and like the one from heaven, so too those who are heavenly. ",Iñupayaaŋi nunam tainnatun ittut taavrumatun savaaguŋaruatun nunamiñ. Iluqaġmiŋ qiḷaŋmuŋniaqtuat tainnatun inmiut ilaatun qaiŋaruatun qiḷaŋmiñ. 
5889," And just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, let us also bear the image of the man of heaven.","Irrusiptiktun paŋmapak iñuktun savaaguŋaruatun nunam avyuaniñ, tainnatun iḷiyumaaġmiut iñuktun qairuatun qiḷaŋmiñ. "
5890," Now this is what I am saying, brothers and sisters: Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable. ","Uqallautigivsi aniqatiit. Iñugruiññaich timiqaqtuat uviñiqaqłutiŋ auqaqłutiglu aitchuusiaġiyumiñaitkaich quviasuutiŋi qiḷaum, tainnatuttauq maqusuuruat timit aitchuusiaġiyumiñaiñmigaat maquyumiñaitchuaq."
5891," Listen, I will tell you a mystery: We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed – ","Uvva uqallautigivsi kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruamik qaŋapak. Tamatkiġḷuta siñigniaŋitchugut tuqqunmi, aglaan uvagut iluqata allaŋŋuqtauniaqtugut, "
5892," in a moment, in the blinking of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. ","akkupauraq, sukałhaaġluguunnii iñuum siqunġipaŋniŋaniñ, nipauqłuktaun nivliqpan nuna isukłitpan. Qanuq nipauqłuktaun nivliġñiaqtuq, aasii tuquŋaruat aŋipkaqtauniaqtut tuqutqikkumiñaiġḷutiŋ, aasii allaŋŋuqtitauluta. "
5893," For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality. ",Qanuq una maqulisuuruaq irrusiq simmausiqsuksrauruq maquliyumiñaitchuamik irrutchimik. Una tuqusuuruaq irrusiq simmausiqsuksrauruq tuqulaitchuamik irrusiñigluni. 
5894," Now when this perishable puts on the imperishable, and this mortal puts on immortality, then the saying that is written will happen,","Maqusuuruaq irrusiq simmausiqpan maqulaitchuamik irrutchimik, tuqullaruaq simmausiġḷuni tuqullaiqsuamik tavrani taŋŋiġñiaqtuq aglautiŋaruaq Bible-ni inna, “Tuqqun akiiḷiraupiallaktuq.”"
5895,“Death has been swallowed up in victory.”,
5896," “Where, O death, is your victory?",
5897,"Where, O death, is your sting?”",
5898," The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law. ",
5899," But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ! ",
5900," So then, dear brothers and sisters, be firm. Do not be moved! Always be outstanding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.",
5901," From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God that is in Corinth, with all the saints who are in all Achaia. ","Ukua tuyuutit qairut ilivsiññun Paul-miñ tiliraŋaniñ Jesus Christ pisuutaagun God-im, Timothy-miḷḷu aniqatiptiŋniñ.

5902, Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!,"Nagliktuusiaqpaqaġitchisuq tutqiunmiglu God-miñ Aapaptiŋniñ, Ataniptiŋniḷḷu Jesus Christ-miñ."
5903," Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort, ","Nanġaġlakput God, Aapaŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ, Aapauruaq nagliktauvluni suli qapiŋaisaaqłiiḷḷavluni. "
5904, who comforts us in all our troubles so that we may be able to comfort those experiencing any trouble with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. ,"God-im qapiŋaisaaġuugaatigut iluqaiññi iłuiḷḷiuġutiptiŋni, uvaptiŋnulli qapiŋaisaaġumiñaquvlugich iñuich allat iłuiḷḷiuliqpata qanusipayaakun iłuiḷḷiuġutikun, tainnaptauq God-im qapiŋaisaaqłiisiatun uvaptiŋnik. "
5905," For just as the sufferings of Christ overflow toward us, so also our comfort through Christ overflows to you. ","Qanutupayauraq iḷaŋiutikapta Christ nagliksaaġutigiŋakkaŋiñun, tainnatuttauq qanutupayauraq Christ qapiŋaisaaġuummigaatigut. "
5906," But if we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; if we are comforted, it is for your comfort that you experience in your patient endurance of the same sufferings that we also suffer. ","Iłuiḷḷiuqtitaukapta tusaayugaaġiksuaq pisigivlugu, taamna qapiŋaisaaġutauruksrauruq ilivsiññun annaurrauniksravsiññullu.

5907," And our hope for you is steadfast because we know that as you share in our sufferings, so also you will share in our comfort. ","Nalupqisuŋitchugut ilivsi iłuiḷḷiuqtitaksrauniġuvsi uvaptiktuttauq, qapiŋaisaaġniaġmigaasi God-im uvaptiktun. "
5908," For we do not want you to be unaware, brothers and sisters, regarding the affliction that happened to us in the province of Asia, that we were burdened excessively, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of living. ","Nalutquŋitkivsi aniqatiit, qanutun suamatigivlugu iłuiḷḷiuqtitauŋatilaamnik nunaŋani Asia-m, iłuiḷḷiuqtitauvaił̣ł̣uŋa qaaŋiqł̣uguunnii igḷutuiyumiñaġniġa, nalupqitchaŋagaluaqtuŋa iñuuniaqtilaamnik. "
5909," Indeed we felt as if the sentence of death had been passed against us, so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead. ","Tavraami, iḷumutun isumalipiaġaluaqtuŋa tuqquviksraġa tikiññasugalugu. Taavruma nalautaġma iḷisautigaaŋa nayummatigiraksraġiŋipiaqtilaamnik uvamnik, aglaan God-mun aŋipkairuamun tuquruanik. "
5910," He delivered us from so great a risk of death, and he will deliver us. We have set our hope on him that he will deliver us yet again, ","Ilaan iñuuliŋagaaŋa tuquruksraġuqama tuqquviksramaaġnaitchuamiñ, suli iñuulivsaaġniaġaaŋa. Suliami niġiugigiga iñuuligaluamiiġñiaqtilaaġa ilaanun. "
5911," as you also join in helping us by prayer, so that many people may give thanks to God on our behalf for the gracious gift given to us through the help of many.","Suli ikayugaksraġigivsiŋa aŋaiyyutiluŋa, iñugiaktuat iñuich quyyatiksraqaġumaut God-mun iñuuliraunipkun, kiuvlugich iñugiaktuat iñuich aŋaiyyutiŋich."
5912," For our reason for confidence is this: the testimony of our conscience, that with pure motives and sincerity which are from God – not by human wisdom but by the grace of God – we conducted ourselves in the world, and all the more toward you. ","Quyaruŋa isumama killuliqirualiŋiñmaŋa itqaġaġikapku iñuuniaġusiġa sivuġaanni iñupayaat, ilivsił̣haaġluami takkuvsiññi, qanuq iñuuŋaruŋa piḷuutaitchuakun piŋŋuaġutaitchuakullu sivuġaani God-im. Iluqaan iññiqiniġa aulanŋitkaa iñugruiññaum pisaasuutaata, aglaan God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋata. "
5913, For we do not write you anything other than what you can read and also understand. But I hope that you will understand completely ,"Tavra tuyuutitka ilivsiññun taiguallagisi kaŋiqsiḷḷuatallagisiḷu, malġugnik sivuniqaŋitchut.

5914," just as also you have partly understood us, that we are your source of pride just as you also are ours in the day of the Lord Jesus. ","Qanuq uvaŋa nalupqisuŋitchuŋa ilivsi arguasuŋisilaavsiññik piŋŋuaŋisilaamnik, ullaqqaaġuŋagivsi aasii ullatqiḷgiḷḷusi, piqaquvlusi malġuiqsuaġlugu quviasaaġusiamik. "
5915," And with this confidence I intended to come to you first so that you would get a second opportunity to see us, ","Innauvva, ullagukkivsi sivunmukkuma nunaŋiñun Macedonia-m, aasii utilgitkuma Macedonia-miñ nalaulgiḷḷusi, ilivsiññun upaluŋaiyaquluŋa iglauniksramnun Judea-mun. "
5916, and through your help to go on into Macedonia and then from Macedonia to come back to you and be helped on our way into Judea by you. ,"Tainna piyumakama, isummitqigaqsiññaqtuaguvik? Naumi. Sivunniulaitchuŋa uvaŋa nunam iñuŋisun, aŋiqqaaqłutiŋ piḷaitchuatun. "
5917," Therefore when I was planning to do this, I did not do so without thinking about what I was doing, did I? Or do I make my plans according to mere human standards so that I would be saying both “Yes, yes” and “No, no” at the same time? ","Nalupqinaisilaaŋatun God-im iḷumun itilaaŋa, tainnatun uqaluutivut ilivsiññun aŋŋautaugiññaŋaitchut piyumaaŋiḷḷapta. "
5918," But as God is faithful, our message to you is not “Yes” and “No.” ","Silas-lu Timothy-lu uvaŋalu alġaqsruutigiŋagikput ilivsiññun Iġñiŋa God-im, Jesus Christ. Ilaa inŋitchuq iñuktun aŋiqqaaqłuni taŋŋiiḷaitchuatun. Ilaan ataramik pisuugaa suna piñiaġnivḷugu uqallausiġirani. "
5919," For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, the one who was proclaimed among you by us – by me and Silvanus and Timothy – was not “Yes” and “No,” but it has always been “Yes” in him. ","Qanuq ilaagun iluqaġmiŋ God-im unniqsuqłiisiŋi taŋŋiŋarut. Taamna pisigivlugu uqallausiġisuugikput Amen, ilaagun nanġaqaptigu God. "
5920," For every one of God’s promises are “Yes” in him; therefore also through him the “Amen” is spoken, to the glory we give to God. ","God-im atausiŋŋuqataupkaŋagaatigut uvagullu ilivsiḷu Christ-mun, suli ilaaguaqłuta ilaan savaamiñun, "
5921," But it is God who establishes us together with you in Christ and who anointed us, ","nalunaiñŋutchiqł̣uta inmiñuksrivḷuta, Ilitqusiġiksuani iñuupkallasivḷugu uummatiptiŋni iḷisimatquvluta ilaanun pigitilaaptiŋnik."
5922, who also sealed us and gave us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment.,"Qaisukkaluaŋŋaġmaunnii Corinth-mun, qaiŋitchuŋa. God iḷisimaruq iḷumun ittuamik uqaqtilaamnik ilivsiññun. Qaiŋirrutigigiga qanusiġaġuŋił̣ł̣usi. "
5923," Now I appeal to God as my witness, that to spare you I did not come again to Corinth. ","Atanniqsimasuŋił̣ł̣usi ilivsi ukpiġutisiḷu, qanuq ukpiqtuagulluataqavsi, aglaan savaqatigisukkivsi quviasuutivsaaqaquvlusi pisigilugu ukpiġutiksi."
5924," I do not mean that we rule over your faith, but we are workers with you for your joy, because by faith you stand firm. ",
5925, So I made up my own mind not to pay you another painful visit. ,Sivunnipiaŋaruŋa isumaaġnaqtuakun ullatqiguŋił̣ł̣usi. 
5926," For if I make you sad, who would be left to make me glad but the one I caused to be sad? ","Qanuq uvaŋa quviasuutaiqsitkuvsi, allamik iñuŋmik quviasaaqtiksraitchuŋa ilivsi quviasuutaiqsittaġma quviasaaŋisuaġuvsiŋa. "
5927," And I wrote this very thing to you, so that when I came I would not have sadness from those who ought to make me rejoice, since I am confident in you all that my joy would be yours. ","Suli tuyuŋaruŋa aqulliġñi tuyuutimni tainna tuyuusivsun, isumaat chaktitquŋił̣ł̣uŋa ilivsiññun ullakkuvsi quviatchaktitiksramnun, qanuq nalupqisuŋitchuŋa quviasuunma quviatchaktinniaġmigaasi. "
5928," For out of great distress and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears, not to make you sad, but to let you know the love that I have especially for you. ","Tuyuqavsi, iłuiḷḷiupiaġataŋaruŋa isumaaqłuŋalu iḷumni, qiaŋaruŋaunnii, mamiatchaquŋitkivsi aglaan iḷisimatqugivsi qanutupayauraq piviuttaġitilaavsiññik."
5929," But if anyone has caused sadness, he has not saddened me alone, but to some extent (not to exaggerate) he has saddened all of you as well. ","Aglaan taavruma iñuum isumaalluksairuam kisima isumaaqtinŋaitkaaŋa, aglaattauq ilivsi isumaaqtitaŋammigaasi, tunikłisaqługu uqallausiġigiga. "
5930," This punishment on such an individual by the majority is enough for him, ",Taamna iñuk naamaruamik tatavsausiaqaaniktuq atisivḷusi naġġuksruqavsiuŋ. 
5931, so that now instead you should rather forgive and comfort him. This will keep him from being overwhelmed by excessive grief to the point of despair. ,"Tavraasii paŋmapak suliqutigiŋaigaksraġigiksi itqaumaŋaiġḷugu killuliqiaŋa, aasii qapiŋaisaaġlugu payaritquŋiḷḷugu mamiatchaunmun igḷutuġumiñaiġḷugu tatavsausiani. "
5932, Therefore I urge you to reaffirm your love for him. ,Tavraasii iŋiulagivsi tuniqsiḷaatqiquvlugu piviuttaqqutiksi ilaanun. 
5933, For this reason also I wrote you: to test you to see if you are obedient in everything. ,"Taamnalu pisigivlugu tuyuŋagivsi, uvaŋa uuktuaġukłusi iḷitchuġisaġluŋa kamakkutiqaġniaqtilaavsiññik supayaakun. "
5934," If you forgive anyone for anything, I also forgive him – for indeed what I have forgiven (if I have forgiven anything) I did so for you in the presence of Christ, ","Kialiqaa killuliqiaŋa suliqutigiŋaikkaqsi itqaumaŋaiqł̣ugu, uvaŋaptauq suliqutigiŋaiġmigiga itqaumaŋaiqł̣ugu. Suliqutigiŋaiŋagupku killuliqun itqaumayumiñaiġḷugu, suliqutigiŋaiġiga pisigivlusi, suli pisivlugu Christ. "
5935, so that we may not be exploited by Satan (for we are not ignorant of his schemes). ,"Pitchaiḷisaqługu Tuunġaq atiqaqtuaq Satan-mik akimmatiksraŋaniñ uvaptiŋniñ, qanuq naluŋiñmigivut ilaan piraġausiŋi."
5936," Now when I arrived in Troas to proclaim the gospel of Christ, even though the Lord had opened a door of opportunity for me, ","Tikiññama Troas-mun alġaqsruutigisukługu tusaayugaaġiksuaq Christ-kun, Atanġum piviksriñŋagaaŋa alġaqsruitquvluŋa, "
5937," I had no relief in my spirit, because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I said good-bye to them and set out for Macedonia.",aglaan isumaga tutqiksiḷḷaiŋaruq paqinŋiññapku aniqatiga Titus tavrani. Tavraasii qimaŋagitka aasii iglauvluŋa Macedonia-mun.
5938, But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumphal procession in Christ and who makes known through us the fragrance that consists of the knowledge of him in every place. ,"Aglaan God quyyavigirauli ataramik akimapkairuaq uvaptiŋnik pisigivlugu atausiŋŋuqatauŋaniqput Christ-lu, suli tilisiruaq uvaptiŋnik sumulliqaa, quliaqtuaġutitquvlugich iñuich Christ-mik. "
5939, For we are a sweet aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing – ,"Qanuq iviġakkikput God alġaqsruutigikaptigu Christ akunġanni iñupayaat, tamatkua annaurrauniaqtuallu suksraunġiqsauniaqtuallu. "
5940," to the latter an odor from death to death, but to the former a fragrance from life to life. And who is adequate for these things? ","Tamatkua suksraunġiqsauniaqtuat qanuqpisiiḷḷivḷugich tuquniksraŋannun piḷuusiqiraulutiŋ, tamatkuali annaurrauniaqtuat attaqsraŋaivsaaqługich iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. Kiña nalliummativa alġaqsruutigiyumiñaqługu tusaayugaaġiksuaq? "
5941," For we are not like so many others, hucksters who peddle the word of God for profit, but we are speaking in Christ before God as persons of sincerity, as persons sent from God.","Kisimiŋ tamatkua uvaptiktun ittuat, alġaqsruiruat piŋŋuaġutaitchuakun, nalunaiqsaŋi God-im, alġaqsruiruat iḷumun ittuamik Christ-kun, God-im takkuani pimmatun.

5942," Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? We don’t need letters of recommendation to you or from you as some other people do, do we? ","Isumanasi uvamnun uqautitqiksaġasugalusi uvagut nalliumatiniḷuta akuqtuusiaksraptiŋnun ilivsiññiñ.

5944," revealing that you are a letter of Christ, delivered by us, written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not on stone tablets but on tablets of human hearts.","aasii allaŋŋuqtauruatigun iñuutchivsigun iḷisimanaqtitkiksi ilivsi itilaaqsi tuyuutitun aglaaŋisun Christ, uvagut alġaqsruiñiptigun ilivsiññun.

5945, Now we have such confidence in God through Christ. ,"Tavra allaŋŋuqtauŋaruat iñuutchivsi nalupqisuŋisitkaanŋa, alġaqsruiñiġa akuqtuġnaqtilaaŋanik God-mun Christ ikayuqłuŋa. "
5946," Not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything as if it were coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, ","Isumanaqsiḷiġuŋitkiga uvaptuġruiññaq piḷḷasiñasugalugu iñiqsiñiq tainnatchimik savaamik. God-im suaŋŋasiqsuġaaŋa, "
5947," who made us adequate to be servants of a new covenant not based on the letter but on the Spirit, for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.","nalliummatillasivḷuŋa alġaqsruutigiyumiñaqługu God-im nutauruaq sivunniuġutaa iñuich annagniksraŋatigun.

God-im nutauruaq sivunniuġutaa iñuggutauruq isuitchuamun Ilitqusiġiksuakun."
5948," But if the ministry that produced death – carved in letters on stone tablets – came with glory, so that the Israelites could not keep their eyes fixed on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face (a glory which was made ineffective), ","Utuqqauruaq sivunniuġun titiqtuurrauŋaruq uyaġaŋmun, aasii iñuich iḷitchuġipkaqługich piḷuutautilaaŋanik kamaksriŋiññiq God-mik aasii tuqqutaullavluni.

5949, how much more glorious will the ministry of the Spirit be? ,"Aasiiḷi igḷuani, qaummaġił̣haasugruktuaq piqatauruq nutauruamun sivunniuġunmun, qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam itqanaiyaġai iñuich iñuuniksraŋannun qiḷaŋmi. "
5950," For if there was glory in the ministry that produced condemnation, how much more does the ministry that produces righteousness excel in glory! ","Iñuich aliuŋarut tautukamirruŋ qaumaniqpak utuqqauruaq sivunniuġun aitchuutaumman, iḷitchuġipkaġmatiŋ suksraunġiqsauniksramik.

5951," For indeed, what had been glorious now has no glory because of the tremendously greater glory of what replaced it. ","Aasiisuli nutauruaq sivunniuġun qanutupayauraq aliuġnałhamaaqtigiruq utuqqauruamiñ sivunniuġunmiñ, utuqqauruaq sivunniuġun iḷiḷḷavlugu aliuġnautiqaŋaitchuatun qaŋaunnii. "
5952," For if what was made ineffective came with glory, how much more has what remains come in glory! ","Qanuq utuqqauruaq sivunniuġun isukłiñŋaruaq aliuġnaŋakpan, nutauruaq sivunniuġun isukłitchumiñaitchuaq aliuġnałhamaaqtuksrauruq."
5953," Therefore, since we have such a hope, we behave with great boldness, ","Uvagut iḷisimavlugu God-im nutauruaq sivunniuġutaa isukłitchumiñaisilaaŋanik, minitchiḷuta iḷaŋanik alġaqsruiŋitchugut. "
5954, and not like Moses who used to put a veil over his face to keep the Israelites from staring at the result of the glory that was made ineffective. ,Moses-tun piŋitchugut matutuliqsuatun kiiññamiñik Israel-guruat tautuquŋił̣ł̣ugich qaumanini nalunaqsisaiññaqtilaaŋanik. 
5955," But their minds were closed. For to this very day, the same veil remains when they hear the old covenant read. It has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away. ","Iliŋich kaŋiqsiḷaiñŋarut, qanuq uvlupak-unnii taiguaqamiŋ God-im utuqqauruamik sivunniuġutaanik, kaŋiqsiḷaitchut simmausiŋatilaaŋanik ilaan nutauruamik sivunniuġutaanik Christ-kun. Taamna ittuq Moses-gum taalutaqtuutaatun piiŋaitchuatun suli. Kisianik ukpiliġmata Christ-mun taamna taalutaq piiqsausuuruq. "
5956," But until this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds, ","Aaŋ, uvlupaŋmun-aglaan isumaŋich taalutaqtuqtuatun suli ittut naalaġnikamisigik Moses aglaaŋi, iñuum taiguaġmagich. "
5957," but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed. ","Aglaan iñuk mumikami Ataniġmun kaŋiqsisuuruq, taalutaq piiġmatun isumaŋaniñ. "
5958," Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is present, there is freedom. ","Atanġum tavrani sivuniġigaa Ilitqusiġiksuaq aitchuiruaq iñuggunmik, aasii Ilitqusiġiksuaq iñuŋmiinman, taamna iñuk atanniqsimaraitchuq. "
5959," And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, which is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.","Tavraasii uvagut ukpiqtuaguruaguut taalutaitchugut iriġumiñaġluta Atanġum qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruamiñ qaumanġaniñ.

5960," Therefore, since we have this ministry, just as God has shown us mercy, we do not become discouraged. ","Aitchuusiaqaġniqapta nagliktuutaagun God-im, qanutun aliuġnaqtigiruamik alġaqsruutigiraksramik uqaluksrirrusiamik, nikatchagluta aġiulaitchugut. "
5961," But we have rejected shameful hidden deeds, not behaving with deceptiveness or distorting the word of God, but by open proclamation of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone’s conscience before God. ","Paaqsaaŋagiga kiñaliqaa alġaqsruiruaq suqpanaqsiḷiqłuni naagga iḷumun inŋitchuamik, naagga pisaasuġmiaġutikun, naagga allaŋŋuqtiqługu God-im uqalua. Tainna uvaŋa piḷaitchuŋa.

5962," But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing, ","Aasii tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutigikkaġa talutuġniqpan kimulliqaa, talutuġniqsuq kisiiññun tamatkunuŋa suksraunġiqsauniaqtuanun. "
5963," among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of those who do not believe so they would not see the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God. ","Tamatkua ukpiliŋaitchuat kaŋiqsitchaiḷiraġai tusaayugaaġiksuamik god-iŋata mattuma nunam, Tuunġaum. Ayaupkaqtitauruatun ittut, tautuquŋił̣ł̣ugu qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruaq qaumanġa Christ, God-itun ittuam. "
5964," For we do not proclaim ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus’ sake. ",Alġaqsruutigigikput Jesus Christ Atanġunivḷugu. Alġaqsruutigiŋitchuŋa uvamnik. Uvagut ilivsi kivgaġigiptigut Jesus pisigivlugu. 
5965," For God, who said “Let light shine out of darkness,” is the one who shined in our hearts to give us the light of the glorious knowledge of God in the face of Christ.","God-im uqallaŋaruam uumiŋa, “Qaummaum simmausiġḷiuŋ taaqtuaq,” kaŋiqsipkaŋagaatigut aliuġnaqtuamik kamanautaanik Christ. Ilaimña ilaan simmausikkaŋa taaqtuaŋa uummatipta ilaan qaumaniġmiñik, uvaptiŋnun iḷitchuġipkaqługu ilaan qaumanini takunnaqaptigu Jesus kiiñaŋa."
5966," But we have this treasure in clay jars, so that the extraordinary power belongs to God and does not come from us. ","Aglaan uvva pigigikput taamna piqpaŋnaqtuaq aitchuusiaq puuqaqsiññaqługu nunamiñ savaanik timiptiŋnik, sunauvva tautuquvlugu iñupayaanun taamna sapiġñaqtuaq suaŋŋan iḷuptiŋniittuaq God-miñ piruagutilaaŋanik, uvaptiŋniñ pisuŋaġnani. "
5967," We are experiencing trouble on every side, but are not crushed; we are perplexed, but not driven to despair; ","Qanusipayaakun iłuiḷḷiuqtitaugaluaġaqtugut, akiiḷipkalaitchugut. Qanuqsausiiqsitaugaluaġmiraqtugut, uiŋasiḷaitchugut. "
5968," we are persecuted, but not abandoned; we are knocked down, but not destroyed, ","Nagliksaaqtitaugaluaqapta suksraalaiñmigaatigut. Ilauvagut akiḷḷivsa ulġutkaluakkaŋatigut, aglaan tuqunŋił̣ł̣uta. "
5969," always carrying around in our body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our body. ","Tavraasii ataramik anayanniuqtuaqtugut tuqutauniksramun, Jesus-tuttauq iḷisimanaqsitquvlugu iñuulipkaġuutilaaqput Jesus-mun iñuuruamun iḷuptiŋni. "
5970," For we who are alive are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus’ sake, so that the life of Jesus may also be made visible in our mortal body. ","Iñuuniqtutilaaptiktun, itqanaitchugut tuquyumiñaqłuta Jesus pisigilugu. Tamauŋanun aglaan tuqutauŋaiñŋuraqpata iḷisimanaqtitkivut Jesus-mun iñuuruamun iḷuptiŋni iñuulimatilaaŋiññik tuquyumaaqtuat timivut. "
5971," As a result, death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. ","Anayanniuqtuaqtugut tuqqunmiñ pisigivlugu alġaqsruiñiqput, ilivsi piqaquvlusi isuitchuamik iñuggunmik."
5972," But since we have the same spirit of faith as that shown in what has been written, “I believed; therefore I spoke,” we also believe, therefore we also speak. ","Uqautigigikput taluqsraiqł̣uta ukpiġikkaqput, tainnatchimiktauq ukpiġutiqaqłuta iñuktun aglaŋaruatun Bible-ni inna, “Ukpilianikama uqarraqsiŋaruŋa.” "
5973, We do so because we know that the one who raised up Jesus will also raise us up with Jesus and will bring us with you into his presence. ,"Nalupqigiŋitkikput God aŋipkaiŋaruaq Ataniġmik Jesus-mik, aŋipkaiyumiñaqtilaaŋaniktauq uvaptiŋnik atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruanik Jesus-mun, aasii qaġġisiluta piqatigilusi ilaan irviŋmiñun. "
5974," For all these things are for your sake, so that the grace that is including more and more people may cause thanksgiving to increase to the glory of God. ","Iluqaan igḷutukkaġa anniqsuutauruq ilivsiññun, iñuvsaat kiikaa annaurraummata God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun, quyyativsaaksraqaqtusi God-mun, aasii ilaa nanġausiaqavsaalgiḷḷuni."
5975," Therefore we do not despair, but even if our physical body is wearing away, our inner person is being renewed day by day. ","Tavraasii nikatchagluta aġiulaitchugut. Timivut piyyuġuqsaiññaġaluaqtillugich, uvagupiaqput iḷuptiŋniittuaq suaŋasiḷaaqtauviiññaġuuruq nutauruamik iñuggunmik uvlutuaġman. "
5976," For our momentary, light suffering is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison ","Tamatkua iłuiḷḷiuġutivut paŋmapak suuvigruaŋitchut sivisuŋitchullu, itqanaiyaqsiññaġaatigut nakuaqsrisigitquvlugich God-im kamanaġniqsrat quviasuutiksrirrutiŋi uvaptiŋnun isuitchuamun. "
5977," because we are not looking at what can be seen but at what cannot be seen. For what can be seen is temporary, but what cannot be seen is eternal.","Qanuq qiñiqtuiññaŋitkikput suna tautugnaqtuaq, aglaan ukpiġutikun qiñiqtuiññaġikput tautugnaitchuaq, qanuq suna tautugnaqtuaq piiġumaaqtuq, aglaan suna tautugnaitchuaq isuksraitchuq."
5978," For we know that if our earthly house, the tent we live in, is dismantled, we have a building from God, a house not built by human hands, that is eternal in the heavens. ","Qanuq iḷisimarugut tupqich iñuuvigikkavut nunami maqutaugaluaqpata, timivut, igluqpaqaqtugut qiḷaŋmi maqutauyumiñaitchuanik, God-im savaaŋiñik, iñuich savaaġiŋisaŋiññik. "
5979," For in this earthly house we groan, because we desire to put on our heavenly dwelling, ","Uumani paŋmapak timigikkaptiŋni iiqtualiġuurugut, piḷaiġuuvluta, piyummipiaġataġaqtugut allaŋŋuqtautquyumavlugich timit qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruaġuġlugich, "
5980," if indeed, after we have put on our heavenly house, we will not be found naked. ",qanuq ilitqusił̣hiñauyumaaŋitchugut timaiḷḷuta. 
5981," For we groan while we are in this tent, since we are weighed down, because we do not want to be unclothed, but clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. ","Iñuuŋŋapta makkunani tupiġni, iñugruiññauvluta timiptiŋni, iiqtuaġuurugut iłuiḷḷiuġutiqaqłuta.

5982," Now the one who prepared us for this very purpose is God, who gave us the Spirit as a down payment. ","Taavrumuŋauvva God-im itqanaiyaġaatigut, suli ilaan aitchuŋagaatigut Ilitqusiġiksuamiñik, uvaptiŋnun nalupqigitquŋił̣ł̣ugu."
5983," Therefore we are always full of courage, and we know that as long as we are alive here on earth we are absent from the Lord – ","Tavraasii ataramik qapiŋaisaaġusiaqaġluataġuurugut. Iḷisimarugut iñuuŋŋapta makkunani iñugruiññauruani timini, niguqsimarugut Ataniġmiñ, "
5984," for we live by faith, not by sight. ","iñuuvluta ukpiġutikun, ilaa tautuaġiŋił̣ł̣ugu. "
5985, Thus we are full of courage and would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord. ,"Qapiŋaisaaġusiaqaġluataqtugut, aasii timigikaptiŋniñ piitchumałhaaġaluaqtugut aimaaġukkaluaqłuta piqatigilugu Ataniq. "
5986," So then whether we are alive or away, we make it our ambition to please him. ","Tavraasii, aimaaġaluaġupta piqatigilugu Ataniq, naagga piitkaluaġupta ilaaniñ, ataramik iviġaumaniḷupiaġikput. "
5987," For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be paid back according to what he has done while in the body, whether good or evil.","Qanuq iluqata niptaqtuksraupiaqtugut sivuġaanun Christ aasii isivġiqsauluta, atausiullaaluta, akiḷiusiaqaġumaugut sutigun piŋaraptigun iñuuŋŋapta timigikkaptiŋni nunami, nakuuruatigun naagga pigiitchuatigun."
5988," Therefore, because we know the fear of the Lord, we try to persuade people, but we are well known to God, and I hope we are well known to your consciences too. ","Taamna tainnainman, puttuqsrivḷuta Atanġum qiksigiraksrautilaaŋanik, uvagut ukpiqusaaġivut iñuich. God iḷisimaruq ukpiġnaqtilaaptiŋnik alġaqsruiñiptiŋni, aasiivsauq puttuqsritquyumagiga taamna ilivsiññun. "
5989," We are not trying to commend ourselves to you again, but are giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you may be able to answer those who take pride in outward appearance and not in what is in the heart. ","Uvagut akuqtuġnaqsiñiavsaaŋitchugut uvaptiŋnik ilivsiññun, aglaan kanŋugiyumiñaiqsinniḷuksiññaqtugut, ilivsi kiggutiksraqaquvlusi iñuŋnun kamasaaġutiqaqtuanun iñuich qiññaŋannik, puttuqsrisuŋaġnagu qanupiaq itilaaŋat iḷumiŋni. "
5990," For if we are out of our minds, it is for God; if we are of sound mind, it is for you. ","Kinnaġuqpisa uvagut? Tainna iñuich iḷaŋisa uqautigigaatigut. Kinnaġuġniġupta, taamna nanġautauruq God-mun. Qaurimmaġiiġñiġupta, anniqsuusiaqautiginiaġiksi. "
5991," For the love of Christ controls us, since we have concluded this, that Christ died for all; therefore all have died. ","Iluqaisa savaavut pigivut, pisigivlugu Christ piviuttaqqutiqpaŋa uvaptiŋnun. Nalupqigiŋaiŋagikput Christ tuqqurriŋatilaaŋa iñupayaanik, tavraasii iluqaġmiŋ tuquŋarut. "
5992, And he died for all so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and was raised. ,"Iḷiŋavluta tuquqatigiŋaruatun Christ, uvagut tavraŋŋaaglaan uvaptiŋnułhiñaq iñuuŋaiqsuksraurugut aglaan pisilugu Christ tuquŋaruaq aasii aŋipkaqtauvluni pisigivluta."
5993," So then from now on we acknowledge no one from an outward human point of view. Even though we have known Christ from such a human point of view, now we do not know him in that way any longer. ","Tavra paŋmapaŋmiñ aglaan, isummatigiŋaiġikput kiñaliqaa qaałhiñamigun qiññaŋaniñ. Qaŋauvlugu isummatigisuuŋagaluaġuptigu Christ iñugruiññatun iḷivḷugu, tainna isummatigillaiŋagikput. "
5994," So then, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; what is old has passed away – look, what is new has come! ","Tavraasii, kiñaliqaa atausiŋŋuqataukami Christ-mun, nutaaġuqtauruq. Taimanisun inŋaiqsuq tavraŋŋaaglaan, qanuq sivulliich piḷġusikaaŋi piiqsut, aasii ilaa nutaaġuqtauvluni suraġaġnipayaamiñi. "
5995," And all these things are from God who reconciled us to himself through Christ, and who has given us the ministry of reconciliation. ","Iluqaġmi taamna nutaaġuqtauniq qairuq God-miñ, iḷauraaliuqtuamiñ uvaptiŋnik inmiñun Christ-kun, aasii aitchuqłuta savaamik alġaqsruutigitquvlugu ilaan iḷauraaliullatilaani iñuŋnik. "
5996," In other words, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting people’s trespasses against them, and he has given us the message of reconciliation. ","Sivuniġigiga Christ tuqqutaagun, God-im iḷauraaliuŋagai nunam iñuŋi, pasiŋaiqł̣ugich piḷuutiŋisigun. Aasii ilaan piksraqtaaġiŋagaatigut alġaqsruutigitquvlugu uqaluksrirrutini iḷauraaliuġnikun God-mik. "
5997," Therefore we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making His plea through us. We plead with you on Christ’s behalf, “Be reconciled to God!” ","Tavra uvagut Christ kivgaġigaatigut, aasii God-im atuġaatigut uqautitquvlusi. Apiġipiaġivsi, Christ arakłipiaġataġmatun ilivsiññik, iḷauraaliutisitchi God-mun. "
5998," God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that in him we would become the righteousness of God.","God-im Christ piḷuutaiñŋaruaq atausiŋŋuqatigipkaŋagaa piḷuunmun, uvagut atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruaguut Christ-mun, atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagikput God-im nalaunŋataa."
5999," Now because we are fellow workers, we also urge you not to receive the grace of God in vain. ","Uvagut savaqatigiigñiqapta God-lu, apiġipiaġivsi anniqsuusiaqaquvlusi God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun. "
6000," For he says, “I heard you at the acceptable time, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” Look, now is the acceptable time; look, now is the day of salvation! ","Qanuq Bible-ni God uqallaŋaruq,"
6001," We do not give anyone an occasion for taking an offense in anything, so that no fault may be found with our ministry. ","Iñuuniḷuktugut atausiq unnii iñuk ukpiqsaiḷisuŋił̣ł̣ugu Ataniġmun, naġġunaqtuaq paqitquyumaŋił̣ł̣ugu alġaqsruiñiptigun. "

6014," And what mutual agreement does the temple of God have with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said, “I will live in them and will walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people.” ","Taapkunatuttauq God-im aŋaiyyuvikpaŋa imaqaġumiñaiñmiuq iñuuraqpaŋmik.

6015," Therefore “come out from their midst, and be separate,” says the Lord, “and touch no unclean thing, and I will welcome you, ",
6016," and I will be a father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters,” says the All-Powerful Lord.",
6017," Therefore, since we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that could defile the body and the spirit, and thus accomplish holiness out of reverence for God. ","Piginiqaptigik taapkua unniqsuqłiisit, piviuttaġirauruasii, salummaqta uvaptiŋnik piḷuutipayaaniñ timiptiŋnullu ilitqutchiptiŋnullu salumaiḷḷisauruaniñ sivuġaani God-im.

6020, I have great confidence in you; I take great pride on your behalf. I am filled with encouragement; I am overflowing with joy in the midst of all our suffering. ,"Ukpiġiqpakkivsi, suuramikunnii kanŋugiŋitkivsi. Qapiŋaisaaġutauqpaktusi uvamnun, quviatchaktitpakłuŋa iłuiḷḷiuġnimni."
6021," For even when we came into Macedonia, our body had no rest at all, but we were troubled in every way – struggles from the outside, fears from within. ","Tikitkaluaqaptaunnii Macedonia-mun, piḷaiŋiaqsiaġviitchugut, iłuiḷḷiuqtitaukaptaaglaan qanusipayaakun, nagliksaaqtitaunikun ukpinaitchuaniñ, isumaaluutiptalu ukpiqtuanun. "
6022," But God, who encourages the downhearted, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus. ","Aglaan God-im, qapiŋaisaaqłiisuuruam tamatkuniŋa nikatchaktitauruanik, qapiŋaisaaŋagaatigut Titus qaipkaqługu uvaptiŋnun. "
6023," We were encouraged not only by his arrival, but also by the encouragement you gave him, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your deep concern for me, so that I rejoiced more than ever. ","Qapiŋaisaaġusiaqaŋiñmiugut qaiñiŋanik kisianik, aglaallu pisigivlugu ilaan qapiŋaisaaġusiaŋa ilivsiññiñ, ilaan quliaqtuaġutivluta ilivsiññun kipiġniuttaġinivḷuŋa tautugukłuŋa, isumaaluutivsigullu sutigun piruatigun ilivsiññi, suli kipiġniuġutivsiññik iviġagukłuŋa, quviatchavsaapiksuaŋaruŋa tamatkua tusaayugaaġikapkich. "
6024," For even if I made you sad by my letter, I do not regret having written it (even though I did regret it, for I see that my letter made you sad, though only for a short time). ","Isumaaġutigiŋaiġiga tuyuŋaniġa ilivsiññun, nunuurallakkaluaŋaruŋa iḷitchuġiqqaaqama qanutun isumaatchautiginiqavsigik tuyuutitka. Aglaan isumaaqtitkaasi sivikitchuamik. "
6025," Now I rejoice, not because you were made sad, but because you were made sad to the point of repentance. For you were made sad as God intended, so that you were not harmed in any way by us. ","Tavraasii quviasuktuŋa, pisigisuŋaġnagu isumaatchaktitauniqsi, aglaan isumaatchautiginiqavsigik piḷuutisi aasii isumalitqikł̣usi. Tainnatchim isumaaġutim qaġġisillammasi God-mun, anniŋitkivsi. "
6026," For sadness as intended by God produces a repentance that leads to salvation, leaving no regret, but worldly sadness brings about death. ","God-im iñuk isumaaliqsinmagu piḷuutit pisigivlugich, aasii isumalitqikł̣uni iñuum nunuuraġilaitkaa taamna qanuq qaġġirigisuugaa ilaan annaunmun. Aglaalli ukpiŋaitchuam isumaaġutaa tuqqutauruq. "
6027," For see what this very thing, this sadness as God intended, has produced in you: what eagerness, what defense of yourselves, what indignation, what alarm, what longing, what deep concern, what punishment! In everything you have proved yourselves to be innocent in this matter. ","Ilivsiññik iḷitchuġiŋarusi qanutun anniqsuusiaqaġnaqtilaaŋanik isumaaġunmiñ God-im pipkaġmagu.

6028," So then, even though I wrote to you, it was not on account of the one who did wrong, or on account of the one who was wronged, but to reveal to you your eagerness on our behalf before God. ","Tuyuŋagivsi tainna tuyuusivsun sivuġaani God-im puttuqsritquvlusi qanutupayauraq piviuttaqqutiqaqtilaavsiññik uvaptiŋnun.

6029," Therefore we have been encouraged. And in addition to our own encouragement, we rejoiced even more at the joy of Titus, because all of you have refreshed his spirit. ","Tavraasii qapiŋaisaaqtauŋaruŋa. Aasii kisian qapiŋaisaaġusiaġa piqutigiŋitkiga, aglaallu quviasuqatigiłhaaqługu Titus pisigivlugu ilivsi tagialasaaŋiññiqavsiuŋ. "
6030," For if I have boasted to him about anything concerning you, I have not been embarrassed by you, but just as everything we said to you was true, so our boasting to Titus about you has proved true as well. ","Qanuq uvaŋa nanġaŋagivsi ilaanun aasii ilaan inmiñik iḷitchuġivlugu nanġaiñiġa ilivsiññik iḷumun itilaaŋanik.

6031," And his affection for you is much greater when he remembers the obedience of you all, how you welcomed him with fear and trembling. ","Aasii ilaan piviuttaġilivsaaŋagaasi itqaqamiuŋ iluqavsi kamakkutiqaġniqsi inmiñun, piyumapiaqavsigiglu iluqaisa piraksriutiŋi. "
6032, I rejoice because in everything I am fully confident in you.,"Qanutun quviasuktigiruŋa, qanuq nalupqigiŋaiġivsi supayaatigun kamaksriñiaqtilaavsiññik."
6033," Now we make known to you, brothers and sisters, the grace of God given to the churches of Macedonia, ","Aniqatiit, iḷisimatqugivsi aŋaiyyuliqiruanik iluqaani nunaŋani Macedonia-m. Iliŋisa satqummiŋagaat God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋa "
6034," that during a severe ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in the wealth of their generosity. ","iłuiḷḷiuqpauraġaluaŋŋaġmiŋ. Qanutun iḷiappautigigaluaŋŋaġmiŋ aitchuiŋarut siŋñataipiaġataqłutiŋ, qanuq quviasupiaġataŋarut. "
6035," For I testify, they gave according to their means and beyond their means. They did so voluntarily, ","Uqallautiyumiñaġivsi nalupqisuŋiḷḷuŋa iliŋisa aitchuiñiŋannik piyumiñaqtilauramiktun, piyumiñaqtilaaqtikunnii qaaŋiqł̣ugu aitchuiyummatiqaqpaił̣ł̣utiŋ uvamnun unnii kiaqsruŋitkaluaqtillutiŋ. "
6036, begging us with great earnestness for the blessing and fellowship of helping the saints. ,Arapiaġataŋagaatigut akuqtuquvlugich maniich aitchuutitiŋ piqatauyumavlutiŋ quviasuutaani ikayuiñġum ukpiqtuanik Jerusalem-mi. 
6037," And they did this not just as we had hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and to us by the will of God. ","Aasii tamatkua aŋaiyyuliqiruat qaaŋisugruŋagaatunnii niġiugikkaqput, qanuq inmiŋnik ilaaguaqqaaŋarut Ataniġmun. Piyummatiqaŋarut kamagiyumavlugu God-im pisuutigikkaŋa supayaatigun uvagut uqallautiptigun ilimiŋnun. "
6038," Thus we urged Titus that, just as he had previously begun this work, so also he should complete this act of kindness for you. ","Aitchuiŋammata piyummatiqpaqaqłutiŋ kiaqsruŋagikput Titus ullaquvlusi, katitquvlugich aitchuutisi maniich, taavrumuuna naatquvlugu savaaq isagutiŋakkaŋa ilivsiññi. "
6039," But as you excel in everything – in faith, in speech, in knowledge, and in all eagerness and in the love from us that is in you – make sure that you excel in this act of kindness too. ","Tainnaptauq piḷḷuataanikavsi supayaatigun, ukpiġutivsiññi, uqaqtaunivsiññi God-mun, iḷisimmativsiññiḷu Ataniġmik, suli piviuttaqqutivsiññi uvaptiŋnun, tainnatuttauq piḷḷuatapiaġitchi aitchuiñikun."
6040," I am not saying this as a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love by comparison with the eagerness of others. ","Pitquraliŋitkivsi taavrumiŋa pitquuġlusi, aglaan pisuksaaġutigigiññaġiga aitchuiyumalaaġutaa allat, iḷisimanaqsitquvlugu piviuttaqqutiksi iḷumun itilaaŋanik. "
6041," For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that although he was rich, he became poor for your sakes, so that you by his poverty could become rich. ","Qanuq iḷisimagiksi nagliktuutiqpaŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ. Piqataugaluaŋŋaġmi iluqaani God-im kamanautaani iḷiappaguutigiŋagaasi, sunauvva ilaan iḷiappaguġniġmigun ilivsi iḷaŋiutiyumiñaqsitquvlusi God-im kamanautaanun. "
6042," So here is my opinion on this matter: It is to your advantage, since you made a good start last year both in your giving and your desire to give, ","Sivuniġilugu aitchuiñiq, paŋmapak naatquyumagiga ilivsiññun ukiutqik isagutisaŋakkaqsi piyummatigivlugulu. "
6043," to finish what you started, so that just as you wanted to do it eagerly, you can also complete it according to your means. ","Taamna piguvsiuŋ, aitchuiḷusi pigikkavsiññiñ, aitchuiyummatiksi taŋŋiġñiaġiksi aitchuiḷusi. "
6044," For if the eagerness is present, the gift itself is acceptable according to whatever one has, not according to what he does not have. ","Kipiġniupiaġuvsi aitchuisuglusi, naumaniqsrauŋitchuq qanutun aktilaaŋa aitchuutivsi. God-im aitchuitqugaasi pigikkavsiññiñ, pigiŋisavsiññik apiqsriŋitchuq."
6045," For I do not say this so there would be relief for others and suffering for you, but as a matter of equality. ","Sivuniġiŋitkiga ilivsiññik naŋniġlusi kisivsi aitchuiñiqsi pitqulugu, allat iḷasi naŋniisaaqtillugich aitchuiñiġmun, "
6046," At the present time, your abundance will meet their need, so that one day their abundance may also meet your need, and thus there may be equality, ","aglaan atunim piruksraurusi. Sippaksranikavsi paŋmapak, aitchuiyumiñaqsirusi tamatkunuŋa piiḷḷiuqtuanun. Aquvatigulli piiḷḷiunġiġumiŋ ikayuġniaġmigaasi piqaqtuksraġuġuvsi. Tainna piguvsi atunim piqatigiigñiaqtusi. "
6047," as it is written: “The one who gathered much did not have too much, and the one who gathered little did not have too little.”","Aglausimaruatun Bible-ni inna, “Iñuk katitchiqpaktuaq maana-mik sippakuulaaŋaitchuq, suli iñuk katitchipasaŋitchuaq piiḷḷiuŋaiñmiuq.”"
6048," But thanks be to God who put in the heart of Titus the same devotion I have for you, ",Quyyavigigiga God qanuq aitchuŋagaa Titus tainnatuttauq saġiaksrautipiaġatamik ilivsiññun uvaptuttauq. 
6049," because he not only accepted our request, but since he was very eager, he is coming to you of his own accord. ","Ilaan ullagniaġaasi, pisigiłhaasuŋaġnagu uvaŋa takuritqutiga, aglaan pisigilugu ilaan kipiġniuġutini inmiñik ullagumavlusi. "
6050, And we are sending along with him the brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in spreading the gospel. ,Piqasiqsaġiga tilisivḷuŋa aniqanmik iḷisimmaġikkaŋannik aŋaiyyuliqiruat alġaqsruiñiŋagun tusaayugaaġiksuamik. 
6051," In addition, this brother has also been chosen by the churches as our traveling companion as we administer this generous gift to the glory of the Lord himself and to show our readiness to help. ","Taamnatualuk pisaqutauŋiñmiuq, aglaan ilaa nalunaiqsaġivlugulu aŋaiyyuliqiruat iglauqatigitquvluta ilaanun Jerusalem-mun qaitchaqtuġlugich aitchuutit. Taavrumuuna Ataniq nanġaqtauniaqtuq, suli uvagut kipiġniuġutikput ikayuiyumavluta iñuŋnik iḷisimanaqsiḷuni, "
6052, We did this as a precaution so that no one should blame us in regard to this generous gift we are administering. ,"qaunakłaaġuktugut aŋalatchiñiptigun taapkuniŋa aitchuutisalaŋnik maniŋñik, kimulliqaa iḷimagiyumiñaiġḷuta. "
6053, For we are concerned about what is right not only before the Lord but also before men. ,Piyumagikput sunapayaaq Ataniġmun pasiyumiñaiġḷuta iñuŋnullu.
6054," And we are sending with them our brother whom we have tested many times and found eager in many matters, but who now is much more eager than ever because of the great confidence he has in you. ","Aasii piqasiqsaqługik suli taapkuak iññuk, tilisivsaaġmiugut allamik aniqanmik uuktuġaluamiiġuukkaptiŋnik aasii iḷitchuġivlugu ukpiġnaqtuaguvlugu. Qaŋapaŋmiñ unnii paŋmapak kipiġniulivsaaŋaruq ukpiġiliqpaił̣ł̣usi ilaata. "
6055," If there is any question about Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker among you; if there is any question about our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, a glory to Christ. ","Titus-liasii, ilaa piqatigigiga ikayuqtiga uvaŋa ikayuqavsi. Aasii taapkuak aniqatiivut piqatigikkaka, aŋaiyyuliqiruat kivgaŋich, tuvraaksriiḷḷuataqtuk Christ iñuŋiñik. "
6056, Therefore show them openly before the churches the proof of your love and of our pride in you.,"Tavra iḷisimanaqsisiuŋ piviuttaqqurri aŋaiyyuliqiruanun aitchuiḷusi, aasii nalautipiaġlugu nanġaiñiqput ilivsiññik taapkunuŋa iñuŋnun."
6057," For it is not necessary for me to write you about this service to the saints, ","Sivuniġilugu aitchuiñiqsi God-im ilaaguaqtaŋiñun iñuŋnun, tuyuaksraitkaluaġmiusi taavrumuuna, "
6058," because I know your eagerness to help. I keep boasting to the Macedonians about this eagerness of yours, that Achaia has been ready to give since last year, and your zeal to participate has stirred up most of them. ","qanuq iḷisimagivsi aitchuiyummatiqaqtuasii.

Taamna tusaakamirruŋ iñugiaŋniqsrat qapiŋaisaaġusiaġiŋagaat aitchuiñikun. "
6059," But I am sending these brothers so that our boasting about you may not be empty in this case, so that you may be ready just as I kept telling them. ","Tavra tiliñiaġitka aniqatit nalupqinaimmaġiksitquvlugu itqanaipiaqtilaaqsi aitchuutivsigun, uqaġiŋakavsi itqanaiññiaġnivḷusi, uqautigilluataŋavlusi, taamna taŋiġitquŋitkiga. "
6060," For if any of the Macedonians should come with me and find that you are not ready to give, we would be humiliated (not to mention you) by this confidence we had in you. ","Qanuq iñuich iḷaŋich iḷaanni qaikpata Macedonia-miñ maligluŋa, iḷitchuġikparruŋ itqanaiñŋisilaaqsi nalupqisuŋipiaqqaaġlutiŋ itqanaitchualiŋavlusi, kamanaiqsauviaqtugut uvaŋalu ilivsiḷu. "
6061," Therefore I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to go to you in advance and to arrange ahead of time the generous contribution you had promised, so this may be ready as a generous gift and not as something you feel forced to do. ","Tavra isummiŋaruŋa aniqatit ayutqulugich ilivsiññun sivumni kiaqsrugaksraupiaġasugalusi, aasii iłuaqsruiḷutiŋ sivuani taapkunuuna aitchuutiksratigun unniqsuqłiisigiŋakkavsigun aitchuutisi itqanaitchumaut. Aitchuitquyumagivsi piyummatiqaġlusi, pipkaġniapiaqtauŋaiġḷusi."
6062," My point is this: The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously. ",Nalunaigilugu una. Iñuk nautchirriiruaq iñugiapiaŋitchuanik nautchiaksranik katitchiñiaqtuq iñugiapiaŋitchuaniktauq nauruanik nautchiaksrat nauganikpata. Aasiivsauq iñuk nautchirriiruaq iñugiaktuanik nautchiaksranik katitchiñiaġmiuq iñugiaktuanik nautchianik. 
6063," Each one of you should give just as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, because God loves a cheerful giver. ","Ilivsigullaa iñuich ilivsi aitchuisitchi sivunniutivsisun, pisuŋitkavsautigillaan piŋaiġḷusi, naagga piruksraupiaġasugalusi. God-im piviuttaġigaa iñuk quviasuutiqaqtuaq aitchuiñiġmik. "
6064," And God is able to make all grace overflow to you so that because you have enough of everything in every way at all times, you will overflow in every good work. ","Aasii God-im aitchuġumiñaġaasi agliḷugich supayaat pigiraksraġikkasi, ilivsi piqaġumiñaqsiḷusi ataramik naamasiḷugich pigiraksraġikkasi sippiġḷugich unnii, aitchuiqpakkumiñaqsiḷusi supayaanun savaaġiksuanun. "
6065," Just as it is written, “He has scattered widely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness remains forever.” ",Taavrumuuna aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna. Iñulluataq “aitchuiyumiñaġniaqtuq nagliktuutinik nauttaasuŋaġnagich iḷiappaŋnun. Ataramik inuaŋaiññiaqtuq nagliktuutiksraqaġumiñaġluni ataramik.” 
6066, Now God who provides seed for the sower and bread for food will provide and multiply your supply of seed and will cause the harvest of your righteousness to grow. ,"God-im aitchuiñiŋatun nautchiaksranik iñuŋmun nautchirriiruamun, aasii taapkunaŋŋa punniġmik niqiksramik, tainnatun suli piqaqtinniaġaasi pigiraksraġiravsiññik, sippakuulaaġluguunii pigiraksraqsi, ilivsi nauttaaŋaiġḷusi aitchuiyumiñaqsiḷusi allanun, taavrumuunaasii agliḷaaġlugu nagliktuiḷḷatutilaaqsi. "
6067," You will be enriched in every way so that you may be generous on every occasion, which is producing through us thanksgiving to God, ","Piḷḷuataqtitauniaqtusi supayaami, aitchuiyumiñaqsiḷusi nauttaaŋaiġḷusi. Aasii qaitkuptigik aitchuutisi, iñuich quyyatiqaqtinniaġisi God-mun. "
6068, because the service of this ministry is not only providing for the needs of the saints but is also overflowing with many thanks to God. ,"Qanuq aitchuiñiqsi piqaqtitchigiññaŋitchuq piiḷḷiuqtuanik ilaaguaqtauŋaruanik God-mun, aglaattauq iñugiaktuat quyyatiksriuġmigisi God-mun. "
6069, Through the evidence of this service they will glorify God because of your obedience to your confession in the gospel of Christ and the generosity of your sharing with them and with everyone. ,"Aitchuiñivsi nalupqinaiġñiaġaa iḷumun akuqtuŋatilaaŋa tusaayugaaġiksuaq Christ-kun aasii kamagivlugu.

6070, And in their prayers on your behalf they long for you because of the extraordinary grace God has shown to you. ,"Suli iliŋisa kasuġumaniaġaasi, aŋaiyyutilusiḷu pisigilugu aliuġnaqtuaq nagliktuutiqpaŋa God-im iḷuvsiññiittuaq. "
6071, Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!,"Quyyavigisiuŋ ilaan aitchuutiŋi pisigilugich, aliuġnaqpaił̣ł̣utiŋ uqalugianilgunaitchut."
6072," Now I, Paul, appeal to you personally by the meekness and gentleness of Christ (I who am meek when present among you, but am full of courage toward you when away!) – ","Uvaŋa Paul, araktuaġivsi taluġnaiqł̣uŋa suammatiŋaiqł̣usiḷu, Christ piḷġusiatun, uvaŋa uqautikkusiaqaġuuruaŋaa taluqsraliġuunivḷuŋa sivuġaŋiutikama ilivsiññun, aasii taluqsraiqł̣uŋa tuyuutimni ilivsiññun. "
6073, now I ask that when I am present I may not have to be bold with the confidence that (I expect) I will dare to use against some who consider us to be behaving according to human standards. ,Apiġigivsi iñuuniaġusiqaquŋił̣ł̣usi uvaŋa suammatilusi uqaluksraqaġumiñaqsisaġluŋa nayuqsiutiguma ilivsiññun.

6074," For though we live as human beings, we do not wage war according to human standards, ","Qanuq iñugruiññaugaluaŋŋaġma, atuŋitchuŋa iñugruiññauruam sivunniuġutiŋiñik piḷġusiŋiññiglu akimasaqama aŋuyaŋnimni. "
6075," for the weapons of our warfare are not human weapons, but are made powerful by God for tearing down strongholds. We tear down arguments ","Atuġiga God-im sapiġñaġniqsrauruaq suaŋŋataa akiiḷisaqługich iluqaisa tamatkua suaŋavlutiŋ akiḷḷiḷiqsuutiruat tusaayugaaġiksuamun, atuŋitchuŋa iñugruiññaum suaŋŋataanik. "
6076," and every arrogant obstacle that is raised up against the knowledge of God, and we take every thought captive to make it obey Christ. ","Sivuniġigiga una, uvaŋa qapiqtilaitchuŋa uqaġlaqutipayaani, iḷumun inŋitchuanullu isummatinun iñuich akiḷḷiḷiqsuutigisaasuukkaŋiññun iḷumun ittuanun God-ikun. Iñuich suksraaġipkallagitka iḷumun inŋitchuanik isummatiŋiññik, aasii kamagirraqsivḷugu Christ. "
6077," We are also ready to punish every act of disobedience, whenever your obedience is complete. ","Nalupqisuŋaiġuma iñugiagniqsrasi kamaksrirraqsisilaaŋannik, taqiŋaniaŋitchuŋa tatavsaġuglugich tamatkua kamasuutaitchuat."
6078," You are looking at outward appearances. If anyone is confident that he belongs to Christ, he should reflect on this again: Just as he himself belongs to Christ, so too do we. ","Qiñiqsigik tamatkua nalupqisuŋipiaġataqtuat Christ-mun tiliraġinivḷutiŋ.

6079," For if I boast somewhat more about our authority that the Lord gave us for building you up and not for tearing you down, I will not be ashamed of doing so. ","Uqavigaaġutigivaił̣aurallakkaluaġupkuunnii ataniġnaqutiga, aŋiuqsiyumiñaitchuŋa uqalumni.

6080," I do not want to seem as though I am trying to terrify you with my letters, ",Taamna uqallausiġigiga isumatquŋił̣ł̣usi iqsisaaqsiññaġasugalusi uvaŋa tuyuutipkun. 
6081," because some say, “His letters are weighty and forceful, but his physical presence is weak and his speech is of no account.” ","Qanuq iñuich uqaqtut, tuyuutiŋiavruma isumayuġaaġnaqtut suamarullu, aasii iñukpalliqami, irrusiqaaqsivḷuni sayaitchuatun alġaqsruiñiŋalu masaqsriñaipiaqtuq. "
6082," Let such a person consider this: What we say by letters when we are absent, we also are in actions when we are present.","Tainnatchit iñuich kaŋiqsiḷich tamatkua uqaluutigikkavut tuyuutitigun piiñŋapta, pisuummigivut nayuqsiutikapta."
6083," For we would not dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who recommend themselves. But when they measure themselves by themselves and compare themselves with themselves, they are without understanding. ","Iḷaliqsuutiyumaŋitchuŋa tamatkunuŋa iñuŋnun uqautiqaqtuanun qanutun nakuutilaamiŋnik. Tainnatchich iñuich iḷaksiatigiyumiñaitkitkaunnii naipiqtuutigisuglugich uvamnun. Qanuq uuktuutigiaqsikamiŋ avanmun, naipiqtuutigiaqsikamiglu, kaŋiqsisaitchut. "
6084," But we will not boast beyond certain limits, but will confine our boasting according to the limits of the work to which God has appointed us, that reaches even as far as you. ","Aglaan uqavigaaġniaŋitchuŋa taŋiġiḷamik, aglaan uqavigaaġutiginiaġiga ataniġnaqun God-im aitchuutaa uvamnun, ilivsi taputivlusi ataniġnaqunma. "
6085," For we were not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach as far as you, because we were the first to reach as far as you with the gospel about Christ. ",Taamna uqallausiġikapku qaaŋiulaaŋitchuŋa uqallakkama iḷaginivḷusi ataniġnaqutimni. Tikiutiqqaaŋagiga tusaayugaaġiksuaq Christ-kun ilivsiññun. 
6086," Nor do we boast beyond certain limits in the work done by others, but we hope that as your faith continues to grow, our work may be greatly expanded among you according to our limits, ","Uqautigivsi iḷumun ittuamik uvaŋa savaapkun, pimaaqtuŋitkitka allat iñuich savaaŋich uvaŋa savaaġiniḷugich.

6087," so that we may preach the gospel in the regions that lie beyond you, and not boast of work already done in another person’s area.

6089," For it is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person the Lord commends.","God-im akuqtulaitkaa nalliummatirualiḷugu iñuk uqaġiruaq inmiñik ilaan savaani nakuunivḷugich, aglaan iñuum savaaŋi nakuummata sivuġaani Atanġum."
6090," I wish that you would be patient with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you are being patient with me! ",Manimmiurallaquyumaruŋa ilivsiññun uqaġuma isumalluaġiitchuatun iñuktun uqavigaaqłuni. Apiġipiallakkivsi qanuqpallautigitquŋił̣ł̣uŋa. 
6091," For I am jealous for you with godly jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ. ","Uvaŋa siŋñagikavsi nalaunŋaruakun siŋñagigivsi, qanuq maqutauŋaitchuatun nuliaksrautitun ittusi, unniqsuqłiisigiŋakkaptun atautchimun uiksraunmun, Christ-mun. "
6092," But I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by his treachery, your minds may be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ. ","Siŋñagigivsi, anayasukłuŋa asiñuurraunasugalusi iḷumun ittuamiñ piviuttaqqunmiñ Christ-mun, Eve-tuttauq nimiġiam sagluqikkaŋatun pisaasuġmiaġunmigun. "
6093," For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus different from the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit than the one you received, or a different gospel than the one you accepted, you put up with it well enough! ","Irrusiqaqtusiuvva akuqtuiyumaiññaqtuatun qanusiḷimaamik iḷisaurrunmik, iñuk-unnii alġaqsruigaluaqpan allauruamik Jesus-mik, taavrumaŋŋa uvagut uqautigikkaptiŋniñ ilivsiññun.

6094, For I consider myself not at all inferior to those “super-apostles.” ,Isummatigiruŋa uvamnik qamalliuŋiññasugaluŋa supayaami tamatkunaŋŋa kamanaqtualiuqłutiŋ tilirauniruaniñ. 
6095," And even if I am unskilled in speaking, yet I am certainly not so in knowledge. Indeed, we have made this plain to you in everything in every way. ","Uqaqtualguitkaluaġuma, iḷisimaruŋaaglaan sumik uqaqtilaamnik, taamna iḷisimanaqsiŋagiga ilivsiññun nalunaiqł̣ugu suraġaġnipayaamni."
6096," Or did I commit a sin by humbling myself so that you could be exalted, because I proclaimed the gospel of God to you free of charge? ",Piḷuksivik kamanaiyaqama uvamnik ilivsi kamanaqsiḷaaqtautquvlusi? Kamanaiyaŋaruŋa uvamnik alġaqsruivḷuŋa God-im tusaayugaaġiksuaŋiñik ilivsiññun akiiḷḷiqsuġaluaġnasi.

6098," When I was with you and was in need, I was not a burden to anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia fully supplied my needs. I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and will continue to do so. ","Nayullavsi piiḷḷiuliqama, pamatquluŋa apiġiŋaitkiga kiñaliqaa, qanuq pigiraksraġikkatka pigipkaŋagaich aniqatit qairuat Macedonia-miñ.

6101," And what I am doing I will continue to do, so that I may eliminate any opportunity for those who want a chance to be regarded as our equals in the things they boast about.

6103," And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. ","Aasii aliuġnaitchuq, qanuq Satan unnii isaġulgatun qaummaum iḷiŋŋuaġuuruq. "
6104," Therefore it is not surprising his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness, whose end will correspond to their actions.

6115," I have been on journeys many times, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my own countrymen, in dangers from Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers from false brothers, ","akulaitchuani iglauniġni, navianniuġnani kuugni, iqsiññiuġniġmiḷu tigligayuktiqpaŋniñ, iqsiññiuġniġmiḷu nanmiñiq iñumniñ, iqsiññiuġniġmiḷu Jew-guŋitchuaniñ, iqsiññiuġniġmiḷu iniqpaŋmi, iqsiññiuġniġmiḷu nunagluktuami, navianniuġniġmiḷu taġiumi, iqsiññiuġniġmiḷu aniqatauŋŋuaqtuaniñ.

6121," In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to arrest me, ","Damascus-mi, kavana nalunaiqsaŋa umialgum Aretas munaqsriḷiŋagaa iniqpaŋa Damascus tigusukkaluaqłuŋa. "

6123," It is necessary to go on boasting. Though it is not profitable, I will go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. ","Uqavigaaqsalguniq iluqani anniqsuutauŋitkaluaqtillugu, uqavigaaqtuavsaallaktuksrauruŋa. Quliaqtuaġutilavsi qiñiqtuuraamnik puttuqsripkausiamniglu Ataniġmiñ. "
6124," I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago (whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows) was caught up to the third heaven. ","Akimiaġuutaiḷaq ukiuq pianiktuq mayuurrauŋaqqaaqtilluŋa qiḷaum iḷaŋanun. Nalummiuŋa timilgiqsilaamnik naagga timiga qimakługu, God iḷisimaruq. "

6127," On behalf of such an individual I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except about my weaknesses. ","Tainnasiq qiñiqtuuraaq uqavigaaġutauyumiñaġaluaqtuq, aglaan uvaŋa uqavigaaġutiginiaŋitkiga. Uqavigaaġutigiłhaiññaġniaġitka suaŋairrutitka. "
6128," For even if I wish to boast, I will not be a fool, for I would be telling the truth, but I refrain from this so that no one may regard me beyond what he sees in me or what he hears from me, ","Aasiivsauq uqavigaaġukkuma, isumalluaġiiġḷuŋa piñiaŋiñmiuŋa, qanuq uqautiqaġniaqtuŋa iḷumun ittuamik.

6129," even because of the extraordinary character of the revelations. Therefore, so that I would not become arrogant, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to trouble me – so that I would not become arrogant. ","Suli pitchaiḷisaqłuŋa kamasaaqpaił̣ł̣aunmiñ iñugiaktuatigun qiñiqtuuraatigun, aitchuusiaqaŋaruŋa iłuiḷḷiuġunmik, kapuaġutitun ittuamik timimni.

6131," But he said to me, “My grace is enough for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” So then, I will boast most gladly about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may reside in me. ","Aasii ilaan uqallautiŋagaaŋa, “Uvaŋa nagliktuutiqpaga naamaruq iliŋnun, qanuq uvaŋa suaŋŋatiga iḷisimanammaġiksisuuruq kivgamni iliŋich suaŋaiḷimmata.” Taamna pisigivlugu, sugiŋitkiga iłuiḷḷiuġun pigigupku piiġñiŋaniñ.

6140," I urged Titus to visit you and I sent our brother along with him. Titus did not take advantage of you, did he? Did we not conduct ourselves in the same spirit?

6150," not that there really is another gospel, but there are some who are disturbing you and wanting to distort the gospel of Christ. ","Allamik tusaayugaaġiksuamik piitkaluaġmiuq aglaan iñuich iḷaŋisa alapitinniaqsaagaasi, allaŋŋuqtiġniaqsaavlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq Christ-kun. "

6153," Am I now trying to gain the approval of people, or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be a slave of Christ!

6154," Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that the gospel I preached is not of human origin. ","Aniqatiit, iḷisimatqugivsi. Tamanna tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutigikkaġa iñuŋniñ piŋitchuq, "
6155, For I did not receive it or learn it from any human source; instead I received it by a revelation of Jesus Christ. ,"qanuq aitchuusiaġiŋitkiga iñuŋmiñ, naagga iḷisausiaġiŋitkiga, aglaan Jesus Christ satqummiŋagaa uvamnun. "
6156," For you have heard of my former way of life in Judaism, how I was savagely persecuting the church of God and trying to destroy it. ","Tusaaŋagiksi qanusiuŋatilaaġa iñuk iñuuŋŋaġma Jew-guruatun, annagniaqsaaruatun kamagivlugich pitqurat.

6157," I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my nation, and was extremely zealous for the traditions of my ancestors. ","Kipiġniupiaġataŋaruŋa iñuusukłuŋa tuvraġlugich iḷisaurrutiŋich maŋŋuupta, aasii qaukłiġuutivluŋa qaaŋiqł̣ugich ukiuqtutilaaqatitka iñuuniġmi Jew-guruatun. "
6158, But when the one who set me apart from birth and called me by his grace was pleased ,"Aglaalli God sivuniqaŋaniqsuq aniŋaiñŋaġmaunnii ilaan alġaqsruirigisukłuŋa. Aasii aquvatigun, nagliktuutinikpakami uvamnun, "
6159," to reveal his Son in me so that I could preach him among the Gentiles, I did not go to ask advice from any human being, ","satqummiŋagaa Iġñini uvamnun, alġaqsruutiqaġumiñaqsivḷuŋa Christ-mik Jew-guŋitchuanun. Taimaniasii uqaqatiqaŋaitchuŋa kimigliqaa iñuŋmik, "
6160," nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me, but right away I departed to Arabia, and then returned to Damascus.","naaggaunnii Jerusalem-muŋaitchuŋa uqaqatigiyaqtuġlugich God-mun tilirauvlutiŋ alġaqsruiriġuŋaruanun sivumni, aglaan aullaŋaruŋa nunamun Arabia-mun, aasii aquvatigun utiqłuŋa iniqpaŋanun Damascus. "
6161," Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and get information from him, and I stayed with him fifteen days. ","Aasii ukiut piŋasut pianiŋmata, aullaŋaruŋa Jerusalem-mun takuvlugu Cephas, aasii itqatigivlugu akimiani uvluni. "
6162, But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord’s brother. ,"Aglaan tautuŋiñmigitka nalliat-unnii allat tiliraunikun alġaqsruirit aglaan James, Atanġum aniqataa."
6163," I assure you that, before God, I am not lying about what I am writing to you! ","Tuyuutigikkamni ilivsiññun, sivuġaani God-im sagluŋitchuŋa. "
6164, Afterward I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. ,Tavraŋŋa aullaŋaruŋa nunaŋiñun Syria-m Cilicia-vlu. 
6165, But I was personally unknown to the churches of Judea that are in Christ. ,Aasii tamauŋanun aglaan aŋaiyyuliqiruaŋisa Christ Judea-mi tautuŋaitkaanŋa. 
6166," They were only hearing, “The one who once persecuted us is now proclaiming the good news of the faith he once tried to destroy.” ","Tusaqsraġigiññaŋagaat iñuich uqautaat, Taimña qaŋauvlugu nagliksaaqtitchiruaq uvaptiŋnik suksraunġiġñiaqsaavlugu ukpiġikkaŋat paŋmapak alġaqsruiruq iñuich ukpiquvlugich Christ-mun. "
6167, So they glorified God because of me.,Aasii pisigivluŋa ilaisa God nanġaŋagaat.
6168," Then after fourteen years I went up to Jerusalem again with Barnabas, taking Titus along too. ","Tavra akimiaġuutaiḷat ukiut pianiŋmata, aullatqiŋaruŋa Jerusalem-mun piqatigivlugu Barnabas, Titus piqatigivluguptauq. "
6169," I went there because of a revelation and presented to them the gospel that I preach among the Gentiles. But I did so only in a private meeting with the influential people, to make sure that I was not running – or had not run – in vain. ","Aullaŋaruŋa qanuq God-im aullaquŋagaaŋa, aasii sivuniqsipkaġniaŋagiga taapkunuŋa aŋaiyyuliqiruani sivulliuqtauruanun, tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutigikkaġa Jew-guŋitchuanun. Uqaqatigiŋagitka iñuił̣aami sivulliuqtauruat, iḷaanni savaurriñiġa God-mik anniqsuutauniaŋiññasugalugu. "
6170," Yet not even Titus, who was with me, was compelled to be circumcised, although he was a Greek. ","Titus unnii, Jew-guŋitchuaq piqatigikkaġa Jerusalem-mi, nalunaiñŋutchigaksraiñŋaruq Jew-guruatun, piḷaktauluni timimigun. "
6171," Now this matter arose because of the false brothers with false pretenses who slipped in unnoticed to spy on our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, to make us slaves. ","Piḷaktugaksrauniḷuguunnii, isumman nivliusiġinaġayaitchuq unnii tamatkua iḷumutun ukpiqtuaguŋitchuat nalunaqtuakun qaġġirauŋaitpata aŋaiyyuliqiruanun, suiḷaurivḷutiŋ piqasiutiruat kasimaniptiŋnun nalunautchiḷutiŋ iḷitchuġisuktuat atanġirrutiptiŋnik Jew-guruat pitquraŋiññiñ, ukpiliqaptaqaŋa Christ-mun.

6172," But we did not surrender to them even for a moment, in order that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.","Aglaan aŋiġuraŋitchugut unnii pipkaġniapiakkaŋannun, iñuuyumiñaquvlusi tuvraġlugu iḷumun tusaayugaaġiksuaq."
6173, But from those who were influential (whatever they were makes no difference to me; God shows no favoritism between people) – those influential leaders added nothing to my message. ,"Aasiivsauq taapkua iḷisimanaqsiŋaruat sivulliuqtautilaaŋat aŋaiyyuliqiruanun, sumik iḷḷatiksraiñŋarut tusaayugaaġiksuamun alġaqsruutigikkamnun. Uvamnun taapkua sivulliuqtit inmiut allatun iñuktitun, God atiruq iñupayaanun. "
6174," On the contrary, when they saw that I was entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised just as Peter was to the circumcised ","Aglaalli iḷagaluaġnagu tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutigikkaġa, sivulliuqtauruat puttuqsriŋarut piksraqtaaguŋatilaamnik alġaqsruutigitquvlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq Jew-guŋitchuanun, Peter-tun piksraqtaaġuŋaruatun alġaqsruitquvlugu tusaayugaaġiksuamik Jew-guruanun, "
6175, (for he who empowered Peter for his apostleship to the circumcised also empowered me for my apostleship to the Gentiles) ,"qanuq God-im annaurriŋaruam iñugiaktuanik Jew-guruanik Peter alġaqsruimman, annautiŋammigaivsauq iñugiaktuat Jew-guŋitchuat uvaŋa alġaqsruiñipkun. "
6176," and when James, Cephas, and John, who had a reputation as pillars, recognized the grace that had been given to me, they gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we would go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised. ","Tavra James-lu Cephas-lu John-lu suaŋavlutiŋ sivulliuqtauniqsuat, puttuqsrikamiŋ God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋanik uvamnun, aitchuqłuŋa taavrumiŋa savaamik, iḷisimanaqsiŋagaat ikayuqtigiiksilaaptiŋnik iḷalivḷunuk, uvaŋalu Barnabas-lu, atisivḷutiŋ alġaqsruitquvlunuk kiikaa Jew-guŋitchuanun, iliŋiḷḷi alġaqsruiñiaġnivḷutik-suli Jew-guruanun. "
6177," They requested only that we remember the poor, the very thing I also was eager to do.","Aglaatualuk itqaumatqugaatiguk iḷiappauruanik, taamnapiaġataq piyumalaaġmiraġa."
6178," But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he had clearly done wrong. ","Qakugumman, Cephas Antioch-muŋman, paaqłakkiga takkuanun, qanuq killukuaŋaruq. "
6179," Until certain people came from James, he had been eating with the Gentiles. But when they arrived, he stopped doing this and separated himself because he was afraid of those who were pro-circumcision. ","Aasiuvva inna Peter killukuaŋaruq. Iḷaŋich avilaitqatiŋi James tikiñ ŋaiñŋaisa, Peter niġiqatausuuŋaruq Jew-guŋitchuanun, kipuqłakługich Jew-guruat pitquraŋich.

6180," And the rest of the Jews also joined with him in this hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was led astray with them by their hypocrisy. ","Allattauq Jew-guruat maliksuŋagaat Peter, iḷisimanaqsivḷugu tuniqsimapiaŋisilaaqtiŋ iḷumun ittuamun iḷitchuġikkaġmiŋnun. Barnabasunnii niġiqataullaiŋaruq Jew-guŋitchuanun. "
6181," But when I saw that they were not behaving consistently with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas in front of them all, “If you, although you are a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you try to force the Gentiles to live like Jews?”","Iḷitchuġikapkich iñuuvigiŋiññiġmarruŋ iḷumun ittuaŋa tusaayugaaġiksuam, uqallautiŋagiga Peter iluqaġmiŋ takkuanni inna.

6182," We are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners, ","Uvagut, aniŋaruaguut Jew-guvluta, Jew-guŋitchuat taisuukkavut piḷuusiqirinik, "
6183," yet we know that no one is justified by the works of the law but by the faithfulness of Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we may be justified by the faithfulness of Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified. ","uvagut Jew-guruaguut, iḷisimarugut God-im akuqtulaitkaa iñuk nalaunŋarualiḷugu sivuqqamiñi pisigilugu kamaksriñiataŋniŋa ilaan pitquramiñik qaisauruanik Moses-kun.

"
6184," But if while seeking to be justified in Christ we ourselves have also been found to be sinners, is Christ then one who encourages sin? Absolutely not! ","Isummatigilakput una.

6185," But if I build up again those things I once destroyed, I demonstrate that I am one who breaks God’s law. ","Qanuq uvaŋa, iñuuniarraqsitqikkuma kamaksriñikun pitquranik nalaunŋasiñiatagluŋa, ukpilianiŋaqqaaġluŋa Christ-mun, iḷisimanaqsiruŋa piḷuusiqirautilaamnik, "

6187," I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So the life I now live in the body, I live because of the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. ","Tuquruatun pitquranun piuŋa, qanuq Christ kikiaktuurraumman kikiaktuurrauqatauruatun piŋaruŋa. Nalaunŋaruakun iñuuniaġusiġa pitquratiguaqtuaq tuqummatun piŋaruq.

6188," I do not set aside God’s grace, because if righteousness could come through the law, then Christ died for nothing!","Ukpiġivlugu taamna, God nagliktuutiqpaŋa anniqsuutauŋaiŋitkiga, qanuq iñuk nalaunŋasiḷḷakpan sivuġaani God-im kamagigiññaġlugich pitqurat, Christ asiñun tuquŋaniqsuq."
6189, You foolish Galatians! Who has cast a spell on you? Before your eyes Jesus Christ was vividly portrayed as crucified! ,"Ilivsi isumalaaŋitchuasii Galatians, kia alapititpasi? Uqaluuruat kikiaktuurrauniŋagun Jesus Christ nalunaipiaqługich alġaqsruutauŋagaluaqtut ilivsiññun. "
6190, The only thing I want to learn from you is this: Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of the law or by believing what you heard? ,"Apiġilavsi uumiŋa.

6191," Are you so foolish? Although you began with the Spirit, are you now trying to finish by human effort? ","Nalupqinaitchuamik isumalaaŋisigiyumiñaitchusi, isumallasiḷusi iñuk aitchuusiaqaŋaruq isuitchuamik iñuggunmik Ilitqusiġiksuamiñ, nakuułhaaġluni ukpiqtuaguyumiñaġniḷugu iñuuluni pitquratigun. "
6192, Have you suffered so many things for nothing? – if indeed it was for nothing. ,"Nalupqinaitchuamik, iluqaġmiŋ nagliksaaqtirrusiasi piuŋiḷauŋaitchut. "
6193, Does God then give you the Spirit and work miracles among you by your doing the works of the law or by your believing what you heard? ,"God-im iñuupkaŋagaa Ilitqusiġiksuaq iḷuvsiññi, aasii aliuġnaqtuat savaaġipkaqługich akunnavsiññi, qanuq ukpiġiŋagiksi alġaqsruutauruaq ilivsiññun, pisigiŋaiqł̣ugu iñuuniatagniqsi nalaunŋaruakun sivuġaani God-im kamaksriñikun pitquranik."
6194," Just as Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness, ","Bible-niñ iḷitchumiñaġikput taamna qanuq aglausimaruq inna, “Abraham ukpiġiŋagaa God, aasii taamna pisigivlugu God-im akuqtuŋagaa ilaa nalaunŋarualivḷugu.” "
6195," so then, understand that those who believe are the sons of Abraham. ","Taavrumuuna kaŋiqsiyumiñaqtusi, iñuich ukpiqtuat Abraham ukpiġusiatun, nanmiñiq miqłiqtuġimmatun itkai, kiŋuniġipiaŋitkaluaŋŋaisa. "
6196," And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, proclaimed the gospel to Abraham ahead of time, saying, “All the nations will be blessed in you.” ","Aasiisuli piŋaisaktaŋŋaan, Bible satqummiŋagaat God-mun akuqtuġumaaġnivḷugich Jew-guŋitchuat nalaunŋarualiḷugich pisigilugu ukpiġutaat, qanuq God-im uqautiŋagaa Abraham tusaayugaaġiksuanik uqallautikamiuŋ, “Quviasuutiqaqtinniaġitka nunapayaani ukpiliqsuat uvamnun iliktuttauq ukpiqpata.” "
6197, So then those who believe are blessed along with Abraham the believer. ,Tavra iñuich ukpiliqsuat Abraham-tun quviasaaġusiaqaġmiut piqatigivlugu Abraham ukpiŋaruaq.
6198," For all who rely on doing the works of the law are under a curse, because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who does not keep on doing everything written in the book of the law.” ","Iluqaġmiŋ iñuich akuqtullasipkaġniaqsaaruat nalaunŋarualiḷutiŋ sivuġaani God-im kamagilugich pitquraŋi pasiñaqtut, aasii tuqulutiŋ, qanuq aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna, “Pasirauruq nalliummatiruġlu tuqqunmun kiñaliqaa iñuutuiññaŋitchuaq kamagilugich iluqapayauraŋisa aglausimaruat pitqurat.” "
6199," Now it is clear no one is justified before God by the law, because the righteous one will live by faith. ","Paŋmapak nalupqinaiqsuq iñupayaaq nalaunŋasiyumiñaisilaaŋanik sivuġaani God-im kamaginiḷugich pitqurat, qanuq aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna, “Iñuk ukpiġunmigun nalaunŋasirauruaq iñuuniaqtuq.” "
6200," But the law is not based on faith, but the one who does the works of the law will live by them. ","Akiḷḷiali taavruma uqaluum, iñuk iñuuruaq pitquratigun ukpiġutituaksraitchuq, qanuq Bible-ni aglausimaruq inna, “Iñuk iñuuniaqtuq kisianik kamagituiññaġlugich iluqaisa pitqurat, suuramikunnii kipuqłasuŋaġnagich.” "
6201," Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us (because it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree”) ","Uvagut pasiraugaluaqtilluta tuquruksrauvluta kamagilaił̣ł̣ugich God-im pitquraŋi, Christ tasuŋagaatigut pivḷugu ilaan uvagut tatavsausiaksraqput, qanuq Bible-ni aglausimaruq inna, “Pasirauruq tuquruksrauruġlu iñupayaaq kikiaktuurrauruaq napaaqtumun.” "
6202," in order that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham would come to the Gentiles, so that we could receive the promise of the Spirit by faith.","Aasii taamna Christ Jesus pimmagu Jew-guŋitchuat annaurrauyumiñaqsirut ukpiġutikun Abraham-tun, aasiisuli ukpiġutikun aitchuusiaqallasivḷuta Ilitqusiġiksuamik unniqsuqłiisauŋaruamik."
6203," Brothers and sisters, I offer an example from everyday life: When a covenant has been ratified, even though it is only a human contract, no one can set it aside or add anything to it. ","Aniqatiit, uvva uuktuutauyumiñaqtuaq iñuŋniŋŋaqtaq. Iñuk unniqsuqłiimman aglautivlugu suli nalupqinaiyausiqł̣ugu atchiivigivlugu, kialiqaa asivaġumiñaitkaa naagga allaŋŋuġumiñaitkaalu taamna unniqsuqłiiñ. "
6204," Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. Scripture does not say, “and to the descendants,” referring to many, but “and to your descendant,” referring to one, who is Christ. ","Tavra God-im unniqsuqłiisigiŋagaa quviasaaġusiaq Abraham-mun kiŋuniŋanullu. Una nalunaigilugu. Unniqsuqłiiñ quviasaaġusiakun unniqsuqłiisauŋaitchuq iñugiaktuanun kiŋuniġiiñun, aglaan atausisualuŋmun kiŋunġuruamun, aasii taamna kiŋunġuruaq Christ-guruq. "
6205," What I am saying is this: The law that came four hundred thirty years later does not cancel a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to invalidate the promise. ","Uvva sivuniġikkaġa. God-im pitquraŋi aitchuutauŋarut 430 ukiut pianiŋmata nalupqinaiyausianiqqaaqtillugu ilaan unniqsuqłiisaa Abraham-mun.

6206," For if the inheritance is based on the law, it is no longer based on the promise, but God graciously gave it to Abraham through the promise.","Qanuq unniqsuqłiisauruaq quviasaaġusiaksraq annaun aitchuusiagullakpan kamaksriñiq pitquranik pisigilugu, aitchuusiaġinaġumiñai ŋaruq unniqsuqłiisikun. Aglaatkii God-im aitchuutigiŋagaa Abraham-mun unniqsuqłiisikun."
6207," Why then was the law given? It was added because of transgressions, until the arrival of the descendant to whom the promise had been made. It was administered through angels by an intermediary. ","Tamatkua tainnainniġmata, summan pitqurat aitchuutauŋavat?

Pitqurat aitchuutauŋarut isaġuliktigun, iñukullu pirriruakun Moses-kun. "
6208," Now an intermediary is not for one party alone, but God is one. ","Pisinniŋniq iñuŋnik piraksraġuġman, taamna sivuniqaqtuq iññuk malġuk atilutik uqaqtuksrauvlugik unniqsuqłiisikun. Aglaalli God-im unniqsuqłiikamiuŋ Abraham annaunmik, pirituŋaitchuq, inmiñik kisimi piŋagaa."
6209," Is the law therefore opposed to the promises of God? Absolutely not! For if a law had been given that was able to give life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. ","Taamna tainnainman, pitqurat paaqsaaŋavat God-im unniqsuqłiisiŋiñun? Naaggapiaġataq. Qanuq pitqurat aitchuutauŋakpata taimuŋa iñuullasiḷḷalugich iñuich, nalaunŋasiraunaġayaqtuq sivuġaani God-im pitquratigun. "
6210, But the scripture imprisoned everything and everyone under sin so that the promise could be given – because of the faithfulness of Jesus Christ – to those who believe.,"Aglaan uvva, uqallautiŋagaatigut Bible-ni iñupayaurat piḷuksiŋanivḷugich qanuq kamagilaił̣ł̣ugich God-im pitquraŋi. Paŋmapak-aasii tamatkua ukpiqtuat Jesus Christ-mun aitchuusiaqaqtut unniqsuqłiisauŋaruamik iñuggunmik isuitchuamik."
6211," Now before faith came we were held in custody under the law, being kept as prisoners until the coming faith would be revealed. ","Christ qaiŋaiñŋaan isiqtaġimmatun piŋagaatigut satqummiqsauvlutiŋ pitqurat aitchuutauruat Moses-kun. Taapkua pitqurat qaunaksrimmatun piŋarut uvaptiŋnik Christ satqummiġñiŋanunaglaan, annaurrauyumiñaqsiḷġataqtilluta ilaagun. "
6212," Thus the law had become our guardian until Christ, so that we could be declared righteous by faith. ","Qaunaksri munaqsrimmatun miqłiqtunik ataniġnaqutiqaqłuni kamaksripkallavlugich iñuguġataqtillugich, tainnatulli pitqurat qaunagiŋagaatigut Christ qaiñiŋanunaglaan, nalaunŋasipkaqtaullasiḷġataġluta ukpiġluta Christ-mun. "
6213," But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. ",Aasii paŋmapak ukpiġumiñaqsikapta Christ-mun munaqsrituŋaiqsugut pitquranik.
6214, For in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God through faith. ,"Qanuq atausiŋŋuqatigikavsiuŋ Christ Jesus ukpiġutikun, iluqasi aglianiŋarusi iġñiŋi God-im. "
6215, For all of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. ,"Iluqasi atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruasii Christ-mun, paptaiqsauŋavlusi, ilaatun iḷiŋarusi. "
6216," There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female – for all of you are one in Christ Jesus. ","Tavra iluqasi atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruasii Christ Jesus-mun, atirusi iluqasi. Allagiiŋitchut Jew-guruallu Greek-giḷḷu, kivgallu kivgauŋitchuallu, aŋutillu aġnallu, iluqaġmiŋ atirut. "
6217," And if you belong to Christ, then you are Abraham’s descendants, heirs according to the promise.","Tavraasii pigimmasi Christ, Abraham kiŋuniġigaasi, suli ilaan kiŋuvaannaktigigaasi, kiŋuvaannaktaaġilugu unniqsuqłiisiaŋa."
6218," Now I mean that the heir, as long as he is a minor, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything. ","Sivuniġikkaġa kiŋuvaannaktuagunivḷusi uqallakama innaittuq. Kiŋuvaannaktuksraun miqłiqtuuŋŋaġmi, kivgatuttauq inmiuq iñuqaġaluaŋŋaisaunnii inmiñun iluqaġmiŋ aapami suġaliŋi. "
6219, But he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father. ,"Aasii ilaa qaunaksriqaqłuni munaqsriñik aŋalatchiriñiglu suġaliġmiñik, tikitchiaġivlugu kiŋuvaannagviksrautini, aapami nalunaiŋakkaŋiñik. "
6220," So also we, when we were minors, were enslaved under the basic forces of the world. ","Tainnatuttauq uvagut. Christ qaiŋaiñŋaan miqłiqtutun inŋagaluaġmiugut, munaqsriqaqłuta pitquranik iñugruiññaiḷḷu piḷġusiġikkaŋiññik nakuurualiqinikun, kivgaummatun iłłuta tamatkunuŋa. "
6221," But when the appropriate time had come, God sent out his Son, born of a woman, born under the law, ","Aglaan God-im nalunaiqsani piviksraq tikiñman, tiliŋagaa Iġñini nunam iñuŋiñun. Christ aniŋaruq aġnakun, Jew-guvluni, kamaksriruksrauvluni pitquranik, "
6222," to redeem those who were under the law, so that we may be adopted as sons with full rights. ","sunauvva tasuġukługich tamatkua aŋalatittuat pitquranun, uvagut agliraksraiŋaluta iġñiġitquvluta God-mun, aitchuusiaqaġumiñaqsiḷuta kiŋuvaannaktaksraptiŋnik God-miñ."
6223," And because you are sons, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, who calls “Abba! Father!” ","Aasii agliraksraiqł̣uta God-im iġñiġiniġmatigut, ilaan tiliŋagaa Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa Iġñiġmi iḷuptiŋnun, iḷitchuġipkairuaq uvaptiŋnik God iḷumun nanmiñiq aapagitilaaŋanik. "
6224," So you are no longer a slave but a son, and if you are a son, then you are also an heir through God.","Tavraasii, God-im iġñiġiliutiŋagaasi suli kiŋuvaannaktuksraġuqłusi, aasii kivgatun inŋaiŋarusi."
6225," Formerly when you did not know God, you were enslaved to beings that by nature are not gods at all. ","Taimani iḷitchuġiŋaiñŋavsi God-mik, kivgauŋagaluaqtusi isummatigikkavsiññun god-aunasugalugich. "
6226," But now that you have come to know God (or rather to be known by God), how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless basic forces? Do you want to be enslaved to them all over again? ","Aglaan paŋmapak iḷitchuġiŋagiksi God, naaggałhaaq God-im iḷitchuġiŋagaasi, summan aasii utiġukpisi aŋalatiqavsaaġniġmun pitquranik, iñugruiññaiḷḷu piḷġusiŋiññun nakuurualiqinikun, annaurriyumiñaitchuanun ilivsiññik?

6227, You are observing religious days and months and seasons and years. ,"Summan iviġagniatakpisiuŋ God piqutiqaqłusi ilaaguaqtanik niqinaqiviŋñik uvlunik, ilaaguaqtaniglu tatqiñik, suli ilaaguaqtanik niqinaqiviŋñik ukiuniglu. "
6228, I fear for you that my work for you may have been in vain. ,Anayasuktuŋa siġġaqutiginasugalusi asiñun.

6230," But you know it was because of a physical illness that I first proclaimed the gospel to you, ",sivulliġmi alġaqsruiqqaaqama tusaayugaaġiksuanik Christ-kun ilivsiññun. Ullaŋagivsi pisigivlugu timimi qilluusiqsauŋaniġa. 
6231," and though my physical condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. Instead, you welcomed me as though I were an angel of God, as though I were Christ Jesus himself! ","Aasii qilluutituġniġa iviġaumanaitkaluaqtillugu ilivsiññun, naġġugiŋaitkivsiŋa, kipagiluŋalu suuŋiḷaġiluŋalu piŋaitkivsiŋa, aglaan paġlaŋagivsiŋa quyavlusi, isaġuliktun-unnii iḷivḷuŋa, naaggaunnii Christ Jesus-tun.

6232," Where then is your sense of happiness now? For I testify about you that if it were possible, you would have pulled out your eyes and given them to me! ","Taimani qanutun quviasuktigiŋarusi.

6234," They court you eagerly, but for no good purpose; they want to exclude you, so that you would seek them eagerly. ","Tamatkua iḷumun inŋitchuanik iḷisaurrich iviġaumagiliqsinniataktut ilivsiññun, aglaan sivuniqaŋitchut nakuuruamik, qanuq niguqtinniaqsaagaasi uvamniñ, isummatigilluatallasitquvlutiŋ ilivsiññun. "

6239," For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the slave woman and the other by the free woman. ","Bible-ni aglausimaruq Abraham malġugnik iġñiqaġnivḷugu, igḷua kivgauruakun aġnakun, aasii igḷua nuliaŋagun atanniqsimaraitchuakun. "
6240," But one, the son by the slave woman, was born by natural descent, while the other, the son by the free woman, was born through the promise. ","Kivgauruam iġñiŋa aniŋaruq piḷġusikaatun, aglaan nuliaŋata iġñiŋa aniŋaruq kisianik God-im unniqsuqłiisigianigmagu aniñiagnivḷugu. "
6241," These things may be treated as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai bearing children for slavery; this is Hagar. ","Taapkuŋniŋa uuktuutiqaqta. Taapkuak aġnak malġuk ittuk God-im malġuktun sivunniuġutiktun iñuŋmiñun. Sivunniuġutaata igḷua iñuŋmiñun piŋaruq iġġimi Sinai-mi, God-im aitchuġmagich qulinik pitquranik.

6242," Now Hagar represents Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. ","Tavra Hagar iġġisun Sinai-tun ittuq, Arabia-mi ittuami, suli arrilisauyumiñaqtuq iniqpaktun Jerusalem-tun, qanuq Jew-guruat tavrani aŋalatiqaqtut pitquranik, aitchuutauŋaruanik Moses-kun Sinai-mi.

6243," But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. ","Aglaalli uvagut aimaaġvikput Jerusalem-tun ittuq paŋmaniittuaq, qiḷak. Taamna-suli aakagimmatun itkikput iluqata ukpiqtuaguut Christ-mun, atanġiqsitauŋaruaguut, kivgauŋaiqł̣uta pitquranun. "
6244, For it is written:,Taamna aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna.

6247,because the children of the desolate woman are more numerous,"Taavrumuuna inna aglausimaruq Bible-ni. God-im uqallautiŋagaa Abraham, “Anirruŋ kivgaq iġñiŋalu, qanuq kivgauruam iġñiŋa iḷaŋiutiniaŋitchuq kiŋuvaannaktaaksraunmun piqatigilugu atanġitchuam aġnam iġñiŋa.” "

6249," But you, brothers and sisters, are children of the promise like Isaac. ",
6250," But just as at that time the one born by natural descent persecuted the one born according to the Spirit, so it is now. ",
6251," But what does the scripture say? “Throw out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the son” of the free woman. ",
6252," Therefore, brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.",
6253," For freedom Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not be subject again to the yoke of slavery. ","Nalupqinaitchuq, Christ iḷumun atanġiqsinŋagaatigut. Tavraasii iñuusitchisuli atanġiqsitauŋaruatun iñuktun. Utiġnasi iñuuniaġniġmun Jew-guruat pitquraŋisigun annautigisuglugich. "

6255, And I testify again to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. ,"Uqallautivsaalgitkivsi. Iñuk nalunaiñŋutchiqsaukami, kamaksriruksraupiaġataqtuq iluqaiññik pitquranik aitchuutauŋaruanik Moses-kun. "

6257," For through the Spirit, by faith, we wait expectantly for the hope of righteousness. ","Qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam ikayuutaagun, uvagullu ukpiġutiqaqtuiññaġniptigun Christ-mun, niġiuktugut suli akuqtuġniaġnivḷuta God-mun nalaunŋarualiḷuta. "
6258, For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision carries any weight – the only thing that matters is faith working through love.,"Niġiugikaptigu nalaunŋasipkaqtauniksraqput Christ-kun, nalunaiñŋutchiqsauniq Jew-guruatun naagga nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaiññiq anniqsuutauŋitchuq uvaptiŋnun, aglaan ukpiġun kisimi piviuttaqsripkairuaq allanun uvaptiŋnik."

6263," Now, brothers and sisters, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.

Ilaan sivunniuġutigiŋakkaŋa iḷisimanaŋaitkaluaqtuaq sivuani, Christ-gum paŋmapak taŋŋiŋagaa. "
6288," toward the administration of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ – the things in heaven and the things on earth. ","Aasiuvva God-im sivunniuġutigiŋakkaŋa, piviksraq nalautitpan supayaat ilaan savaani atautchimuquvlugich piqatigilugu Christ Atanġuruaq supayaanun, sut qiḷaŋmiitkaluaqpata, naagga nunamiitkaluaqpata."
6289," In Christ we too have been claimed as God’s own possession, since we were predestined according to the one purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will ","Atausiŋŋuqataukapta Christ-mun, kiŋuvaannaŋarugut iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. Taamna piŋaruq God-im sivuniġiŋavlugu tainna piruksrauvlugu. Ilaan nalautitchuugai ataramik sivunniuġutini. "
6290," so that we, who were the first to set our hope on Christ, would be to the praise of his glory. ","Taamna pisigilugu, uvagut Jew-guruat ukpiqqaaqtuaguut Christ-mun iñuuruksraurugut iḷisimanaqsisaġlugu qanutun God-im kamanaqtilaaŋa, iñuŋnun nanġaġumiñaqsiḷugu. "
6291," And when you heard the word of truth (the gospel of your salvation) – when you believed in Christ – you were marked with the seal of the promised Holy Spirit, ","Sulivsauq ilivsi, tusaaganikavsiuŋ uqaluk iḷumun ittuaq, tusaayugaaġiksuaq annautikun, suli ukpiġivlugu, Ilitqusiġiksuam unniqsuqłiisauŋaruam nalunaiñŋutchiŋagaasi, God-mun pigiliutivlusi. "
6292," who is the down payment of our inheritance, until the redemption of God’s own possession, to the praise of his glory. ","Tavraasii nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋavlusi pigiliutivlusi God-mun, nalupqisukkumiñaitchusi annaurrautilaavsiññik paŋmapaŋmiñ qiḷaŋmugataġlusi. Pisigilugu taamna, iluqaġmiŋ iñuich nanġaġlirruŋ God kamanautaagun."
6293," For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, ","Taamna pisigivlugu, tusaaŋavluŋa ukpiġutivsiññik Ataniġmun Jesus-mun suli piviuttaqqutivsiññik iluqaiññun ilaaguaqtauruanun God-mun, "
6294, I do not cease to give thanks for you when I remember you in my prayers. ,"quyaŋaiyuitchuŋa ilivsigun God-mun, itqaumavlusi aŋaiyyutimni. "
6295," I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you spiritual wisdom and revelation in your growing knowledge of him, ","Apiġigiga God-iŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ, kamanaqtuaq Aapa, puttuqsritquvlusi ilaan isumattutaanik, ilivsiññun God iḷitchuġimmaġiksitquvlugu. "
6296," – since the eyes of your heart have been enlightened – so that you may know what is the hope of his calling, what is the wealth of his glorious inheritance in the saints, ","Suli apiġigiga God iḷitchuġipkaquvlusi nalupqigiŋaiġḷugu annagumman taavrumuŋa God-im ququaŋammasi, suli iḷitchuġilugu inuaŋaiññiŋa kamanautim, God-im ilaaguaqtaŋisa kiŋuvaannaktaaġiniakkaŋat. "
6297," and what is the incomparable greatness of his power toward us who believe, as displayed in the exercise of his immense strength. ",Apiġivsaaġmigiga God iḷitchuġipkaquvlusi qanutun kamanapiaġataqtilaaŋanik ilaan suaŋŋataa ikayuġumiñaqłuta ukpiqtuaguruaguut. 
6298, This power he exercised in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realms ,"Taavrumuuna kamanapiaġataqtuakun suaŋŋatikun God-im aŋipkaŋagaa Christ tuqqunmiñ, aasii aquvitiłługu kamanaqsipkaqtauviŋmun ilaan taliqpiata tuŋaanun qiḷaŋmi. "
6299," far above every rule and authority and power and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come. ","Tavra Christ kamanałhaaqsiŋaruq isaġuliŋniñ ilitqusiqł̣uŋniḷḷu, suli suaŋŋatiniñ ataniġnaqutiniḷḷu. Aasii ilaan kamanautaa kamanałhaasugruktuq supayaaniñ mattumani nunami, naagga nunami qaiyumaaqtuami. "
6300," And God put all things under Christ’s feet, and he gave him to the church as head over all things. ","Aasiisuli God-im aŋalatchiyumiñaqsiŋagaa Christ supayaanik, iñupayaaniglu. Aasii Christ niaquummatun ittuq aŋaiyyuliqiruanun timigimmatun itamiñun. Ilaan atanniqsimagai iluqaisa aŋaiyyuliqiruat, suli nayuqłiataa ittuq iluqaiññi, tainnatuttauq nayuqłiataa inmatun sumiḷiqaa."
6301," Now the church is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.",
6302," And although you were dead in your transgressions and sins, ","Tavra ilivsi qaŋapak tuquŋaruatun iñuktun inŋagaluaqtuasii qanuq piḷuksiŋavlusi kamagiŋił̣ł̣ugiḷḷu God-im pitquraŋi, God-im aitchuŋagaasi iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. "
6303," in which you formerly lived according to this world’s present path, according to the ruler of the kingdom of the air, the ruler of the spirit that is now energizing the sons of disobedience, ","Taimani iñuuŋagaluaqtuasii piḷuusiqutini, nunam iñuŋisa iñuusiatitun. Taimani qaukłiata ilitqusiqł̣uich piḷuusiqipkaŋavlusi, paŋmapaksuli iñuŋnik kamaksripkaiŋiñmatun God-im pitquraŋiñik. "
6304," among whom all of us also formerly lived out our lives in the cravings of our flesh, indulging the desires of the flesh and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest… ","Tainnauvva iluqata qaŋauvlugu iñuusuuŋagaluaqtuaguut.

Tavra ukpiqtuaguŋiññapta taimani, tatavsaqtauyumiñaŋagaluaġmiugut allatuttauq iluqaisitun ukpiŋaitchuatitun iñuktitun."
6305," But God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us, ",Aglaan God naglikkutiqpaqaŋaruq uvaptiŋnun suli piviuttaġiqpaŋagaatigut. 
6306," even though we were dead in transgressions, made us alive together with Christ – by grace you are saved! – ","Irrusiqaŋagaluaqtilluta tuquŋaruatun iñuktun pisigivlugich piḷuutivut, God-im aitchuŋagaatigut iñuggunmik isuitchuamik aŋipkaqamiuŋ Christ tuqqunmiñ, qanuq atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagikput Christ. God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun annaurrauŋarugut. "
6307," and he raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, ","Aasiisuli atausiŋŋuqatigiŋavlugu Christ, aŋipkaqtauganiŋammatun ittugut Christ aŋipkaqtaumman. Suli inmiuq uvagut qiḷaŋmiitaniŋmatun aquppivḷuta inaani kamanaqsipkaqtauvium piqatigivlugu Christ Jesus, qanuq ilaa atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagikput. "
6308, to demonstrate in the coming ages the surpassing wealth of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. ,"Tainna pikami God piaqłuktautaipiaġataŋaruq uvaptiŋnun atausiŋŋuqatigipkaqamisigut Christ-mun, aasii taavruma iḷisimanaqsiñiaġaa isuitchuamun qanutun God naglikkutiqpaqaqtilaaŋa uvaptiŋnun. "
6309," For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God; ",Qanuq God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋagun annaurrauŋarusi ukpiliqavsi. Annautiŋaitchusi ilivsiññik sunik piḷusi. Taamna annaun God-im aitchuutaa ilivsiññun. 
6310," it is not from works, so that no one can boast. ","Annaurrauŋaitchusi pisigilugich piḷġusiḷḷuatasi. Annaurraullaniġuvsi piḷġusiḷḷuatasi pisigilugich, iñuk uqavigaaġutiksraqaġniaġaluaqtuq. "
6311," For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them. ","Aglaan God ilaa allaŋŋuqtitchiŋaruq uvaptiŋnik, atausiŋŋuqataullasivḷuta Christ-mun, iñuulluatallasitquvluta. God sivuniqaŋaniqsuq iŋiḷġaan tainna iñuuruksrauvluta."
6312," Therefore remember that formerly you, the Gentiles in the flesh – who are called “uncircumcision” by the so-called “circumcision” that is performed on the body by human hands – ",Tavra itqaqsiuŋ qaŋauvlugu ilivsi Jew-guŋitchuasii taiguqtauŋagaluaqtilaaqsi nalunaiñŋutaiḷanik Jew-guruanun timimiŋni nalunaiñŋutaqaqtuanun. 
6313," that you were at that time without the Messiah, alienated from the citizenship of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. ","Itqaumasitchi taimani atausiŋŋuqatigiŋaitkiksi Christ, iḷauŋaiñŋarusi God-im iñuksraqtaaŋiñun Israel-guruanun. Piqatauyumiñaiñŋarusi aitchuusiaqaqtuanun unniqsuqłiisinik God-im sivunniuġutigiŋakkaŋiñik iñuksraqtaamiñun, aasii piqaŋił̣ł̣usi annagummanmik, suli naluvlugu God. "
6314, But now in Christ Jesus you who used to be far away have been brought near by the blood of Christ. ,"Tavra uŋasiguuŋagaluaqtuasii God-miñ, paŋmapak Christ qaġġisiŋagaasi ilaanun, maqipkaqługu auni tuqqutivlusi. "
6315," For he is our peace, the one who made both groups into one and who destroyed the middle wall of partition, the hostility, ","Christ aŋuyautaiqsinŋagaatigut God-mun avanmullu. Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu atiŋitkaluaqtuat uumikkutivlutiŋ, paŋmapak atisiŋarut aŋuyautiŋaiqł̣utiŋ. "
6316," when he nullified in his flesh the law of commandments in decrees. He did this to create in himself one new man out of two, thus making peace, ","Jew-guruat pigivlugich iluqaisa God-im pitquraŋi, aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmiḷu piraġautchich, isummatigiŋarut inmiŋnik nalaunŋałhaaqłutiŋ Jew-guŋitchuaniñ.

Taamna pisigivlugu Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu atausiŋŋuqatigiŋagaat Christ, aasii aŋuyautiŋaiqł̣utiŋ avanmun. "
6317," and to reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by which the hostility has been killed. ","Atunim Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu avilaitqatigiiksittut God-mun Christ tuqqutaagun aŋarraurami, aasii paŋmapak suuramik-unnii uumikkutaiqsut avanmun. "
6318," And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near, ","Suli Christ tiliŋagai alġaqsruirini quliaqtuaġutitquvlusi aŋuyaŋaiġunmik God-mun, ilivsi Jew-guŋitchuasii uŋasiŋagaluaqtuasii God-miñ Jew-guruallu qanittuat God-mun. "
6319, so that through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father. ,"Tavra atausiŋŋuqatigiŋakaptigu Christ iluqata, Jew-guruallu Jew-guŋitchuallu, ikayuqtiqaqtugut atautchimik Ilitqusiġiksuamik ullautitquvluta Aapamun."
6320," So then you are no longer foreigners and noncitizens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of God’s household, ","Tavraasii tavraŋŋaaglaan allayuaguŋaiqsusi iglaaguŋaiqsusiḷu, aglaan atausiŋŋuqataurusi ilaaguaqtauruanun God-mun, iḷaliutivlusiḷu igluqatiŋiñun God-im. "
6321," because you have been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone. ","Ilivsi igluqpaum iḷagimmatun itkaasi nappakkaŋata maŋŋuliġmatun pivḷugu tilirauruaniglu uqaqtiŋiñiglu God-im, Christ Jesus ilaa sivulliqsun maŋŋuksratun uyaġaktun maŋŋuliutiqqaaqługu. "
6322," In him the whole building, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord, ",Qaaŋanun taavruma maŋŋuliutauqqaaqtuam uyaġaum igluqpak iluqani ipiqqiqsauruq aasii nappaqługu aŋaiyyuviguqsaiññaqtuatun ilaaguaqtauvlugu Ataniġmun. 
6323, in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in the Spirit.,Tavraptauq tainnatun ilivsi iḷagimmigaasi God-im igluata aasii God iñuuvluni iḷuvsiññi Ilitqusiġiksuamigun.
6324," For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus for the sake of you Gentiles – ",Uvaŋa Paul tigutaaqtauruŋa pisigivlugu alġaqsruiñiġa tusaayugaaġiksuamik Christ-kun ilivsiññun Jew-guŋitchuanun. 
6325," if indeed you have heard of the stewardship of God’s grace that was given to me for you, ","Iḷisimarusi God-mun aitchuŋatilaamnik taavrumiŋa savaaksrapiaġatamik, alġaqsruiñiġmik ilivsiññun Jew-guŋitchuanun God-im nagliktuutiqpaŋanik. "
6326," that by revelation the divine secret was made known to me, as I wrote before briefly. ","Taamna sivunniuġutaa God-im Jew-guŋitchuanun iḷisimanaiñŋaruaq sivuani, God-im salapqiŋagaa uvamnun. Taamna uqautigillaŋagiga uqautigipiasuŋaġnagu tuyuutimni. "
6327," When reading this, you will be able to understand my insight into this secret of Christ. ","Aasii taiguallaisa tuyuutitka, puttuqsriñiaġiksi kaŋiqsisiqaqtilaaġa alġaqsruutiqaġniġmik Christ-mik. "
6328," Now this secret was not disclosed to people in former generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit, ",God-im kaŋiqsipkaŋaitkaa taimani iñuuruanun iñuŋnun paŋmapak kaŋiqsipkaisiġmisun ilaaguaqtamiñun uqaqtimiñullu Ilitqusiġiksuakun. 
6329," namely, that through the gospel the Gentiles are fellow heirs, fellow members of the body, and fellow partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus. ","Aasiuvva God-im salapqiŋakkaŋa. Jew-guŋitchuat kiŋuvaannaqataullasivḷugich Jew-guruanun. Iliŋich Jew-guruatuttauq pigillavlugich Christ-gum, aasii piqataullasivḷutiŋ annaunmun unniqsuqłiisauŋaruamun Christ-kun, ukpiġiliqamisigik tusaayugaaġiksuat."
6330, I became a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God’s grace that was given to me by the exercise of his power. ,"God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagaaŋa alġaqsruirautquvluŋa tamattumiŋa tusaayugaaġiksuamik, nagliktuutiqpaqaqłuni uvamnun annautivluŋa suaŋŋanmigun. "
6331," To me – less than the least of all the saints – this grace was given, to proclaim to the Gentiles the unfathomable riches of Christ ","Kamanaiññiqsraugaluaqtilluŋa iluqaiññiñ ilaaguaqtauruaniñ God-mun, ilaa naglikkutiqaŋaruq uvamnun, aasii uvamnun alġaqsruutigitquŋagai Jew-guŋitchuanun inuaŋaitchuat anniqsuusiaksraŋich iluqaġmiŋ, atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruat Christ-mun. "
6332, and to enlighten everyone about God’s secret plan – a secret that has been hidden for ages in God who has created all things. ,"Suli God-im piraksriŋagaaŋa kaŋiqsiñaqsitquvlugu ilaan sivunniuġutigiŋarani iñupayaanun, annaurrauniksraŋat iñupayaurat Jew-guŋitkaluaqtuat Jew-guruallu. God-im savaŋaruam supayaanik, nalunaqtinŋagaa aippaapak taamna sivunniuġutini. "
6333, The purpose of this enlightenment is that through the church the multifaceted wisdom of God should now be disclosed to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly realms. ,"Paŋmapak God-im iḷitchuġipkaŋagaa sivunniuġutini aŋaiyyuliqiruatigun, tamatkua iluqaisa isaġulgiḷḷu ilitqusiqł̣uiḷḷu tautuquvlugich taŋŋiutaanik kamanaqtuam isumattutaata God-im. "
6334," This was according to the eternal purpose that he accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord, ",God-im sivunniuġutigiŋagaa taimaŋŋaqaŋa isuaniñ taamna sivunniuġutini taŋŋiqsauniaġnivḷugu Jesus Christ-kun Ataniptigun. 
6335, in whom we have boldness and confident access to God because of Christ’s faithfulness. ,"Aasii pisigivlugu ukpiġniqput ilaanun, qikkisaiġḷuta attaqsruutaiġḷutalu ullautiyumiñaqtugut God-mun. "
6336," For this reason I ask you not to lose heart because of what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.","Nagliksaaqtuŋa pisigivlugu quliaqtuaqaġniġa tusaayugaaġiksuanik ilivsiññun, aasii apiġigivsi ipiqtusuutigitquŋił̣ł̣ugu taamna, aglaan qapiŋaisaaġusiaġitquvlugu pisigilugu anniqsuusiaqaŋaniqsi alġaqsruutipkun ilivsiññun."
6337," For this reason I kneel before the Father, ","Isummatigikapkich tamatkua iluqaisa God-im sivunniuġutigiŋaraŋi, pułłuŋa aŋaiyyuruŋa Aapamun, "
6338, from whom every family in heaven and on the earth is named. ,"Aapauruamun iluqaiññun ukpiqtuanun, qiḷaŋmiitkaluaqpata naagga nunamiitpata, "
6339," I pray that according to the wealth of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner person, ","aŋaiyyuvluŋa God-mun inuaŋaitchuamik nagliktuutiqpaqaqtuamun, suaŋŋasipiaġataquvlusi Ilitqusiġiksuaŋanun iḷuvsiññiittuamun iñuuyumiñaqsiḷusi nalaunŋaruakun, "
6340," that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, so that, because you have been rooted and grounded in love, ","iḷisimanaġumauq Christ iñuutilaaŋa uummativsiññi sivisutilaaŋatun ukpiqsimaaġnivsi.

6341," you may be able to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, ","qanutun kamanaqtilaaŋa piviuttaqqutaata Christ-gum uvaptiŋnun.

6342," and thus to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.",Qanutułhaaq God-im pisiyumiñaġaatigut qaaŋiġḷuguunnii apiqsriaġiyumiñakkaqput naagga qiñiqtuuraaġumiñakkaqput. Taamna ilaan piḷḷagaa Ilitqusiġiksuakun ikayuqtigianikkaptigun ilaan iñuutqutaagun uvaptiŋnun. 
6343," Now to him who by the power that is working within us is able to do far beyond all that we ask or think, ","Iñupayaat isuiḷaamik nanġaġlirruŋ God paŋmapaŋmiñ isagutilugu isuitchuamullu, pisigilugu ilaan aktilaaganignaġumiñaitchuaq kamanautaa iḷisimanaqsiŋaruaq aŋaiyyuliqiruatigullu Christ-kullu."
6344," to him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations, forever and ever. Amen.",
6345," I, therefore, the prisoner for the Lord, urge you to live worthily of the calling with which you have been called, ","Tavraasii uvaŋa, tigutaaqtaq savautivlugu Ataniq, qiññuaġivsi iñuutquvlusi nalliummatiruamik God-im iñuutqutaanun ilivsiññun, "
6346," with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, ","kamasaaŋiḷḷusi pikałaktautaiḷḷusiḷu qiñuirrutilusiḷu avanmun, manimmisilusiḷu pimaqłuutivsigun avanmun pisigilugu piviuttaqqutiniqsi. "
6347, making every effort to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. ,"Ilitqusiġiksuam atipkaġlisi, tutqiutiqaġumausi avanmun. "
6348," There is one body and one Spirit, just as you too were called to the one hope of your calling, ","Qanuq iluqasi atausiurusi, timitun atausiuruatun. Atausiummiuq Ilitqusiġiksuaq, aasii God-im ququaŋammigaasi piqatigiiquvlusi atautchimi annagummanmi. "
6349," one Lord, one faith, one baptism, ","Suli atausiummiuq Ataniq, ukpiġivigikkaŋat iñuich atunim, iḷaŋiutiŋammiut atunim atautchimun paptaiġunmun. "
6350," one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.","Suli atausiummiuq God, aapaŋat iñuich iluqaġmiŋ, qaukłiġikkaŋat supayaat, savaktuaq supayaatigun, suli iñuuruaq supayaani."
6351, But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ. ,Tavra Christ aitchuŋagaatigut atausiullaavluta piraksrallaanik supayaanik pitqukkamiñik uvaptiŋnun. 
6352," Therefore it says, “When he ascended on high he captured captives; he gave gifts to men.” ","Taamna sivuniġivlugu, aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna,"
6353," Now what is the meaning of “he ascended,” except that he also descended to the lower regions, namely, the earth? ","Tavraasii Ataniq uqaqsiqł̣ugu uqallautigivsi qapiŋaiqł̣uŋa tavraŋŋaaglaan iñuusiqaŋaipiaquvlusi Jew-guŋitchuatun, isumaqaqtuatun anniqsuutauŋitchuanik, "
6354," He, the very one who descended, is also the one who ascended above all the heavens, in order to fill all things. ","suli kaŋiqsiḷaił̣ł̣utiŋ, qanuq nalupiallaktut uqayunaitchullu. Iliŋich iḷaŋiutiyumiñaitchut iñuutchimun God-im aitchuutaanun. "
6355," It was he who gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as pastors and teachers, ","Suqpagillaiŋagaich unnii iluqaisa kanŋunaqtuat sut, aitchuutigivlutiŋ inmiŋnik qanusipayaamun pigiiḷḷiqunmun, maliġuaqługich isummiutitiŋ qanusipayauramun pigiitchuamun pitchaiḷiraġniaġnatiŋ."
6356," to equip the saints for the work of ministry, that is, to build up the body of Christ, ",Iḷisaŋaitchusi tainnatchimik iñuutchimik iḷisausiavsigun Christ-kun. 
6357," until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God – a mature person, attaining to the measure of Christ’s full stature. ","Nalupqinaitchuq tusaayugaaġiŋagiksi Christ, aasii ilaan maliġuaqtigimmasi iḷisausiaqaŋarusi iḷumun ittuanik Jesus iḷisaurrutiŋiñik. "
6358," So we are no longer to be children, tossed back and forth by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching by the trickery of people who craftily carry out their deceitful schemes. ","Tavraasii aŋalatinŋaiġitchi piḷuksisuguuruanun iñuusiġruavsiññun, pipkaisuuruanun ilivsiññik taimani iñuusiġisuukkavsiññik pigiipiaġataqtuakun inŋaruanik, kipiqsaaqłusi pigiitchuanun sagluqivlusiḷu. "
6359," But practicing the truth in love, we will in all things grow up into Christ, who is the head. ",Nutaaġuqtuksraupiaqtusi kipiġniuġutigikkavsigun isumanivsiññiḷu. 
6360," From him the whole body grows, fitted and held together through every supporting ligament. As each one does its part, the body grows in love.","Aŋalatittuksraupiaqtusi nutauruamun iñuutchivsiññun savaaguruamun God-im irrusiatun, iñuupkaiyumiñaqtuamun ilivsiññik iḷumutun nalaunŋaruakun piḷuutaitchuakullu."
6361," So I say this, and insist in the Lord, that you no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking. ","Tavraasii sagluuŋaiġitchi. Iñupayaaq uqaqtuksraupiaqtuq iḷumun ittuamik ukpiqtuaguqanmiñun, qanuq iluqata atautchimiittugut timaani Christ. "
6362," They are darkened in their understanding, being alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardness of their hearts. ","Qinnaliġuvsi piḷuksisiginagu. Qinnaŋanasi uvluqtutilaaŋatun, "
6363," Because they are callous, they have given themselves over to indecency for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. ",tuunġaq piviksraqaqtitauŋitchumauq piḷuksipkaġumiñaġlusi. 
6364," But you did not learn about Christ like this, ","Tavraŋŋaaglaan tigligaqti tigligaŋaiġḷi, aglaan savagli saglutaġautaitchuakun, aitchuutiksranikkumauq piiḷḷiuqtuanun. "
6365," if indeed you heard about him and were taught in him, just as the truth is in Jesus. ","Uqaluqaġnasi anniaġutauruanik iñuŋnun, aglaan uqaluqaġitchi anniqsuutauyumiñaqtuanik sivunmuktuutauyumiñaqtuaniglu, tamatkua tusaaruat uqaluvsiññik anniqsuusiaqaġumaut. "
6366," You were taught with reference to your former way of life to lay aside the old man who is being corrupted in accordance with deceitful desires, ","Suli isumaalluksaaġnagu Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa God-im, qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuaq God-im nalunaiñŋutchiutigiŋagaa pigiliutivlusi, nalupqinaiyautigivlugu uvlumi taivrumani God-im annaktinniaġmasi iluqaaniñ piḷuunmiñ.

6369," Therefore, having laid aside falsehood, each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. ",
6370, Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on the cause of your anger. ,
6371, Do not give the devil an opportunity. ,
6372," The one who steals must steal no longer; rather he must labor, doing good with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with the one who has need. ",
6373," You must let no unwholesome word come out of your mouth, but only what is beneficial for the building up of the one in need, that it may give grace to those who hear. ",
6374," And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. ",
6375," You must put away every kind of bitterness, anger, wrath, quarreling, and evil, slanderous talk. ",
6376," Instead, be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ also forgave you.",
6377," Therefore, be imitators of God as dearly loved children ","God-im tainna piqpagivlusi miqłiqtuliutimmasi ilivsiḷi tainnatun piñiḷuktuksraurusi avanmun, qanuq ilaan piviuttaġivlusi miqłiqtuġigaasi. "
6378," and live in love, just as Christ also loved us and gave himself for us, a sacrificial and fragrant offering to God. ","Piviuttaqqutiqpaqaġitchi allanun iñuŋnun, maliġuaġlugu tuvraaksriutaa Christ piviuttaġivluta aitchuutigiŋaruq inmiñik God-mun tuqutauvluni piḷuutaiġukłuta.

6379," But among you there must not be either sexual immorality, impurity of any kind, or greed, as these are not fitting for the saints. ","God-im iñugimmasi allatuqtuksrauŋitchusi, qanusipayaamiglu pigiitchuamik, kaviuqtuksrauŋitchusiḷu suuramik-unnii. "
6380," Neither should there be vulgar speech, foolish talk, or coarse jesting – all of which are out of character – but rather thanksgiving. ","Uqautiqaqtuksrauŋitchusiḷu kanŋunaqtuanik.

6381," For you can be confident of this one thing: that no person who is immoral, impure, or greedy (such a person is an idolater) has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God. ","Una nalupqinaigisiuŋ, kiñaliqaa allatuqtauruaq isiġumiñaitchuq atanniqsimavianun Christ God-ivlu naagga pigiiḷḷiqirauruaq naaggaunnii kaviuqtauruaq, kaviuġiłhaaqługich iñuiḷḷu sullu God-miñ.

6383," Therefore do not be partakers with them, ",Sagluqinniŋniaqtuanun piqasiqsuutinasi. 
6384," for you were at one time darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of the light – ","Ilivsivsauq piḷuusiqiugaġuuŋagaluaqtuasii iñuummatun taaġmi, paŋmapak Atanġum iñugiliutimmasi, piḷuusiqiugaŋaiqsusi, qaummaġmi iñuuruatun. Tavraasii iñuutuiññaqtuksraurusi qaummaġmi. "
6385," for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth – ","Iñuukavsi qaummaġmi, iñuupkaqtitaurusi nakuupiaqtuakun nalaunŋapiaqtuakullu iḷumupiaġlu ittuakun. "
6386, trying to learn what is pleasing to the Lord. ,Iḷitchisaiññaġitchi iñuuniaġniġmik iviġaumasuglugu Ataniq.

6388, For the things they do in secret are shameful even to mention. ,Qanuq kanŋunaqtut-unnii uqautigisaqtuni piḷġusiŋich nalunautchivḷutiŋ. 
6389, But all things being exposed by the light are made evident. ,"Satqummiġuvsigik qaummaum qaummaġigviginiaġai piḷuutiŋich aasii satqummiġḷugich aasii iḷitchuġigumiŋ qanutun killukuapiaġataqtilaamiŋnik, iḷaŋich iḷaanni iñuurraqsiñiaqtut qaummaġmi. "
6390," For everything made evident is light, and for this reason it says: ","Taamna pisigivlugu God uqallaŋaruq Bible-ni inna, “Itiġiñ siñiktii, qimakkich tuqqutauyumiñaqtuat piḷuutitin, aasiiḷi Christ iñuullasipkaġniaġaatin qaummaġmi.”"
6391,"“Awake, O sleeper! ","Qaunakłaapiaġitchiasiiñ qanuq iñuutilaavsiññik, isumalluaġiitchuatun iñuktun piŋaiġḷusi aglaan isumaturuatun, "

6394," Therefore be very careful how you live – not as unwise but as wise, ","Suli imiŋasisiqaġnasi taaŋŋaġmik, qanuq taamna piaġiitchuamun pialapiaġataġniġmun ittuq, aglaan Ilitqusiġiksuamun aŋalatittitchi, "

6396," For this reason do not be foolish, but be wise by understanding what the Lord’s will is. ","ataramik quyyatigilugich supayaat God-mun Aapamun, atqagun Atanipta Jesus Christ."
6397," And do not get drunk with wine, which is debauchery, but be filled by the Spirit, ","Qiksiksrautiqaqavsi Christ-mun, kamakkutiugaġitchi avanmun. "
6398," speaking to one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, singing and making music in your hearts to the Lord, ","Nuliaguruasii, kamagisigik uisi, kamagimmatuttauq Ataniq. "
6399," always giving thanks to God the Father for each other in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, ","Qanuq uiguruaq ataniġnaqutiqaqtuq nuliamiñun Christ-tuttauq ataniġnaqutiqaqtuatun aŋaiyyuliqiruanun, suli Christ ilaa annaurrigigaat aŋaiyyuliqiruat, ilaan timigimmatun itaŋisa. "
6400, and submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ. ,"Aŋaiyyuliqiruatun kamakkutiqaqtuatun Christ-mun, tainnatuttauq nuliaguruat kamakkutiqaġlich uimiŋnun supayaatigun."
6401," Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord, ","Uiguruasii, piviuttaġisigik nuliasi, tainnatuttauq Christ piviuttaġimmatun aŋaiyyuliqiruat suli aitchuutigivluni inmiñik pisigivlugich tuqutauvluni. "
6402, because the husband is the head of the wife as also Christ is the head of the church – he himself being the savior of the body. ,"Ilaa tainna piŋaruq aŋaiyyuliqiruat ilaaguaqsaqługich God-mun, akuqtuġnaġumiñaqsisaqługich piraksriŋagai paptaiqsautquvlugich kamagilugiḷḷu uqaluŋni. "
6403," But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit to their husbands in everything. ",Ilaa tuquŋammiuq iñuich aŋaiyyuliqiruaġuġlugich ilaan pigiliutisukługich. Niviaqsiaq aŋunmun tuvaaqasiutiruatun ilaan aŋaiyyuliqiruani piḷuutaitqugai naġġunaqtuagiḷḷugich piññaġnaqtuatun niviaqsiatun tuvaaqatiksrautiqaqtuatun salumavluni qanusiḷimaamiñ suaġiirrunmiñ. 
6404," Husbands, love your wives just as Christ loved the church and gave himself for her ",Uiguruat piviuttaġiraksraġigaich nuliatiŋ nanmiñiq timimiktun iḷiḷugich. Iñuk piviuttaqsriruaq nuliamiñik piviuttaġiruq inmiñun. 
6405," to sanctify her by cleansing her with the washing of the water by the word, ","Qanuq qaŋaunnii iñuum uumigiŋaitkaa timini, aglaan pamatchuugaa qaunagivlugulu, Christ-tauq qaunaksrimmatun aŋaiyyuliqiruanik, "
6406," so that he may present the church to himself as glorious – not having a stain or wrinkle, or any such blemish, but holy and blameless. ",qanuq ilaan uvagut timigimmatun itkaatigut atausiŋŋuqatigivluta. 
6407, In the same way husbands ought to love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself. ,"Bible uqaluŋiññi God uqallaŋaruq inna, “Taamna pisigilugu, aŋutim qimaguuniġik aapaniḷu aakaniḷu aasii nayuqsiutivlugu nuliani. Tavra iliŋik malġuuruak atautchisun iñuktun iḷiñiaqtuk.” "
6408," For no one has ever hated his own body but he feeds it and takes care of it, just as Christ also does the church, ","Kamanaqtuaq iḷisaurrun salapqiŋaruq taavrumuuna Bible uqaluatigun tuvaaqatigiikkun, aasiivsauq kaŋiqsigiga sivuniqaqtilaaŋanik Christ-mullu aŋaiyyuliqiruanullu. "
6409, for we are members of his body. ,"Suli sivuniqaġmiuq ilivsiññun tuvaaqatigiiksuanun. Aŋutipayaam piviuttaġiraksraġigaa nuliani ilimisun iḷiḷugu, suli nuliaguruam isummatigilluataġlugu uiñi."
6410," For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. ",
6411, This mystery is great – but I am actually speaking with reference to Christ and the church. ,
6412," Nevertheless, each one of you must also love his own wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband. ",
6413," From Paul and Timothy, slaves of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with the overseers and deacons. ","Ukua tuyuutit qairut ilivsiññun Paul-miñ Timothy-miḷḷu, kivgauruaŋniñ Jesus Christ-mun.

6414, Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ!,God-tiptuq Aapapta Atanġuvlu Jesus Christ tutqiutiqaqtillisi nagliktuusiaqpaqaqtillusiḷu.
6415, I thank my God every time I remember you. ,"Quyyavigisuugiga God-tiga itqalimaaqavsi, "
6416, I always pray with joy in my every prayer for all of you ,"ataramik aŋaiyyutipayaamni aŋaiyyutisuugivsi quviasuutiqaqłuŋa, "
6417, because of your participation in the gospel from the first day until now. ,quyyatigivlugu ikayuqavsiŋa savaamni alġaqsruivḷuŋa tusaayugaaġiksuamik uvlumiñqaŋa ukpiliqqaaġataġnivsiññiñ paŋmapaŋmun aglaan.

6419," For it is right for me to think this about all of you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel all of you became partners in God’s grace together with me. ","Piviuttaġiqpakkivsi.

6420, For God is my witness that I long for all of you with the affection of Christ Jesus. ,"God iḷisimaruq iḷumun uqaqtilaamnik uqallakama kipiġniuttaġipiaġnivḷugu nayuqsiutisukłusi, Christ Jesus tainna irrusiqaqtitkaaŋa iḷumni."

6422," so that you can decide what is best, and thus be sincere and blameless for the day of Christ, ","sivuniksraqtaaġiyumiñaqsiḷugu iłuaġniqsrauruaq. Tainna piguvsi, piḷuutiqaġniaŋitchusi pasirauniaŋitchusiḷu Christ qaikpan. "

6424," I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that my situation has actually turned out to advance the gospel: ","Aniqatiitkaa, iḷisimatqugivsi tigutaaqtaunimni piruat uvamnun siamitivsaaqsiññaŋagaat tusaayugaaġiksuaq. "
6425," The whole imperial guard and everyone else knows that I am in prison for the sake of Christ, ",Uvuŋaqamaqaŋa iluqaġmiŋ munaqsrich umialgum igluqpaŋani iluqaġmiglu allat uvaniittuat iḷitchuġiŋarut tigutaaqtautilaamnik pisigivlugu Christ-mun kivgauniġa. 
6426," and most of the brothers and sisters, having confidence in the Lord because of my imprisonment, now more than ever dare to speak the word fearlessly.","Suli tigutaaqtauniġma qapiŋaiqsaaŋagai aniqatit nalupqisuŋaimmaġiksaaqługich ukpiġunmiŋni Ataniġmun, aasii iqsisaiqsiññaqłutiŋ alġaqsruutigivlugu God-im uqalua sivuuġaŋaiqł̣utiŋ."
6427," Some, to be sure, are preaching Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from goodwill. ","Iñuich iḷaŋisa alġaqsruutigiŋagaat Christ killuqsraqłutiŋ qanaaġuksiññaqłutiŋ, aglaattauq allat alġaqsruutigiŋagaat pisuutigikł̣utiŋ. "
6428, The latter do so from love because they know that I am placed here for the defense of the gospel. ,"Tamatkuali aqulliich alġaqsruirut piviuttaġivluŋa iḷisimavlutiŋ God-mun savaaksriñŋatilaamnik, taluqsraŋaiġḷuŋa uqautigitquvlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq nalaunŋaruakun. "
6429," The former proclaim Christ from selfish ambition, not sincerely, because they think they can cause trouble for me in my imprisonment. ","Allalli iñuich alġaqsruutigiŋitkaat Christ pipiaġataġlutiŋ, aglaan uvaŋa killuġivluŋa. Tainna alġaqsruirut isumavlutiŋ iłuiḷḷiuqtivsaaġukkaluaqłuŋa tigutaaqtaunnamni. "
6430," What is the result? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is being proclaimed, and in this I rejoice.","Suŋitchuq.

6432, for I know that this will turn out for my deliverance through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. ,"Kipiġniupiaġataqtuŋa piyummatigipiaġigalu suuramikunnii inuqtitchisuŋił̣ł̣uŋa piraksriusiamnik Christ-miñ, aglaan ataramik paŋmapak-unnii qapiŋairrutiqapiaġuktuŋa supayaatigun pikkapkun Christ nanġausiaqaquvlugu, iñuugaluaġuma naagga tuqugaluaġuma. "
6433," My confident hope is that I will in no way be ashamed but that with complete boldness, even now as always, Christ will be exalted in my body, whether I live or die. ",Qanuq iñuunimni iñuusiġisutualukkiga savautilugu Christ. Aasii tuqugaluaġuma uvamnun anniqsuutaułhaaġniaqtuq. 
6434," For to me, living is Christ and dying is gain. ",Aglaan iñuuguma anniqsuutauvsaaġumiñaġmiuŋa savaapkun. Nalliaŋnik tigusisausiitchuŋa. 
6435," Now if I am to go on living in the body, this will mean productive work for me, yet I don’t know which I prefer: ","Qanuqsausiitchuŋa, iñuuluŋa naagga ullaglugu Ataniq. Qimagupiaġaluaġiga maani iñuuniq aasii nayuqsiutilugu Christ, qanuq taamna nakuułhaasaktaqtuq. "
6436," I feel torn between the two, because I have a desire to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far, ",Aglaan ilivsi pisigilusi iñuuruksraułhamaaqtuŋa. 
6437, but it is more vital for your sake that I remain in the body. ,"Iñuuniaqtilaaġasuli nalupqigiŋitkiga, Iḷisimaruŋa tuqutauniaŋisilaamnik uvani tigutaaġviŋmi. Iñuuniaqtuŋasuli ikayuġuglusi suaŋasiḷaaġuglugu quvianaqsiḷaaġuglugulu ukpiġurri. "
6438," And since I am sure of this, I know that I will remain and continue with all of you for the sake of your progress and joy in the faith, ",Aasii pisigilugu tigutaaqtauŋaiġñiġa utaqqiguvsi atqunaġlugu nanġaġniaġiksi Christ Jesus.
6439," so that what you can be proud of may increase because of me in Christ Jesus, when I come back to you.","Uvva una naumałhaaqtuq.

"
6440," Only conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ so that – whether I come and see you or whether I remain absent – I should hear that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind, by contending side by side for the faith of the gospel, ","Iqsitchaktinnasi akiḷḷiḷiqsuqtivsiññun.

6441," and by not being intimidated in any way by your opponents. This is a sign of their destruction, but of your salvation – a sign which is from God. ",Qanuq Christ ukpiġumiñaqsigiññaŋaitkaasi inmiñun aglaallu nagliksautigipkaġumiñaqsivḷuni ilivsiññun.

6443, since you are encountering the same conflict that you saw me face and now hear that I am facing.,

6461,"that is above every name,","Tainnatulli ilivsi quyaruksraummiusi, suli quviasuutivsiññi piqatigiluŋa."
6462, so that at the name of Jesus,"Atanġum Jesus pisuutigikpagu, piyummatigigiga tilisukługu Timothy ilivsiññun qilamipayaaq, quviasaaqtausukłuŋa tusaalluataġuma ilivsigun. "
6463,every knee will bow,"Piitchuŋa allamik iñuŋmik Timothy-tun ittuamik, kipiġniupiaġataġluni uŋiarrisaqaġniaqtuamik anniqsuġumavlusi. "

6467,to the glory of God the Father.,aasii ukpiġigiga Ataniq uvaŋaptauq qaiñiaqtilaamnik qilamipayaaq.
6468," So then, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only in my presence but even more in my absence, continue working out your salvation with awe and reverence, ","Isummatigiŋagiga tiliraksraġipiaqługu ilivsiññun Epaphroditus aniqatikput savaqatiga aŋuyaqatigalu, ilivsivsauq kivgaqsi savaktitaqsi ikayuqtigipkaqługu uvamnun, "
6469, for the one bringing forth in you both the desire and the effort – for the sake of his good pleasure – is God. ,"ilaan kipiqqutigimmigaasi tautugukłusi iluqasi, suli isumaaluŋammiuq tusaaŋaniqavsi naŋitilaamiñik. "
6470," Do everything without grumbling or arguing, ","Naŋipiaġataŋaruq tuquqqayaqtaallaġmi. Aglaan God-im nagligiŋagaa, kisianami nagligiŋitkaa aglaan uvaŋalu, iḷaanni isumaaġutiqavsaaġasugaluŋa. "
6471," so that you may be blameless and pure, children of God without blemish though you live in a crooked and perverse society, in which you shine as lights in the world ","Kipiġniuttaġiłhaaġiga tilisukługu quviatchaquvlusi taututqikkuvsiuŋ, aasiiḷi uvaŋa isumaaluutaiġḷuŋa. "
6472, by holding on to the word of life so that on the day of Christ I will have a reason to boast that I did not run in vain nor labor in vain. ,"Paġlayumagiksi quviasuutiqpakun paġlammatuttauq allat ukpiqtuaguqatisi. Suli isummatigilluataġaġusigik iñuich ilaatun ittuat, "
6473," But even if I am being poured out like a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice together with all of you. ","qanuq ilaan tuqqutigiqqayaŋagaa savaani Ataniġmun, anayasaaqługu iñuggunni naatinniaqługu savaaqsi uvamnun."
6474, And in the same way you also should be glad and rejoice together with me.,
6475," Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be encouraged by hearing news about you. ",
6476, For there is no one here like him who will readily demonstrate his deep concern for you. ,
6477," Others are busy with their own concerns, not those of Jesus Christ. ",
6478," But you know his qualifications, that like a son working with his father, he served with me in advancing the gospel. ",
6479," So I hope to send him as soon as I know more about my situation, ",
6480, though I am confident in the Lord that I too will be coming to see you soon.,
6481," But for now I have considered it necessary to send Epaphroditus to you. For he is my brother, coworker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to me in my need. ",
6482," Indeed, he greatly missed all of you and was distressed because you heard that he had been ill. ",
6483," In fact he became so ill that he nearly died. But God showed mercy to him – and not to him only, but also to me – so that I would not have grief on top of grief. ",
6484," Therefore I am all the more eager to send him, so that when you see him again you can rejoice and I can be free from anxiety. ",
6485," So welcome him in the Lord with great joy, and honor people like him, ",
6486, since it was because of the work of Christ that he almost died. He risked his life so that he could make up for your inability to serve me.,
6487," Finally, my brothers and sisters, rejoice in the Lord! To write this again is no trouble to me, and it is a safeguard for you.","Tavraasii aniqatiitkaa, quviasuutigisiuŋ Ataniq, Tuyutqigaġniq ilivsiññun pitqigaqługich sivuani tuyuutigiŋaratka ilivsiññun piḷaiġñaitchut uvamnun, anayanaiyautaugiññaqtut ilivsiññun.

6488," Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of those who mutilate the flesh! ","Quviqtaiḷisitchi iñuŋniñ pigiiḷḷiqiruaniñ, taigitka qimmiñik, iñuich uqaqtuat nalunaigutchigaksraunivḷusi timivsiññi annaurrauniaġuvsi. "
6489," For we are the circumcision, the ones who worship by the Spirit of God, exult in Christ Jesus, and do not rely on human credentials ","Uvagut iḷumun God-im miqłiqtuġigaatigut pisigisuŋaġnagu timivut nalunaiñŋutchiŋaniḷugich, aglaan savautivlugu God ilaan Ilitqusiġiksuaŋan ikayuqłuta, suli nanġaqługu Jesus Christ iñuggutiqaqtitchiruaq isuitchuamik.

6490," – though mine too are significant. If someone thinks he has good reasons to put confidence in human credentials, I have more: ","Tavra kiñaliqaa annaurrauyumiñaġniqpan pisigilugu Jew-gunini, qaałhiñakullu piraġautchich kamagilugich, nalupqisuŋił̣haaġayaqtuŋa annaurrauniaqtilaamnik allaniñ iñuŋniñ. "
6491," I was circumcised on the eighth day, from the people of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. I lived according to the law as a Pharisee. ","Nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaruŋa anikama tallimat piŋasuni uvlianikama. Israelite-guruŋa aniñipkun, maŋŋuġivlugu Benjamin, auga allamik avuiḷaaq Hebrew-piaġataq. Kamagiŋagitka Jew-guruat pitquraŋich qaunakłaapiaqłuŋa Pharisee-guvluŋa. "
6492, In my zeal for God I persecuted the church. According to the righteousness stipulated in the law I was blameless. ,"Suli kipiġniuqpaił̣ł̣uŋa iñupayaanun kamagitquvlugich pitqurat nagliksaaqtinŋagitka aŋaiyyuliqiruat. Iñuk qanutun nalaunŋasiyumiñaqtigiŋakpan kamagilugich pitqurat piraksriutiŋich, pasiñaġumiñaiñŋaruŋa. "
6493, But these assets I have come to regard as liabilities because of Christ. ,"Aglaan tamatkua isummatigisuuŋaratka anniqsuutaunasugalugich annaurrauniksrapkun paŋmapak isummatigiliġitka piñaiḷutauvlugich annaurrauniksramun, qanuq Christ kisimisualuk annautigaaŋa. "
6494," More than that, I now regard all things as liabilities compared to the far greater value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things – indeed, I regard them as dung! – that I may gain Christ, ","Isummatigiłhiñaŋiñmigitka tainna tamatkua kisiisa, aglaallu supayaat suksraallapiaġitka anniqsuutauŋaiqł̣ugich urriqatausaqpata anniqsuutaułhamaaqtuamun iḷitchuġivlugu Jesus Christ uvaŋa Ataniġa.

6495," and be found in him, not because I have my own righteousness derived from the law, but because I have the righteousness that comes by way of Christ’s faithfulness – a righteousness from God that is in fact based on Christ’s faithfulness. ",suli atausiŋŋuqatigisupiallakługu. Tavraŋŋaaglaan isumaqaŋaiqsuŋa uvamnik nalaunŋasiyumiñaġluŋa sivuġaani God-im kamagiugaqsiññaġlugich pitquraŋi.

6497," and so, somehow, to attain to the resurrection from the dead.",qakugukpan aŋipkaqtitauyumiñaġumauŋa tuqqunmiñ iñuggunmun.
6498," Not that I have already attained this – that is, I have not already been perfected – but I strive to lay hold of that for which Christ Jesus also laid hold of me. ","Uqallautiga sivuniqaŋitkiga naamasipiaġataŋaniḷuŋa ataramik iñuullasiḷuŋa Christ-tupiaġataq, aglaan siġġaqiruŋasuli Christ Jesus-tun iḷisaiññaġukłuŋa qanuq taamna pisigivlugu ilaan annautiŋagaaŋa. "
6499," Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself to have attained this. Instead I am single-minded: Forgetting the things that are behind and reaching out for the things that are ahead, ","Aniqatiit, iḷisimaruŋa tainnaiḷiŋaisilaamnik-suli.

6500," with this goal in mind, I strive toward the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. ","Aqpaliurraqtitun siġġaqiruŋa sivunmun tikitqaurraqługu killi, akiññaktaaġisukługu iñuuniksraq paŋmani. Taamna pisigivlugu God-im ququaŋagaaŋa Christ Jesus-kun. "
6501," Therefore let those of us who are “perfect” embrace this point of view. If you think otherwise, God will reveal to you the error of your ways. ","Tainnauvva iluqata isumaqaqtuksraugaluaqtugut, iluqata agliraksraiŋaruaguut ukpiqtuaguniptiŋni.

6502," Nevertheless, let us live up to the standard that we have already attained.","Qanupayaaq taamna isummatigigaluaġuvsiuŋ, pisuqtilaavsisun iñuulluataġniḷugitchi paŋmapak kaŋiqsisilaavsisun qanuq God-mun nalaunŋaruakun iñuutqutilaavsiññik."
6503," Be imitators of me, brothers and sisters, and watch carefully those who are living this way, just as you have us as an example. ","Aniqatiit, iluqasi tuvraqsiŋa nalaunŋaruakun iñuuniaġusimñi. Iñuusiġa naipiqtuutauli iñuŋnun iḷisimanaġumiñaqsiḷugich kisuutilaaŋat iḷumutun ukpiqtuaguruat, "
6504," For many live, about whom I have often told you, and now, with tears, I tell you that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ. ","qanuq iñugiaktuat iñuich iñuusiqaqtut akiḷḷiḷiqsuġmatun pivḷugu Christ tuqqutaa aŋarraurami. Uqautiŋagivsi tainnaittuanik iñuŋnik sivuani, aasii paŋmapak uqallautivsaaġivsi qulvisigivlugich. "
6505," Their end is destruction, their god is the belly, they exult in their shame, and they think about earthly things. ","Kaŋŋiññiaqtut nagliksaaġviŋmun god-tiqaqtut timimiŋ pisuguukkaŋiññik, kamasaaġutigigaich kanŋugiraksraġaluatiŋ, isumagiqpaksiññaqługich nunamiŋŋaqtauruat sut. "
6506," But our citizenship is in heaven – and we also await a savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, ",Aglaan uvagut aimaaġviksrautigigikput qiḷak. Tatpaŋmaŋŋa niġiugipiaġikput utiġumaaqtuaq Ataniq Jesus Christ annaurrikput. 
6507, who will transform these humble bodies of ours into the likeness of his glorious body by means of that power by which he is able to subject all things to himself.,"Ilaan allaŋŋuġniaġai tuqusuuruat timivut iḷipkaqsaġlugich ilaan aŋipkaqtauŋaruatun timimisun, suaŋŋatikun atanniqsimapkaiḷḷasiruakun ilaanik supayaanun."

6510," We always give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you, ","Aŋaiyyutikavsi quyyavigisuugikput God ataramik, Aapaŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ. "
6511, since we heard about your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints. ,Qanuq tusaaŋagikput ukpiġnaqsiŋaniqsi Christ Jesus-mun piviuttaqsriñiqsiḷu iluqaiññik ilaaguaqtauruanik God-mun. 
6512," Your faith and love have arisen from the hope laid up for you in heaven, which you have heard about in the message of truth, the gospel ","Aasii tainna iñuusiqaqtusi, iñuuqatigiyumavlugu God qiḷaŋmi isuitchuamun. Taamna piyumman pigiliutiqqaaŋagiksi iḷumun ittuaq tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutaumman ilivsiññun. "
6513," that has come to you. Just as in the entire world this gospel is bearing fruit and growing, so it has also been bearing fruit and growing among you from the first day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth. ","Taamna tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutauŋaruaq ilivsiññun alġaqsruutaummiuq iñuŋnun nunami iluqaani, aasii iñuvsaat ukpiliqł̣utiŋ Christ-mun, iñuugaqsivḷutiŋaasii Christ iñuutqutaagun, ilivsivsauq iñuusivsisun taimaŋŋaqaŋa tusaakavsiuŋ nagliktuutiqpaŋa God-im, kaŋiqsivḷugu iḷumun ittuaŋa.

6516," For this reason we also, from the day we heard about you, have not ceased praying for you and asking God to fill you with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, ","Taimaŋŋaqaŋa uvlumiñ tusaaviptiŋniñ taavrumiŋa, aŋaiyyutigivsi-suli, apiġivlugu God ataramik ikayuquvlusi iḷitchuġipiaquvlugu qanuq God-mun pitqutilaaqsi, Ilitqusiġiksuamun isumatusipkaquvlusi kaŋiqsipkaquvlusiḷu sumik God-im pitquyumakkaŋanik ilivsiññun.

6517," so that you may live worthily of the Lord and please him in all respects – bearing fruit in every good deed, growing in the knowledge of God, ","Suli aŋaiyyutivlusi iñuusiqaquyumavlusi nalliummatiruamik Ataniġmun, iviġaumalugu Ataniq supayaanik piguvsi, ataramik nakuurualiqilusi suli iḷitchuġisaiññaġlugu God.

6523," for all things in heaven and on earth were created by him – all things, whether visible or invisible, whether thrones or dominions, whether principalities or powers – all things were created through him and for him.","Ilaa God-itun ittuq qanuq ilaagun supayaat savaaguŋarut, sut qiḷaŋmiittuat sullu nunamiittuat, sut tautugnaqtuat sullu tautugnaitchuat, tamatkua ilitqutchich atanniqsimanniktuat, ilitqusiḷḷu suaŋŋatiqaqtuat sapiġñaqtuallu.

6524, He himself is before all things and all things are held together in him.,"Christ inŋaruq sivuanni supayaat, aasii ilaan suaŋŋataata igliqtitkai atautchikun piqatigiikł̣ugich supayaat savaani. "
6525," He is the head of the body, the church, as well as the beginning, the firstborn from among the dead, so that he himself may become first in all things.","Suli iñuk niaquata aŋalanmatun timaa, tainnatun Christ aŋalatkai ilaan iñuŋni aŋaiyyuliqiruat.

6527," and through him to reconcile all things to himself by making peace through the blood of his cross – through him, whether things on earth or things in heaven.","Suli Christ maqipkaġmagu auni, tuquvluni aŋarraurami, God-im iḷauraaliuŋagai aŋuyautaiqł̣ugich supayaat savaani, nunamiittuat qiḷaŋmiittuallu."
6528," And you were at one time strangers and enemies in your minds as expressed through your evil deeds, ","Suli qaŋauvlugu ilivsi uŋasiŋarusi God-miñ. Uumigiŋagiksi, iñuuvlusi piḷuutini. "
6529," but now he has reconciled you by his physical body through death to present you holy, without blemish, and blameless before him – ","Paŋmapak-aasii Christ iḷauraaliuŋagaasi God-lu, aitchuutigivlugu timini tuqutautquvlugu aŋarraurami, ilivsi akuqtuġnaqsitquvlusi God-mun, piḷuutaiqsauŋalusi, pasiñaġumiñaiŋalusiḷu ilaan sivuġaani. "
6530," if indeed you remain in the faith, established and firm, without shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard. This gospel has also been preached in all creation under heaven, and I, Paul, have become its servant. ","Aglaan ukpiŋaiqsuksrauŋitchusi, ukpiġutiqaġitchi suaŋapiaqtuamik, tuniqsimaruamik, suli niġiugiŋaiġñagu annaurrauniksraqsi taŋŋiqsauniaqtilaaŋanik tusaaŋakkavsisun tusaayugaaġiksuakun.

6531," Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you, and I fill up in my physical body – for the sake of his body, the church – what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ. ","Paŋmapak quviasuktuŋa pisigivlugu nagliksaaqtitauniġa ilivsi pisigivlusi. Nagliksaaqtitaukama Christ nagliksaaġmatun piuq.

6532," I became a servant of the church according to the stewardship from God – given to me for you – in order to complete the word of God, ","God-im kivgaksraqtaaġiŋagaaŋa aŋaiyyuliqiruanun ilivsi iḷagivlusi, piraksriqł̣uŋa uqautigimmaġiksaaquvlugu ilaan uqaluksrirrutini, "

6534," God wanted to make known to them the glorious riches of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. ","Iliŋiññun, iḷagivlugich Jew-guŋitchuat, God-im satqummiġuliŋagaa qanutun kamanaqtigivluni kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruaq.

6537," For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you, and for those in Laodicea, and for those who have not met me face to face. ","Iḷisimatqugivsi qanutupayauraq piŋigitilaavsiññik, taamapkualu Laodicea-miittuat, suli iluqaisa tautuŋaitchuat uvamnik. "
6538," My goal is that their hearts, having been knit together in love, may be encouraged, and that they may have all the riches that assurance brings in their understanding of the knowledge of the mystery of God, namely, Christ, ",Qapiŋaisaaqtautqugitka atautchimuktitauŋammata piviuttaqqutikun avanmun.

6541," For though I am absent from you in body, I am present with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your morale and the firmness of your faith in Christ. ","Qanuq nayuŋitkaluaŋŋavsi isumamni itqatigiruatun itkivsi, aasii quviasuktuŋa pisigivlugu iñuuniaqatigiigḷuataġniqsi, suli ukpiġurri Christ-mun suaŋapiaġataġman."
6542," Therefore, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, ","Tavra Christ Jesus Atanġum ukpiġutivsigun annautiŋammasi, iñuusiqaġitchi ataramik ukpiqsimaaġlusi ilaanun. "
6543," rooted and built up in him and firm in your faith just as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness.

6544," Be careful not to allow anyone to captivate you through an empty, deceitful philosophy that is according to human traditions and the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.

6545," For in him all the fullness of deity lives in bodily form, ","Qanuq Christ-mi, ilaan timaani, iluqaġmi God iñuuruq. "
6546," and you have been filled in him, who is the head over every ruler and authority. ","Aasii ilivsi atausiŋŋuqatigiŋakavsiuŋ Christ, ilivsivsauq piqaġmiusi iluqaanik God-mik iñuuruamik iḷuvsiññi. Christ kamanaġniqsrauruq aŋalatchiruaq iluqaiññiñ suaŋŋatiniñ naagga ilitqutchiñiñ."
6547," In him you also were circumcised – not, however, with a circumcision performed by human hands, but by the removal of the fleshly body, that is, through the circumcision done by Christ. ","Aasiisuli atausiŋŋuqataukavsi Christ-mun, nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋarusi God-mun iñuksraqtaaguvlusi.

6548," Having been buried with him in baptism, you also have been raised with him through your faith in the power of God who raised him from the dead. ","Qanuq paptaiqsaukavsi piqasiutimmatun piŋarusi tuqqutaanun Christ, piḷuksisuguuruat iñuutchisi iḷuviqatauŋarut ilaanun.

6549," And even though you were dead in your transgressions and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he nevertheless made you alive with him, having forgiven all your transgressions. ","Ilivsi-suli iñuich tuquŋaruatun iñuktun God-mun inŋagaluaqtuasii, qanuq kamagilaił̣ł̣ugich ilaan pitquraŋi, nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaił̣ł̣usiḷu ilaanun iñuginiḷusi.

6550," He has destroyed what was against us, a certificate of indebtedness expressed in decrees opposed to us. He has taken it away by nailing it to the cross. ","Christ tuqukami aŋarraurami piiŋagai tatavsausiaksrautikkaluavut nalliummatiruat uvagut kamaksriŋiññiptiŋnun God-im pitquraŋiñik. God-im tigummatun piŋagai piḷuutivut, aasii kikiaktuutivlugich aŋarrauramun, tainnaqłuni piiŋagai. "
6551," Disarming the rulers and authorities, he has made a public disgrace of them, triumphing over them by the cross.","Aasiisuli, Christ tuqukami akimaŋaruq iluqaiññiñ ilitqusiqł̣uŋniñ atanniqsimanniktuaniñ aŋalatchiruaniḷḷu iñuŋnik.

6554," Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels pass judgment on you. That person goes on at great lengths about what he has supposedly seen, but he is puffed up with empty notions by his fleshly mind. ","Iñuŋmun uqallautipkaġnasi tammaŋaniḷusi qanuq kamanaiyaŋiññavsi ilivsiññik aŋaiyyuvigilugich isaġulgich.

Iluqaġmiŋ pituummiruat niaqqumun navyaatigun nukiktigullu nauqatigiiguurut, God-im naupkaqługich."
6556," If you have died with Christ to the elemental spirits of the world, why do you submit to them as though you lived in the world? ","Christ tuqumman, tuqummatun piŋarusi ilitqutchiñun iñuiḷḷu isummatiġruiññaŋiññun annaurraunikun. Paŋmapak tamatkua aŋalanŋaiŋagaasi.

6559, Even though they have the appearance of wisdom with their self-imposed worship and false humility achieved by an unsparing treatment of the body – a wisdom with no true value – they in reality result in fleshly indulgence.,"Tamatkua pitqurat qiññaqaġumiñaġaluaqtut nakuuruatun, qanuq aŋaiyyupkallavlugich iñuich, suli kamasaaŋaiḷḷavlugich inmiŋnik pitchaiḷiñiapiallavlugich timitiŋ.

6560," Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ, keep seeking the things above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. ","Christ aŋipkaqtaumman tuqqunmiñ, aŋipkaqtauŋammatun ittusi piqatigivlugu ilaa.

6561," Keep thinking about things above, not things on the earth, ",Isumagituiññaqsigik sut tatpaŋmaniittuat. Isumagigiññaŋaiġḷugich sut nunamiittuat. 
6562, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. ,"Qanuq tuquŋaruatun iñuktun ittusi iluqaiññun pigiitchuanun kipiġniuġutinun, iñuggurri iriqsimavluni piqatigivlugu Christ qiḷaŋmiittuaq, God-lu. "
6563," When Christ (who is your life) appears, then you too will be revealed in glory with him. ","Christ iñuggutigikkaqput qiñiġnaqsikpan, ilivsivsauq qiñiġnaqsiqatiginiaġiksi, piqataulusi ilaan kamanautaanun."
6564," So put to death whatever in your nature belongs to the earth: sexual immorality, impurity, shameful passion, evil desire, and greed which is idolatry. ","Tavra tamatkua tainnainmata, iñuusitchi tuqunmatun piḷugich iluqaisa pigiitchuat iḷuvsiññi.

6565, Because of these things the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience. ,Pisigilugu iñuich tainnatchiñik piḷuusiqiniŋat tatavsaġniaġai God-im. 
6566," You also lived your lives in this way at one time, when you used to live among them. ","Qaŋauvlugu iñuuŋŋavsi tamatkunatun iñuktun, tamatkua pisuuŋagaluaġmigisi. "
6567," But now, put off all such things as anger, rage, malice, slander, abusive language from your mouth. ","Aglaan paŋmapak, aġiusigik tamatkua piḷuutit, sunŋusuutit, qinnautit uqautikłiġñiġich pigiitchuanik, saglutillu iñuktigun, salumaitchuaniglu uqaluqaġniġich. "
6568, Do not lie to one another since you have put off the old man with its practices ,"Sagluuŋaiġḷusi avanmun, qanuq paŋmapak aŋalataġiŋaiġaasi piḷuktuat isumavsi piḷġusivsiḷu. Tainna iñuusiqaŋaiŋarusi, "

6570," Here there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave or free, but Christ is all and in all.","Iñuusiġiliutikaptigu taamna nutauruaq iñuusiq, sumiugitchuq akunġanni iñuich, Greek-gugaluaġmata Jew-gugaluaġmatalu, nalunaiñŋutchiŋavlutiglu timimiŋni God-mun naagga nalunaiñŋutchiŋaitkaluaġmata, aglagnik nalugaluaġmata, naagga aŋuyyiqigaluaġmata Scythians-tun, naagga kivgaugaluaġmata kivgauŋitkaluaġmatalu, qanuq Christ naumałhaaqtuq iluqaiññiñ iñuuvluni iluqaiññi ilaan iñuŋmiñi."
6571," Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with a heart of mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, ","Tavra God-im iñuksraqtaaġiŋammasi, piḷuutaiqł̣usi piviuttaġivlusiḷu, kiikaa iḷunŋusuutiqaġitchi allanun, ikayuiruagulusi, kamasaaŋaiġḷusi, paaqłaktautaiḷḷusi qimmaksaliyaiḷḷusiḷu, "

6574," Let the peace of Christ be in control in your heart (for you were in fact called as one body to this peace), and be thankful. ","Aasii aŋuyautairrutim Christ pipkakkaŋata ataramik aŋalallisi, qanuq God-im ququaŋagaasi iḷautquvlusi ativlutiŋ aŋaiyyuliqiruanun, suli iñuuqatigiiquvlusi aŋuyautaiḷḷusi.

6575," Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and exhorting one another with all wisdom, singing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, all with grace in your hearts to God.

6578," Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them. ","Uiguruasii piviuttaġisigik tuvaaqatisi, suammatisuŋaiññaŋaiġḷugich. "
6579," Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing in the Lord. ","Miqłiqtuut, kamagisigik aŋayuqaasi ataramik, qanuq kamaksriñivsi Ataniq iviġaksimaaġaa. "
6580," Fathers, do not provoke your children, so they will not become disheartened. ","Aapauruasii, suasuŋaiññaġnagich miqłiqtusi, qapiŋasiviaqtut kamaksriñiaġniġmiŋni ilivsiññik."
6581," Slaves, obey your earthly masters in every respect, not only when they are watching – like those who are strictly people-pleasers – but with a sincere heart, fearing the Lord. ","Kivgaat, kamaksrisitchi ataramik tamatkuniŋa ilivsi ataniġikkavsiññik, qiñiqtiqaġuvsi kisianik pisuŋaġnasi, iñuŋnik iviġaiñiaqtitun, aglaan ataramik savaglusi iviġaumasuglugu Ataniq. "

6583, because you know that you will receive your inheritance from the Lord as the reward. Serve the Lord Christ. ,"iḷisimaugaġlusi Atanġum akiḷiġñiaġaasi kiŋuvaannaktaamik, qanuq savautigiksi Ataniq Christ. "

6587, because we recall in the presence of our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and endurance of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ. ,"Quyyavigigiga God Aapavut pisigivlugich savaasi qanuq ukpiqtuaguvlusi, suli siġġaqutisi qanuq piviuttaqsrivḷusi, igḷutuutilguniqsiḷu qanuq niġiugiugaqługu qaitqigñiksraŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ. "
6588," We know, brothers and sisters loved by God, that he has chosen you, ","Aniqatiit, God-im piviuttaġiraŋasi, iḷisimarugut God-mun piksraqtaaġiŋatilaavsiññik, "
6589," in that our gospel did not come to you merely in words, but in power and in the Holy Spirit and with deep conviction (surely you recall the character we displayed when we came among you to help you).","qanuq alġaqsruutigikaptigu tusaayugaaġiksuaq ilivsiññun, uqalułhiñakun piŋaitchuq, aglaallu Ilitqusiġiksuam suaŋŋataagun, nalupqinaiqsruutipiaġatakullu. Iḷisimammiusi qanuq iñuuŋatilaaptiŋnik akunnavsiññi ilivsi pisigivlusi. "
6590," And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, when you received the message with joy that comes from the Holy Spirit, despite great affliction. ","Aasii ilivsi piñiarraqsiŋarusiḷi uvaptiktun Ataniqtullu, akuqtuqługu tusaayugaaġiksuaq, quviasuutiqaqłusi Ilitqusiġiksuamiñ, qanutupayauraq nagliksaaqtitaugaluaŋŋavsi. "
6591, As a result you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia. ,"Tainna pikavsi, ilivsi tuvraaksriiŋarusi iluqaiññun ukpiqtuaguruanun Macedonia-mi Greece-miḷu. "
6592," For from you the message of the Lord has echoed forth not just in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place reports of your faith in God have spread, so that we do not need to say anything. ","Qanuq ilivsi siaminŋagiksi tusaayugaaġiksuaq iluqaiññun nunaŋiñun Macedonia-vlu Greece-lu. Aasiisuli tusaayugaaq ukpiġutiqaġnivsigun God-mun siaminŋammiuq sumulliqaa, uvaptiŋnun-unnii quliaqtuaġiraksraiqł̣ugu. "
6593, For people everywhere report how you welcomed us and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God ,"Suli quliaqtuaġutigaatigut qanutun niġummaaŋmatun unnii paġlativsi itilaaŋanik uvaptiŋnun, suli quliaqtuaġivlugu mumiŋatilaaqsi savaurriñivsiññiñ iñuuraqpaŋnik savautisukługu iñuuruaq iḷumullu ittuaq God.

6594," and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus our deliverer from the coming wrath.","Quliaqtuaġimmigaat niġiugniqsi God-im Iġñiŋanik qiḷaŋmiñ, Jesus-mik, ilaan aŋipkaŋaraanik tuqqunmiñ, annaurriruaq uvaptiŋnik God-im tatavsautiksrautaaniñ."
6595," For you yourselves know, brothers and sisters, about our coming to you – it has not proven to be purposeless. ","Qanuq ilivsiññi iḷisimarusi, aniqatiit, ullautiniqput ilivsiññun asiḷiqqutauŋaitchuq. "
6596," But although we suffered earlier and were mistreated in Philippi, as you know, we had the courage in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in spite of much opposition. ",Iḷisimarusi qanutun nagliksaaganiktilaaptiŋnik suli kanŋunaqtuakun aŋalatauŋatilaaptiŋnik Philippi-mi.

6598," but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we declare it, not to please people but God, who examines our hearts. ","aglaan ukpiliquuŋagivsi uvagut God-im iviġaumagivluta, piksraqtaaġiŋammatigullu alġaqsruutigitquvlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq.

6599," For we never appeared with flattering speech, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed – God is our witness – ","Qanuq iḷisimarusi uvagut qaŋaunnii alġaqsruiŋaitchugut iḷamarrutiginiaġlugu, naaggaunnii piŋŋuaġutigilugu kaviuġilugich suġauttasi. God-im taamna iḷisimagaa. "
6600," nor to seek glory from people, either from you or from others, ","Suli alġaqsruiŋitchugut iñuŋnun nanġaquluta, ilivsiññun-unnii naagga allanun. Nalaunŋagaluaġmiuq nanġaquupiaġupta ilivsiññun, uvagut Christ tiliraġivluta. "
6601," although we could have imposed our weight as apostles of Christ; instead we became little children among you. Like a nursing mother caring for her own children, ","Aglaan uvagut piaqłuktaŋaitchugut akunnavsiññi, piḷaaqtitun qaunaksriruatun miqłiqtumiñik. "
6602," with such affection for you we were happy to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us. ","Uvagut piviuttaġiliqpaŋagivsi, piqpaŋnaqsivaił̣ł̣usi uvaptiŋnun piqatigiyumaliŋagivsiunnii iñuggutiptiŋni, piqatigiyumammatuttauq God-im tusaayugaaġiksuaŋanik. "
6603," For you recall, brothers and sisters, our toil and drudgery: By working night and day so as not to impose a burden on any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God. ","Nalupqinaitchuq itqaumatilaaqsi qanutun savaŋatilaaptiŋnik siġġaqiŋatilaaptiŋniglu, aniqatiit, alġaqsruutigikaptigu ilivsiññun tusaayugaaġiksuaŋa God-im savaŋarugut unnuamiḷu uvlumiḷu naŋniġuŋitkaluaqługu nallipayaaqsi pamaġipkaġluta."
6604," You are witnesses, and so is God, as to how holy and righteous and blameless our conduct was toward you who believe. ","Iḷisimarusi, God-ttauq iḷisimammiuq, uvagut iññiqusiqput ilivsiññik ukpiqtuanik piḷuutaiñŋaruq, suli nalaunŋavluni, pasiñaġumiñaił̣ł̣uniḷu. "
6605," As you know, we treated each one of you as a father treats his own children, ","Qanuq iḷisimarusi aŋalanŋagivsi aapauruaq miqłiqtumiñik aŋalatchiruatun iḷivḷuta. Uvagut siḷġiqsuŋammigivsi qapiŋaisaaqłusiḷu pitquripiaqłuta ilivsiññik atausiullaavlusi, "

6607," And so we too constantly thank God that when you received God’s message that you heard from us, you accepted it not as a human message, but as it truly is, God’s message, which is at work among you who believe. ","Aasiisuli quyyavigimmigikput God ataramik uumuuna, ilivsi akuqtuqavsiuŋ uqalua God-im tusaaŋakkaqsi uvaptiŋniñ, akuqtuŋaitkiksi uqalugipkaqtaġlugu iñuŋnun aglaan irrusipiaġataŋatun, uqalua God-im, savaktuaq ilivsiññi ukpiqtuani. "
6608," For you became imitators, brothers and sisters, of God’s churches in Christ Jesus that are in Judea, because you too suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they in fact did from the Jews, ","Qanuq tuvrautirraqsiŋarusi aŋaiyyuliqiruaŋiñun God-im Judea-miittuanun, atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruanun Christ-mun.

6611," But when we were separated from you, brothers and sisters, for a short time (in presence, not in affection) we became all the more fervent in our great desire to see you in person. ","Aniqatiit, aullaqapta ilivsiññiñ piisaaqtuallaanikapta piigulaił̣ł̣usi sumikunnii tautuvsaaġupiaŋagivsi, tavraasii utiġniapiaŋagaluaqtugut ilivsiññun. "
6612," For we wanted to come to you (I, Paul, in fact tried again and again) but Satan thwarted us. ","Uvaŋa Paul ullagupiaġaluaġivsi. Qaiñiatatqigaaġaluaqtuŋa, Satan piñaiḷutchiqsuġaaŋa. "
6613, For who is our hope or joy or crown to boast of before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not of course you? ,Uvvami sum niġiuktitpatigut quviasukkumaaqtiłłutalu kanŋusuksaġumaaŋił̣ł̣utalu sivuġaani Atanipta Jesus ilaa qaikpan? Ilivsi.

6616," We sent Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen you and encourage you about your faith, ","aasii tiliŋagikput Timothy, aniqatikput, God-im kivgaŋa alġaqsruiñiġmun tusaayugaaġiksuaŋanik Christ, suaŋasiḷaaquvlusi ukpiġutivsiññi qapiŋaisaaġlusiḷu, "
6617, so that no one would be shaken by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this. ,iñuŋmun kimulliqaa nipuqsaquŋił̣ł̣usi ukpiġniksravsiññiñ tamatkua nagliksaaqtirrusiat piŋŋaisa. Ilivsi ilivsiññi iḷisimarusi piksraqtaaguŋatilaavsiññik nalautaksraġivlugu nagliksaaqtitauniq. 
6618," For in fact when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we would suffer affliction, and so it has happened, as you well know. ","Qanuq nayuutiŋŋapta ilivsiññun, uqautiŋagivsi sivuani nagliksaaqtitauniaġnivḷuta. Taamna nalaurraqsiŋaruq iḷisimammiusi. "
6619," So when I could bear it no longer, I sent to find out about your faith, for fear that the tempter somehow tempted you and our toil had proven useless.","Tavra igḷutulguiḷigaluaqapku uŋiarrisiga ilivsigun, tiliŋagiga Timothy iḷitchuġiyaqtuquvlugu ukpiġutivsiññi qapiŋaitkaluaġmagaavsisuli, piŋiksraqłuŋa iḷaanni qanutchikun Tuunġaġmun killuqsaqtinniaġasugalusi, aasii uvagut siġġaqutikput alġaqsruikapta ilivsiññun anniqsuutauŋaiġñiaġasugalugu."
6620, But now Timothy has come to us from you and given us the good news of your faith and love and that you always think of us with affection and long to see us just as we also long to see you! ,"Paŋmapak-aasii Timothy utiŋaruq ilivsiññiñ, aasii quliaqtuaġutivluta tusaayugaalluatanik ilivsi ukpiġutivsigun piviuttaqqutivsigullu.

6621," So in all our distress and affliction, we were reassured about you, brothers and sisters, through your faith. ","Tamatkua iluqaġmiŋ tusaayugaalluatat ilivsigun ukpiġutiqaqtuiññaġnivsigullu qapiŋaiqsaaŋagaanŋa, qanutupayauraq iłuiḷḷiuqtitaugaluaqtilluŋa nagliksaaqtitauvluŋalu. "
6622," For now we are alive again, if you stand firm in the Lord. ",Igḷutuġumiñaqsigiga sunapayauraq iḷitchuġianikama ukpiġutiqaqtilaavsiññik suli suaŋaruamik Ataniġmi. 
6623," For how can we thank God enough for you, for all the joy we feel because of you before our God? ",Quviatchapiaġataġivsiŋa sivuġaani God-ima. Qanutun quyyavigiyumiñaqtigigiga God naamasiḷugu quyyatigilusi. 
6624, We pray earnestly night and day to see you in person and make up what may be lacking in your faith.,"Unnuakkaluami uvlukkaluamiḷu aŋaiyyuupiaġuuruŋa tautuvsaaġukłusi, aasii iḷisautilusi sunik iḷitchuġiŋaisavsiññik ukpiġutiqaġnikullu Christ-mi."
6625, Now may God our Father himself and our Lord Jesus direct our way to you. ,"Paŋmapaktuq God-ipta Aapam ilaan, Ataniptalu Jesus, sivunniġḷiuŋ iglauyaaksraqput ilivsiññun, "
6626," And may the Lord cause you to increase and abound in love for one another and for all, just as we do for you, ","aasiisuli, Atanġuptuq aglipkavsaasuġrugliuŋ piviuttaqqutiniqsi avanmun, allanullu iñupayaanun, uvaguttauq piviuttaqqutiqaqtilaaptiktun ilivsiññun. "
6627, so that your hearts are strengthened in holiness to be blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.,"Tainna piguvsi, tuniqsimaniaqtusi ukpiġutivsiññi pasirauniaŋiḷḷusi, suli piḷuutaiḷḷusi, akuqtuġnaġumiñaġniaqtusi God-mun Aapaptiŋnun Ataniqput Jesus qaikpan piqatigilugich iluqaisa ilaan ilaaguaqtauŋaruat iñuŋni."
6628," Finally then, brothers and sisters, we ask you and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received instruction from us about how you must live and please God (as you are in fact living) that you do so more and more. ","Aasiisuli aniqatiit, kiiqsruġivsi siḷġiqsuqłusiḷu atausiŋŋuqatigianiŋakavsiuŋ Ataniq Jesus, iñuutquvlusi tuvraġlugu iḷisaurrutikput ilivsiññun, iviġaumagikkaŋa God-im. Tainna iñuusaaniŋagaluaġmiusi, aglaan uvaŋa sivunmuktuġlusisuli iñuutqugivsi. "
6629, For you know what commands we gave you through the Lord Jesus. ,Qanuq iḷisimagisi sut iḷisaurrutigiŋaravut ilivsiññun ataniġnaqutaagun Atanġum Jesus. 
6630," For this is God’s will: that you become holy, that you keep away from sexual immorality, ","God-im iñuutqugaasi iñuusiqaġlusi ilaaguaqtauŋaruanik inmiñun, iḷaksiaŋaiġḷugu allatuun, "
6631," that each of you know how to possess his own body in holiness and honor, ","ilivsi atausiullaalusi iḷisimatquvlusi qanuq qaunaginaqtilaamik inmun, piḷuutaiññiaqłuni, suli nalliummatiluni God-mun pigiyumiñaqsiḷuni. "
6632, not in lustful passion like the Gentiles who do not know God. ,"Aŋalatinnasi kipiġniuġutivsiññun allatuġumiñaqsiḷusi, ukpiŋaitchuatitun iñuktun naluruatun God-mik. "
6633," In this matter no one should violate the rights of his brother or take advantage of him, because the Lord is the avenger in all these cases, as we also told you earlier and warned you solemnly. ","Tavra kiñaliqaa kamaksriŋiññami aasii saglutaġlugu aniqatini allatuaġilugu tuvaaqataa, qanuq Atanġum tatavsaġniaġai iluqaisa tainna piruat, kiliktuammaġiksaaŋagivsiusi taavruma sivuani. "
6634, For God did not call us to impurity but in holiness. ,"Qanuq uvva God-im sivunniutigiŋaitkaa uvagut iñuutquluta piḷuunmi, aglaan iñuuniaquvluta piḷuutaiḷḷuta. "
6635," Consequently the one who rejects this is not rejecting human authority but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.","Taamna pisigilugu, kiñaliqaa iñuusuŋitchuaq kamagilugich taapkua pitqurat, kipuqłaiŋitchuq iñuŋmik aglaan God-mik, aitchuiruamik Ilitqusiġiksuamiñik ilivsiññun."
6636," Now on the topic of brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another. ","Sivuniġilugu piviuttaqqutaat aniqatit, tuyuqtituŋitchusi kimigliqaa qanuq ilivsi ilivsiññi iḷisaurrusiaqaŋarusi God-miñ piviuttaqqutitquvlusi avanmun, "
6637," And indeed you are practicing it toward all the brothers and sisters in all of Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers and sisters, to do so more and more, ","aasiami iḷumutun piviuttaġigisi iluqaisa aniqatit iluqaani Macedonia-miittuat. Aglaan aniqatiit, uvagut siḷġiqsuġivsi kiikaasuli piviuttaqqutitquvlusi. "
6638," to aspire to lead a quiet life, to attend to your own business, and to work with your hands, as we commanded you. ","Kipiġniuttaġiqpaksiuŋ iñuusuglusi piallataiḷḷusi, suli iḷaksiaŋaiġḷugich allat iñuich, akiññagniḷuglusi iñuuniḷuutiksravsiññik, tuvraġlugu piraksriutikput ilivsiññun. "
6639, In this way you will live a decent life before outsiders and not be in need.,"Taamna piguvsiuŋ, ukpiŋaitchuat isummatigilluataġniaġaasi, suli ilivsi nayummatiqaġniaŋitchusi pamatillusi allanun iñuŋnun."
6640," Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers and sisters, about those who are asleep, so that you will not grieve like the rest who have no hope. ","Aniqatiit, paŋmapak aglaksaqtuŋa sivuniġivlugich siñiktuat tuqqunmi. Iḷisimalluataqugiga taamna ilivsiññun, isumaaqpaquŋił̣ł̣usi allatun iñuktitun niġiugaitchuatun iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. "
6641," For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also we believe that God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep as Christians. ","Ukpiġikaptigu Jesus tuquŋanivḷugu aasii aŋimmivḷuni, tainnatuttauq ukpiġiyumiñaġmigikput Jesus qaitqikpan, God-mun qaiqatigipkaġniaġniḷugich ilaanun tamatkua siñiksaŋaruat tuqqunmi. "
6642," For we tell you this by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will surely not go ahead of those who have fallen asleep. ","Uqallautigivsi iiguliktauŋitchuamik Atanġum uqallautaanik uvamnun, uvagurguuq iñuuruaguut iñuuniġupta Atanġum qaitqigñiŋanunaglaan, sivulikkumiñaitkivut tamatkua siñiktuat tuqqunmi. "
6643," For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a shout of command, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ will rise first. ","Qanuq Ataniq ilaa atqaġniaqtuq qiḷaŋmiñ ququullatigilugu kamanaqtuaq piraksriun, qaukłiata isaġulgich ququullataanik, suli nipaanik God-im nipauqłuktautaata. Aasii tuquŋaruat, atausiŋŋuqatigiŋavlugu Christ, aŋiqqaaġniaqtut. "
6644," Then we who are alive, who are left, will be suddenly caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will always be with the Lord. ","Aasiiḷi uvagut iñuuruaguut mayuurrauniaqtugut piqatigilugich nuvuyanun, paaġlugu Ataniq siḷami, aasii nayuaqsiḷugu ilaa isuitchuamun. "
6645, Therefore encourage one another with these words.,Quviasaaġutisitchi avanmun taapkuniŋa uqaluŋnik.
6646," From Paul and Silvanus and Timothy, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ","Paul-lu Silvanus-lu Timothy-lu tuyuqtut ukuniŋa tuyuutinik aŋaiyyuliqiruanun iniqpaŋmi atiqaqtuami Thessalonica-mik, tamatkunuŋa atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruanun God-mun Aapaptiŋnun, Ataniġmullu Jesus Christ-mun. "
6647, Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! ,Nagliktuusiaqpaqaġitchisuq tutqiunmiglu God-miñ Aapamiñ Ataniġmiḷḷu Jesus Christ-miñ.
6648," We ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters, and rightly so, because your faith flourishes more and more and the love of each one of you all for one another is ever greater. ","Aniqatiit, nalaunŋaruq uvagut quyyavigiguptigu God quyyatigilusi.

6649, As a result we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your perseverance and faith in all the persecutions and afflictions you are enduring.,"Aasiuvva uvagut quliaqtuaġilluataġivsi aŋaiyyuliqiruanun God-mun, quliaqtuaġutivlugich qiñuirrutivsiññik ukpiġutivsiññiglu, igḷutuġluataqavsigik qanusipayaat nagliksaaqtirrusiat iłuiḷḷiuġutillu. "
6650," This is evidence of God’s righteous judgment, to make you worthy of the kingdom of God, for which in fact you are suffering. ","Tamatkua nalupqinaiyautaurut God-im nalaunŋaruakun isivġiutaanun, qanuq uvva ilaan nagliksaaqtitaupkaġaasi nalliummatiliquvlusi piqatauniksravsiññun ilaan atanniqsimmataani. "
6651," For it is right for God to repay with affliction those who afflict you, ","Tavra God isivġiiḷḷavluni nalaunŋaruakun, ilaan paaqłiġñiaġai iłuiḷḷiuġunmik tamatkua iłuiḷḷiuqtitchiruat ilivsiññik, "
6652, and to you who are being afflicted to give rest together with us when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels. ,"aasiiḷi ilivsi iłuiḷḷiuqtitauruasii unaŋuiqsiqatigipkaġlusi uvaptiŋnun.

6653, With flaming fire he will mete out punishment on those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. ,"nalaunŋaruakun akisaġvigisuglugich tamatkua naluruat God-mik, tamatkualu akuqtuiŋaitchuat tusaayugaaġiksuamik Ataniptigun Jesus-kun. "
6654," They will undergo the penalty of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his strength, ","Tainnatchich iñuich tatavsaqtauniaqtut isuitchuamik tammaunmik, piiqsauŋalutiŋ Atanġum irvianiñ, qaummaġikpaktuamiḷḷu suaŋŋataaniñ, "
6655, when he comes to be glorified among his saints and admired on that day among all who have believed – and you did in fact believe our testimony. ,"taavrumani uvlumi qaigumi nanġausiaqaġiaġluni kamanaqsipkaqtauyyaġluniḷu ilaaguaqtauruaniñ iñuŋmiñiñ, kamasuuttaġipkaġiaġluniḷu iluqaiññun ukpiliŋaruanun, ilivsi iḷagilusi, qanuq ukpiġiŋagiksi alġaqsruutikput. "
6656," And in this regard we pray for you always, that our God will make you worthy of his calling and fulfill by his power your every desire for goodness and every work of faith, ","Ataramik aŋaiyyutisuugivsi, aŋaiyyuvigivlugu God-ikput ilaanun nalliummatiliqsitquvlusi miqłiqtuġiyumiñaqsiḷusi, ilaan suaŋŋataagullu taŋŋiqsitaquvlugich savaalluatapayaurat piyumakkasi pianikkasiḷu ukpiġurri pisigivlugu. "
6657," that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.","Tainnauvva piguvsi Ataniqput Jesus nanġausiaqaqtinniaġiksi, aasiivsauq ilaata ilivsi nanġaġlusi. Taamnauvva nagliktauvlutik sivunniuġutigiŋagaak God-ipta Atanġuvlu Jesus Christ."
6658," Now regarding the arrival of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered to be with him, we ask you, brothers and sisters, ","Paŋmapak tuyuġivsi aglaŋnik sivuniġivlugu qaiñiksraŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ, uvagullu katinniksraptigun paaqsaġlugu ilaa. "
6659," not to be easily shaken from your composure or disturbed by any kind of spirit or message or letter allegedly from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord is already here. ","Aniqatiit, nalupqitchaquŋipiaġivsi naagga iłuiḷḷiuġutiginagu isummiġḷusi Atanġum isivġiiviksrautaa isagutisaaniŋniḷugu.

"
6660," Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not arrive until the rebellion comes and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction. ","Kimulliqaa qanupayaaq sagluqipkaġnasi.

6661," He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god or object of worship, and as a result he takes his seat in God’s temple, displaying himself as God. ","Taamna iñuk akiḷḷiḷiqsuiñiaqtuq qanusipayauramik god-mik, naagga supayaamik iñuich aŋaiyyuvigikkaŋannik, inmiñun kamanałhaaqtualiuġluni tamatkunaŋŋa.

6662, Surely you recall that I used to tell you these things while I was still with you. ,Nalupqigiŋitkiga itqaumatilaaqsi taavrumuuna uqautimnik ilivsiññun nayuŋŋavsi. 
6663," And so you know what holds him back, so that he will be revealed in his own time. ",Aasii itqaġumiñaqtusi sumun pitchaiḷiraqtilaaŋanik paŋmapak salapqiġñiksraŋa sivuani salapqiġviksrautaata. 
6664," For the hidden power of lawlessness is already at work. However, the one who holds him back will do so until he is taken out of the way, ","Qanuq uvva qiñiġnaitchuaq suaŋŋataa pigiitchuam savaksaaniŋagaluaqtillugu, taamna paŋmapak pitchaiḷiraġniktuaq piñaiḷutchiqsuiñiaqtuq suli piiqsauniġmiñunaglaan. "
6665," and then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy by the breath of his mouth and wipe out by the manifestation of his arrival. ","Taamna piñaiḷutchiqsuiruaq piiqpan, tavrani satqummiġñiaqtuq iñuk piḷupiaġataqtuaq. Aasii taamna iñuk Atanġum Jesus tuqunniaġaa aniġniġmiñik, suksraunġiġḷugu qaumaniġmiñik qaigumi. "
6666," The arrival of the lawless one will be by Satan’s working with all kinds of miracles and signs and false wonders, ","Taamna piḷupiaġataqtuaq iñuk qaiñiaqtuq suaŋŋatiqaġluni Satan suaŋŋataanik, nalupqinaiyaġlugu suaŋŋatiqaqtilaani aliuġnaqtualiqiluni sagluqqutinik iñuŋnun. "
6667," and with every kind of evil deception directed against those who are perishing, because they found no place in their hearts for the truth so as to be saved. ","Ilaan pigiitchuakun sagluqiniaġai tamatkiġḷugich suksrauyumaaqtuat, qanuq iliŋisa piviuttaġiŋaitkaat iḷumun ittuaq annautiksraġaluaqtiŋ. "
6668, Consequently God sends on them a deluding influence so that they will believe what is false. ,"Aasii ukpiġisuŋiñmarruŋ iḷumun ittuaq, God-im sagluqiraupkaġniaġai, taimmaasii iliŋisa ukpiġilipiallaglugu iḷumun inŋitchuaq. "
6669, And so all of them who have not believed the truth but have delighted in evil will be condemned.,"Aasii taamna pisigilugu iliŋich suksraunġiqsauniaqtut, iluqaġmiŋ tamatkua ukpiqsraŋitchuat iḷumun ittuamik God-ikun, aglaan iñuuruat aliitkutigivlugu piḷuun."
6670," But we ought to thank God always for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and faith in the truth. ","Aglaalli uvagut ataramik quyyatiqaqtuksraupiaqtugut God-mun quyyatigilusi, aniqatiit Atanġum piviuttaġikkaŋasi, qanuq taimaŋŋaqaŋa God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagaasi annaurrautquvlusi, ilaaguaqłusi inmiñun Ilitqusiġiksuakun, ukpiġiliqavsiuŋ iḷumun ittuaq.

6672," Therefore, brothers and sisters, stand firm and hold on to the traditions that we taught you, whether by speech or by letter. ","Taamna pisigilugu, aniqatiit, asiñuurraunasi. Tuniqsimavigisigik ukpiġilugich iḷisaurrutivut ilivsiññun nayuŋŋavsi, ami tuyuutivullu. "
6673," Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope, ","Paŋmapaktuq qapiŋaisaaġusiaqaġitchi Ataniptiŋniñ Jesus Christ-miñ God-miḷḷu aapaptiŋniñ, piviuttaqsriŋaruaŋniñ uvaptiŋnik tilivḷugu Iġñini annautitquvluta, qapiŋaisaaqtuaqtiptiŋniñ ataramik, suli piyummatiqaqtitchiruaŋniñ quvianaqtuamik iliŋikta nagliktuutiqpaŋmikkun.

6675," From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope, ","Ukua tuyuutit tuyuġigai Paul, tilirautquŋakkaŋata piraksriivḷuni God-im Annaurriptalu Jesus Christ annagummatigikkapta. "
6676," to Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!","Tuyuutaurut iliŋnun Timothy, iġñipiaġataptun ittuamun ukpiliqsinŋavlutin Christ-mun. God-tiptuq Aapam Christ-lu Jesus Atanipta iviġaummatigilisin nagligilutillu tutqiutiqaqtillutillu."
6677," As I urged you when I was leaving for Macedonia, stay on in Ephesus to instruct certain people not to spread false teachings, ","Ephesus-miitqugikpiñ, taimanisun Macedonia-muksaqama apiġipiaŋavlutin.

6678, nor to occupy themselves with myths and interminable genealogies. Such things promote useless speculations rather than God’s redemptive plan that operates by faith. ,"Uqautilugich aptatiqaŋaiqulugich unipkaalianik, maŋŋuumiŋniglu takisipiaġataqługich atiqaġviḷiamiŋnik, qanuq tamatkua aguirrutaugiññaġuurut uqaġlaqutiksranun, ikayuutaulaitchut nalautchiñiaġniġmun God-im sivunniuġutiŋiñik, ukpiġunmullu agliḷaaġutaulutiŋ piḷaitchut.

6679," But the aim of our instruction is love that comes from a pure heart, a good conscience, and a sincere faith. ","Piraksriġikpiñ uqallautitquvlugich iñuich piviuttaqqutimmaġiksaaliquvlugich avanmun, naġġutchaktaŋaiġḷutiŋ isumamiŋni, suli suaŋaruamik ukpiġutiqaquvlugich. "
6680, Some have strayed from these and turned away to empty discussion. ,Iḷaŋich iñuich saquŋarut iḷumun ittuaniñ taŋiġitchuanun uqavaaġutinun. 
6681," They want to be teachers of the law, but they do not understand what they are saying or the things they insist on so confidently.","Kipiġniuqtut iḷisaurrausukłutiŋ God-im pitquraŋiñik, kaŋiqsigaluaġnagich nallipayaaŋich uqaluŋmiŋ naagga sutigun uqautigikkaġmikkun nalupqinaigivlugich."
6682," But we know that the law is good if someone uses it legitimately, ","Paŋmapak iḷisimarugut pitqurat nakuutilaaŋannik, kialiqaa atuqpagich God-im sivunniutaatun. "
6683," realizing that law is not intended for a righteous person, but for lawless and rebellious people, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who kill their fathers or mothers, for murderers, ","Qanuq iḷisimarusi God-im pitquraŋi pitquraliaguŋisilaaŋannik iñuŋnun nalaunŋaruanun sivuġaani God-im.

6707, For Adam was formed first and then Eve. ,"Qanuq Adam iñuġuqtitauqqaaŋaruq, maanna Eve. "

6726,"He was revealed in the flesh,",

6728,"seen by angels,",
6729,"proclaimed among Gentiles,",
6730,"believed on in the world,",
6731,taken up in glory.,
6732," Now the Spirit explicitly says that in the later times some will desert the faith and occupy themselves with deceiving spirits and demonic teachings, ","Ilitqusiġiksuam nalupqinaiqł̣ugu uqallausiġigai iñuich iḷaŋich ukpiġutaiġñiaġnivḷugich aqulliġñi uvluni, kamagilugich sagluqinniktuat ilitqutchich, maliġuaġlutiglu ilitqusiqł̣uich iḷisaurrutiŋiññik.

6735, For every creation of God is good and no food is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. ,"Qanuq supayaat savaaġiŋarai God-im nakuurut, suli sunaliqaa ayyagaksrauŋitchuq, aglaan akuqtugaksrauruq quyyatigilugu aŋaiyyutikun, "
6736, For it is sanctified by God’s word and by prayer.,qanuq uqaluata God-im aŋaiyyutivlu akuqtuġnaġumiñaqsigaak God-mun.

6738," But reject those myths fit only for the godless and gullible, and train yourself for godliness. ",Iḷaksianagich god-taiḷautikun ittuat asiḷiqqutikullu unipkaat. Ayuġaksaġiñ iliŋnik iñuusuglutin God-im iñuutqutaagun iliŋnun.

6742, Command and teach these things. ,Tamatkua iñuŋnun piraksriutigikkich iḷisaurrutigilugiḷḷu.

Tainna pituiññaġuvich, annautipkallasiñiaqtutin iliŋnun tamatkualu tusaaruat iliŋnik."
6748," Do not address an older man harshly but appeal to him as a father. Speak to younger men as brothers, ",Suaŋnagu utuqqanaaq aglaan araktuaġuŋ aapagimmatun. Aŋalatkich nukatpiat aniqatiktun iḷiḷugich.

6750, Honor widows who are truly in need. ,Suuŋiḷaġinagich uiḷgaŋaruat ikayuqtiqaqtuksraupiaqtuat. 
6751," But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they should first learn to fulfill their duty toward their own household and so repay their parents what is owed them. For this is what pleases God. ","Uiḷgaŋaruaq miqłiqtuqaqpan naagga tutaaluuqaqpan piḷḷasiŋaruanik, tamatkua qaunagilirruŋ ilaa, puttuqsriḷutiŋ tainna pigumiŋ paaqłiiñiḷuktilaamiŋnik aŋayuqaamiŋnik ataataamiŋniglu, aasii tainna pikamiŋ savaurrirut God-mik, iviġakługulu. "
6752," But the widow who is truly in need, and completely on her own, has set her hope on God and continues in her pleas and prayers night and day. ","Aġnaq uiḷgaŋaruaq qaunaksriksraił̣ł̣uni niġiuktuaguruq ikayuusiaksramiñik God-miñ, aasii aŋaiyyuuqłuni apiġivlugu unnuakkaluami uvlumiḷu ilaanun ikayuquvluni. "

6754," Reinforce these commands, so that they will be beyond reproach. ","Taavrumiŋa piraksrikkich, pasiñaġumiñaitchumaut. "
6755," But if someone does not provide for his own, especially his own family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.","Kiñaliqaa pamatchiŋitkumi nanmiñiġmiñik, taapkuniŋałhaaqami nanmiñiq qitunġamiñik, iñuuŋitchuq tuvraġlugu ukpiġikkaqput, aasii pigiił̣haaqtuq unnii ukpiŋaitchuamiñ."

6759, and so incur judgment for breaking their former pledge. ,aasii tainna pikamiŋ pasiraurut navguiñikun unniqsuqłiisiqqaamiŋnik ilaanun.

6767," Those guilty of sin must be rebuked before all, as a warning to the rest. ","Tamatkuali sivunmuuruat piḷuunmi, suakkich takkuanni iñuich iluqaġmiŋ, kisiŋŋuqtat piḷuksiŋitchuat sivuuqqatiqaġumaut piḷuksiñiksramun."
6768," Before God and Christ Jesus and the elect angels, I solemnly charge you to carry out these commands without prejudice or favoritism of any kind. ","Takkuaŋni God-im Christ-lu Jesus piḷuutaitchuallu isaġulgich, piraksripiaġikpiñ kamagitquvlugich tamatkua piraksriutitka, iñuich iḷaŋich iviġaumagiłhaaŋaiġḷugich allaniñ iñuŋniñ supayaatigun ilivich pikkapkun. "
6769, Do not lay hands on anyone hastily and so identify with the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. ,Qilamiqsruuttaġinagu iḷisiñiaġniq argaŋnik ilaaguaqsiñiksramun iñuŋmik savaaŋanun Atanġum. Patchisauyumiñaqsiñak allat iñuich piḷuutiŋiññun. Qaunakkuiñ iliŋnik piḷuutaitchuglutin.

6771," The sins of some people are obvious, going before them into judgment, but for others, they show up later. ","Piḷuutiŋich iñuich iḷaŋisa nalunaitchut, aasii taamna pisigilugu nalupqinaitchuq isivġiqsauniaqtut. Aglaan piḷuutiŋich allat iḷisimanaqsiñiaqtut aquvatigun. "
6772," Similarly good works are also obvious, and the ones that are not cannot remain hidden.","Tainnatuttauq savaalluatat nalunaiñmiut, nalunaiñŋitkaluaġumikunnii iriqsimaanikkumiñaitchut."
6773," From Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, to further the promise of life in Christ Jesus, ","Ukua tuyuutit iliŋnun qairut Paul-miñ, Jesus Christ tiliraŋaniñ, qanuq God tainna pitqurimman. Paul tilirauŋaruq quliaqtuaġitquvlugu unniqsuqłiisauŋaruaq iñuggun pigiliutisuukkaqput atausiŋŋuqatigikaptigu Christ Jesus. "
6774," to Timothy, my dear child. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord!","Tuyuutaurut Timothy-mun piqpagivlugu iġñiġimmatun itamnun. God-im Aapauruam Christ Jesus-lu Atanipta iviġaumanautilisin, nagligilisin, tutqiutiqaqtillisillu."
6775," I am thankful to God, whom I have served with a clear conscience as my ancestors did, when I remember you in my prayers as I do constantly night and day. ","Quyyavigigiga God savautikkaġa naġġukkutaitchuakun isumami, isumaqausiatitun maŋŋuuma. Quyyavigigiga ataramik aŋaiyyutimni unnuakkaluami uvlumiḷu, "
6776," As I remember your tears, I long to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. ","itqaqapkulu qulviŋatilaan, kipiġniuqtuŋa tautugukłutin, quviatchakpagukłuŋa. "
6777," I recall your sincere faith that was alive first in your grandmother Lois and in your mother Eunice, and I am sure is in you.","Itqaġiga iḷumutuuqtuamik ukpiġutiqaqtilaan, ukpiġutiqausiatun aanavich Lois aakaviḷḷu Eunice. Aasii paŋmapak nalupqisuŋitchuŋa ukpiġutiqaġmiutin. "
6778, Because of this I remind you to rekindle God’s gift that you possess through the laying on of my hands. ,"Taamna pisigivlugu, itqaqtitchukkikpiñ igliqtitquvlugu God-im aitchuutaa iḷikapkich argatka iliŋnun. "
6779, For God did not give us a Spirit of fear but of power and love and self-control. ,"Qanuq Ilitqusiġiksuam God-im aitchuutaata iqsisaiġaatigut suaŋŋasiŋagaatigullu, piviuttaqqusiqł̣utalu, uvaptiŋniglu aŋalalluataġumiñaqsivḷuta."
6780," So do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, a prisoner for his sake, but by God’s power accept your share of suffering for the gospel. ","Kanŋutchaktitaunak quliaqtuaġigupku Ataniqput, naaggaunnii uvaŋa tigutaaqtauruaŋaa alġaqsruiñiġa pisigivlugu, aglaan akuqtuġuŋ nagliksaaġniġiñ pisigivlugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq, qanutun God-im suaŋŋasiqsuqpatin. "
6781," He is the one who saved us and called us with a holy calling, not based on our works but on his own purpose and grace, granted to us in Christ Jesus before time began, ","God-im annautiŋagaatigut suli ququaqłuta ilaan iñuggusiqł̣uta pisigisuŋaġnagich uvagut savaavut, aglaan pisigivlugu ilaan sivunniutini nagliktuutiqpaniḷu.

6782, but now made visible through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He has broken the power of death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel! ,aasii paŋmapak salapqiqł̣ugu niptaġniŋagun Annaurripta Christ Jesus. Christ-gum suksraunġiŋagaa tuqqun aasii qaġġisivlugu iñuggun tuqunaitchuaq tusaayugaaġiksuakun.

6784," Because of this, in fact, I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, because I know the one in whom my faith is set and I am convinced that he is able to protect what has been entrusted to me until that day. ","Aasii taamna pisigivlugu nagliksaaqtuŋa nagliksaaġusivsun.

6785, Hold to the standard of sound words that you heard from me and do so with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. ,"Ukpiġiŋaiġñagich iḷumun ittuat uqaluich iḷisaurrutitka iliŋnun, maliġuagaksratin iñuuniaġuvich, ukpiġutiqaqtuiññaġlutin piviuttaqqutiqaġlutillu pigikkaptiŋnik atausiŋŋuqatigikaptigu Christ Jesus.

6788," May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my imprisonment. ","Atanġuptuq nagligiligich igluqatiŋi Onesiphorus, qanuq ilaan akulaitchuami qapiŋaisaaġuugaaŋa. Ilaan kanŋusuutigiŋaitkaaŋa pisigilugu tigutaaqtauniġa, "
6789," But when he arrived in Rome, he eagerly searched for me and found me. ","aglaan tikipqauraqami Rome-mun ilaan ivaŋagaaŋa, aasii paqiłłuŋa. "
6790, May the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day! And you know very well all the ways he served me in Ephesus.,Atanġuptuq nagliktuusiaqaqtilliuŋ Ataniġmiñ isivġiġviŋmi. Iḷisimalluataqtutin qanutun ikayuisilaaŋanik uvamnik Ephesus-mi.
6791," So you, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. ","Ilivich aasii, iġñiiŋ, qapiŋairrutiqaġiñ savaaġni nagliktuusiaqpakun pigikkaptigun atausiŋŋuqatigikaptigu Christ Jesus. "
6792, And entrust what you heard me say in the presence of many others as witnesses to faithful people who will be competent to teach others as well. ,"Uqaluich tusaaŋakkatin uvamniñ alġaqsruikama iñugiaktuanun iñuŋnun, ilivich qaaŋiqsitkich pigitqulugich iñuŋnun nalupqigiŋisaġnun iḷisaurriyumiñaqtuanun allaniktauq iñuŋnik."
6793, Take your share of suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus. ,Piqasiuttuiñ nagliksaaġniġmi pisigilugu tusaayugaaġiksuaq aŋuyaktigiksuaŋatun Christ Jesus. 
6794, No one in military service gets entangled in matters of everyday life; otherwise he will not please the one who recruited him. ,"Aŋuyakti aŋuyaktaullaġmi aptatiqalaitchuq aŋuyaktauŋitchuam savaaŋiñik, qanuq ilaan iviġagukkaa aŋuyaktini atanaurani. "
6795," Also, if anyone competes as an athlete, he will not be crowned as the winner unless he competes according to the rules. ",Aqpaliurraqti aqpaliurraqtuaq akiññalaitchuq isagunŋaŋisuaqami nalaullugich pitqurriutit aqpaliurraġniġmi. 
6796, The farmer who works hard ought to have the first share of the crops. ,Nautchiriqiri siġḷiqiruaq savakami piqaqqaaqtuksrauruq sivulliġñik nauruanik. 
6797, Think about what I am saying and the Lord will give you understanding of all this.,"Isumalaaġutigikkich sut uqautigikkatka uuktuutit, qanuq Atanġum kaŋiqsipkaġniaġaatin taapkunuuna uqautigikkapkun."
6798," Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, a descendant of David; such is my gospel, ","Itqaumauŋ Jesus Christ, aŋipkaqtauŋaruaq tuqqunmiñ, maŋŋuqaqtuaq David-miñ, alġaqsruutiptun tusaayugaaġiksuanik. "
6799," for which I suffer hardship to the point of imprisonment as a criminal, but God’s message is not imprisoned! ","Alġaqsruutigikkaġa tusaayugaaġiksuaq pisigivlugu nagliksaaqtuŋa, tigutaaqtauruŋaunnii pitquranik navguiritun. Aglaan God-im uqalua piñaiḷutaitchuq. "
6800," So I endure all things for the sake of those chosen by God, that they too may obtain salvation in Christ Jesus and its eternal glory. ","Taamna pisigivlugu igḷutuġitka supayaat pisigivlugich God-im iñuksraqtaaŋi, iliŋitchauq annaurrautquvlugich Christ Jesus-kun, iñuutquvlugiḷḷu qiḷaŋmi isuitchuamun. "

6802,"If we died with him, we will also live with him.","Itqaqtittaġukkich iñuktin taavrumiŋa, suli kiliglugich sivuġaani Atanġum pitchaiḷitqulugich uqaluŋnik qanaaġutiksrauruanik. Anniqsuutaulaitchut, aglaan maqutchisuurut iñuŋnik naalaġniruanik. "

6804,"If we deny him, he will also deny us.","Uqavaaqatiginagich god-taitchuat asiḷiqqutikullu uqavaaqtuat. Qanuq uŋusiññaġuugaich iñuich god-taiḷaġniġmun, "
6805," If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, since he cannot deny himself.",iḷisaurrutiŋich ittut kiḷḷiġruanilġiñaqtuatun uviñik nuŋuuqtuaqługu. Malġuk tainnatchik iññuk iḷisaurrik Hymenaeus-lu Philetus-lu. 
6806, Remind people of these things and solemnly charge them before the Lord not to wrangle over words. This is of no benefit; it just brings ruin on those who listen. ,"Taapkuak iññuk ukpiġiŋaiŋagaak iḷumun ittuaq, aasii ukpiqtuat iḷaŋich ukpiġutaiqsiłługich, iḷumun inŋitchuamik iḷisaurrivḷutik aŋŋisikput qaaŋianignivḷugu. "
6807," Make every effort to present yourself before God as a proven worker who does not need to be ashamed, teaching the message of truth accurately. ","Aglaan God-im iḷumun ittuaŋa allaŋŋulaitchuq, iłłuni aulayaitchuatun maŋŋuliutitun aulayyaŋnaġumiñaitchuatun. Aasii ukua malġuich uqaluich God-im aglaaŋi aglagivlugich, “Atanġum iḷisimagai ilaan iñuŋni,” suli, “Kiñaliqaa Atanġum iñugikkaŋa piḷuusiqiugaŋaiġḷi.”"
6808," But avoid profane chatter, because those occupied with it will stray further and further into ungodliness, ","Suġalliruam igluqpakpaŋani qanusiḷimaat utkusiich pugguttallu ittut. Tamatkua utkutchiagurut puggutchiagurullu iḷaŋich maniŋñiñ qatiqtuaniñ suli iḷaŋich kaviqsuaniñ maniŋñiñ, iḷaŋitchauq qiruŋniñ suli iḷaŋich qikumiñ.

6809, and their message will spread its infection like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are in this group. ,"Tainnatulli ilivsi qanupayaaq piḷuusiqilaitkuvsi inniaqtusi akisuruatun utkusiksun puggutatullu ilaaguaqtauruatun atugaksrauvlugu kisianun Christ pitqukkaŋanun, itqanaitchuatun atuggaksrauvluni qanusipayaamun savaaġiksuamun. "
6810," They have strayed from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already occurred, and they are undermining some people’s faith. ","Tavra kamaginagich pigiitchuat pisuguutiŋi nutaġaunġum, aglaan sivuniqaġlutin iłuaqtualiqiniġmik ukpiġunmik, piviuttaqqunmik, tutqiunmiglu, piqatigilugich tamatkua piḷuutaitchuakun ququularuat Ataniġmun ikayuquvlutiŋ. "
6811," However, God’s solid foundation remains standing, bearing this seal: “The Lord knows those who are his,” and “Everyone who confesses the name of the Lord must turn away from evil.”","Iḷaksianagich naluvlutiŋ isumalluaġiirrutikun qapiqtaiḷisuuruat, iḷisimarutin isagutipkaġuugaich qanaaġutit. "
6812," Now in a wealthy home there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also ones made of wood and of clay, and some are for honorable use, but others for ignoble use. ","Atanġum kivgaŋa qanaayuktuksrauŋitchuq, suli piaqłuktautaitchuksrauruq iñupayaamun, nakuuluni qimmaksaliyaiḷḷuniḷu iḷisaurriḷuni "
6813," So if someone cleanses himself of such behavior, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart, useful for the Master, prepared for every good work. ","natqiksruġlugich pikałaktautairrutikun akiḷḷiḷiqsuutiruat God-mun, iḷaanni God-im isumalitqiksitaupkaqpiaġai suli iḷitchuġipkaġlugich iḷumun ittuamik. "
6814," But keep away from youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace, in company with others who call on the Lord from a pure heart. ",Aasii qauriruatun piñiaqtut annakkumiñaqsiḷutiŋ nigatchiaŋaniñ Tuunġaum kamaksripkaiyugaŋaruam iliŋiññik pisuunmiñik.
6815," But reject foolish and ignorant controversies, because you know they breed infighting. ",
6816," And the Lord’s slave must not engage in heated disputes but be kind toward all, an apt teacher, patient, ",
6817, correcting opponents with gentleness. Perhaps God will grant them repentance and then knowledge of the truth ,
6818, and they will come to their senses and escape the devil’s trap where they are held captive to do his will.,
6819," But understand this, that in the last days difficult times will come. ","Aglaan kaŋiqsisiuŋ una, siġḷiġniuġutit iḷiñiaqtut aqulliġñi uvluni. "
6820," For people will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, ","Qanuq iñuich siŋñatusiñiaqtut piḷḷatusiḷutiŋ, kamasaaliġḷutiŋ, uqavigaaliġḷutiŋ, uqamaqłuurriḷiġḷutiŋ kamaksriḷḷaiġḷutiŋ aŋayuqaamiŋnik, quyyataiġḷutiŋ, pigiitchualiqilutiglu, "

6822," treacherous, reckless, conceited, loving pleasure rather than loving God. ","Aitchuutiginnigniaqtut iḷauraamiŋnik, isumamiŋni sivunmuusuusiḷutiŋ, kamasaalipiaġataġlutiŋ, piviuttaġiłhaaliġḷugu aliasuŋisaaġun piviuttaqsriñiġmiñ God-mik. "
6823, They will maintain the outward appearance of religion but will have repudiated its power. So avoid people like these. ,"Piraġausiġiniaġaluaġaich qanusipayaat aŋaiyyuliqinikun piraġausiuruat, God-im suaŋŋataanun allaŋŋuqtinniaġnagich iñuutchisiŋ. Piqataunak tainnatchiñun iñuŋnun. "
6824, For some of these insinuate themselves into households and captivate weak women who are overwhelmed with sins and led along by various passions. ,"Iñuich iḷaŋich tainnatchit pitqiksuat isiġuurut aimaaġviŋiññun iñuich aasii payarivḷugich piyaruat aġnat tutqiutaiḷḷuqtuat piḷuutitiŋ pisigivlugich, aŋalatiłłutiŋ qanusipayaanun god-taiḷaġnikun kipiġniuġutinun, "

6826," And just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these people – who have warped minds and are disqualified in the faith – also oppose the truth. ","Jannes-tullu Jambres-tullu akiḷḷiḷiqsuiŋaruaktun Moses-mik, tainnatuttauq tamatkua iḷisaurriŋŋuat akiḷḷiḷiqsuġmigaat God-im iḷumun ittuaŋa, iñuich isumaqaqtuat pigiitchuanik ukpiġutiŋŋuamiglu. "
6827," But they will not go much further, for their foolishness will be obvious to everyone, just like it was with Jannes and Jambres.","Aglaan ayuupiaġumiñaitchut, qanuq iñupayaat iḷitchuġiniaġaich isumalluaġiirrutiŋich nalunaiqpata taipkuŋnatuttauq Jannes-tullu Jambres-tullu."
6828," You, however, have followed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, ","Aglaan ilivich maliġuaŋagiñ iḷisaurrutiga, aullasiġalu, sivuniġalu iñuggunmi, ukpiġutigalu, qiñuirrutigalu, piviuttaqqutigalu, tuniqsimmatigalu, "
6829," as well as the persecutions and sufferings that happened to me in Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra. I endured these persecutions and the Lord delivered me from them all.

6840," The reason I left you in Crete was to set in order the remaining matters and to appoint elders in every town, as I directed you. ","Qimaŋagikpiñ Crete-mun, iłuaqsruquvlugich sut iłuaqsrugaksrauruat taamani, suli nalunaiqsitquvlusi umialiŋnanik nunaaqqipayaani. Itqaumalugich iḷisaurrutitka. "

6842," For the overseer must be blameless as one entrusted with God’s work, not arrogant, not prone to anger, not a drunkard, not violent, not greedy for gain. ","Qanuq umialiŋnaq qaunaksrauruq God-mun savaanik, pasiñaqtuksrauŋitchuq.

6844," He must hold firmly to the faithful message as it has been taught, so that he will be able to give exhortation in such healthy teaching and correct those who speak against it.","Umialiŋnam ukpiġipiagaksraġigai nayummatauluniḷu God-im iḷumun ittuat uqaluŋi iḷisausiaġiŋarani, iḷisaurriyumiñaġugluni allaniktauq iñuŋnik suli iḷisautilugich killukuaqtilaaŋannik tamatkua akiḷḷiḷiqsuisaaruat inmiñik."
6845," For there are many rebellious people, idle talkers, and deceivers, especially those with Jewish connections, ","Qanuq iñugiaktut kamasuutaitchuat iñuich sagluqinniktuallu taŋiġiḷanik uqaqłutiŋ, tamatkuałhaaq iḷisaurriruat nalunaiñŋutchiqsuksrauvlugu iñuk annaurrauniaqpan. "
6846, who must be silenced because they mislead whole families by teaching for dishonest gain what ought not to be taught. ,"Tainna uqaŋaiqsitaksraurut, qanuq maqutchirut tamatkiqł̣ugich qitunġaġiiñik iḷisaurrivḷutiŋ iḷisaurrutiksraġiŋisamiŋnik kanŋunaqtuakun sivuniġivlugu maniññaŋniaġniq. "
6847," A certain one of them, in fact, one of their own prophets, said, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons.” ","Iḷaŋat iliŋisa Cretan-miut nalautchaqtaat uqallaŋaruq, “Cretans ataramik saglusuurut, niġrułłuktun ittut, iqiasuuvlutiŋ niġġiqsunialgiñmiut.” "
6848, Such testimony is true. For this reason rebuke them sharply that they may be healthy in the faith ,"Taamna iḷaŋata uqallautaa iḷumun ittuq. Taamna pisigilugu suapiaġatakkich, nalaunŋasiyumaut ukpiġunmiŋni, "
6849, and not pay attention to Jewish myths and commands of people who reject the truth. ,"ukpiġiŋaiġḷugich Jew-guruat taŋiġiḷat unipkaaŋich, kamagiŋaiġḷugiḷḷu iñugruiññaich pitquraliaŋich ayyairuat iḷumun ittuamik. "
6850," All is pure to those who are pure. But to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and consciences are corrupted. ","Niqipayaurat piraġautchiḷḷu salumarut, akuqtuġnaġumiñaqtullu ukpiqtuaguruanun isummasiqaqtuanun nalaunŋaruamik God-itun, aglaalli sumik salumaruagitchuq tamatkunuŋa piḷuusiqirauruanun ukpiŋaitchuanullu, qanuq isumaqaġviŋich isumaŋiḷḷu salumaitchut piḷuktuaguvlutiŋ. "
6851," They profess to know God but with their deeds they deny him, since they are detestable, disobedient, and unfit for any good deed.","Iḷisimanigaluaġaat God, aglaan iñuuniaġusimiŋni naluruatun itkaat, naġġunapiaġataqtut kamasulaitchullu, nalliummatiŋitchut qanusipayaamun nakuuruamun."
6852," But as for you, communicate the behavior that goes with sound teaching. ","Aglaalli ilivich, iḷisaurriiñ nalaunŋaruamik iḷisaurrunmik. "
6853," Older men are to be temperate, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in endurance. ","Iḷisautikkich utuqqanaaġuqtuat aŋutit qaaŋiulaaŋasitquŋiḷḷugich, kinnaksaqtuagutquŋiḷḷugich, inmiŋnik aŋalalluataqulugich, nalaunŋaruamik ukpiġutiqaġlutiŋ, piviuttaqqutiqaġlutiglu, suli nikatchaŋiḷḷutiŋ. "
6854," Older women likewise are to exhibit behavior fitting for those who are holy, not slandering, not slaves to excessive drinking, but teaching what is good. ","Tainnatun suli utuqqanaaġuqtuat aġnat iḷisautikkich iñuusiqaqulugich piḷuutaitchuanik, tiġliraqłiŋaiġḷutiŋ imiŋasiraġaŋaiġḷutiglu. Iḷisaurrutigiraksraġigaich sut nakuuruat, "
6855," In this way they will train the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children, ","ayuġaksautigilugich niviaqsianun piviuttaġitqulugich uiŋich miqłiqtuŋiḷḷu, "
6856," to be self-controlled, pure, fulfilling their duties at home, kind, being subject to their own husbands, so that the message of God may not be discredited.

6857," Encourage younger men likewise to be self-controlled, ",Tainnatuttauq kiaqsrukkich nukatpiat inmiŋnik aŋalalluataqulugich. 
6858," showing yourself to be an example of good works in every way. In your teaching show integrity, dignity, ",Iliviḷḷiasii qanusipayaatigun savaaġiksuatigun tuvraaksriiruksraurutin. Iḷisaurriguvich pimmaġiksaapiaġlutin. 
6859," and a sound message that cannot be criticized, so that any opponent will be at a loss, because he has nothing evil to say about us. ","Uqaluqaġlutin naġġuksruġnaġumiñaitchuamik, akiḷḷiḷiqsuqtitin kanŋutchaktitauyumaut, sumik pigiitchuamik uqaksraiḷḷutiŋ uvaptigun."
6860," Slaves are to be subject to their own masters in everything, to do what is wanted and not talk back, ","Iḷisautikkich kivgat kamagitqulugich ataniŋich suli iviġagniaqulugich supayaatigun. Kiummatiqaqtuksrauŋitchut ataniġmiŋnun, "

6862," For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people. ",Qanuq God-im annaurrisaa nagliktuutiqpaŋmigun iḷisimanaqsiŋaruq iñupayaanun. 
6863," It trains us to reject godless ways and worldly desires and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, ","Aasii taavrumuuna nagliktuutiqpaŋmigun ilaan iḷisautigaatigut iñuusiqaŋaiquvluta god-aiḷaġluta kipiġniuġutigiŋaiġḷugiḷḷu pigiitchuat, aglaan iñuutquvluta aŋalalluataġluta uvaptiŋnun, nalaunŋaruakullu god-iliqiruaguluta mattumani iñuutchimi, "
6864," as we wait for the happy fulfillment of our hope in the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ. ",utaqqiŋŋapta niġiugivlugu quvianaqtuaq uvluq tikitchumaaqtuaq tautugviksrautikput qaumanġanik kamanaqtuam God-ipta Annaurriptalu Jesus Christ. 
6865," He gave himself for us to set us free from every kind of lawlessness and to purify for himself a people who are truly his, who are eager to do good. ","Tuquvluni aitchuutigiŋaruq inmiñik uvaptiŋnun atanniqsimaŋaiqsitchaqłuta iluqaanun pigiitchuamun, ilaaguaqsaqłuta ilaan iñugisukłuta, kipiġniuqtuaguut nakuurualiqisukłuta. "
6866, So communicate these things with the sort of exhortation or rebuke that carries full authority. Don’t let anyone look down on you.,"Iḷisautigikkich tamatkua, atuġlugu iluqaan ataniġnaqutin. Qapiŋaisaakkich suaglugiḷḷu naalaġniruat iliŋnik. Kialiqaa suuŋiḷaġiŋaiḷḷisin."
6867," After God spoke long ago in various portions and in various ways to our ancestors through the prophets, ","Qaŋapak taimani God uqaġuuŋaruq maŋŋuuptiŋnun uqaqłuni uqaqtimigun iñugiaktuatigun allakaaġiiksuatigullu piḷġutchisigun, "
6868," in these last days he has spoken to us in a son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he created the world. ","aglaan makkunani aqulliġñi uvluni ilaan uqautiŋagaatigut uqaqłuni Iġñiġmigun, nalunaiqsamigun kiŋuvaannaquvlugu supayaanik, ilaan piqatigivlugu Iġñiq savaŋavlugich supayaurat. "
6869," The Son is the radiance of his glory and the representation of his essence, and he sustains all things by his powerful word, and so when he had accomplished cleansing for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high. ","Iġñiġum salapqiŋagaa God-im kamanautaa, salapqiqł̣ugulu God-im qanuqitilaaŋa, nayummivḷugu sunapayaaq uqaluŋmigun suaŋaruakun. Ilaa salummautauganikami piḷuutiptiŋnun, aquvinŋaruq taliqpiata tuŋaanun God-im kamanaqtuam qiḷaŋmi."
6870, Thus he became so far better than the angels as he has inherited a name superior to theirs.,Tavra kamanaqsił̣haaŋaruq isaġuliŋniñ suli God-im atchiŋagaa kamanałhaaqtuamik atiġmik ilaisa atiŋiññiñ. 
6871," For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my son! Today I have fathered you”? And in another place he says, “I will be his father and he will be my son.” ",Qaŋaunnii God uqallaŋaitchuq inna isaġuliŋmun.
6872," But when he again brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all the angels of God worship him!” ",
6873," And he says of the angels, “He makes his angels spirits and his ministers a flame of fire,” ",
6874," but of the Son he says,",
6875,"“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever,",
6876,and a righteous scepter is the scepter of your kingdom. ,
6877, You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness.,
6878,"So God, your God, has anointed you over your companions with the oil of rejoicing.” ",
6879," And, ",
6880,"“You founded the earth in the beginning, Lord, ",
6881,and the heavens are the works of your hands. ,
6882," They will perish, but you continue. ",
6883,"And they will all grow old like a garment, ",
6884, and like a robe you will fold them up,
6885,"and like a garment they will be changed, ",
6886,but you are the same and your years will never run out.”,
6887," But to which of the angels has he ever said, “Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”? ",
6888," Are they not all ministering spirits, sent out to serve those who will inherit salvation?",
6889," Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away. ",Tavra tamatkua ukpiġiŋakkavut naalaġnimmaġiksaapiagaksraġigivut taapkunaŋŋa tusaagayukkaptiŋniñ asiñuurrauŋitchumaugut. 
6890," For if the message spoken through angels proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty, ","Tavra isaġulgich uqallautaat taŋŋiqsaullaruq, qanuq tamatkua kamaksriŋitchuat pitquranik tatavsaqtausuurut nalliummatiruamik. "
6891," how will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him, ","Qanuġluta uvagut annakkumiñaipiaqtugut ukpiġiŋisuaġuptigu kamanaqtigiruaq qanutun annaun. Taamna annaun uqautigiqqaaŋagaa Atanġum, aasii tamatkua tusaaruat qaaŋiqsinŋagaat nalupqinaiqł̣ugu uvaptiŋnun. "
6892, while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. ,"Suli God-im nalupqinaiġmivḷugu aliuġnaqtuatigun, allakaaġiisigullu kamanaqtualiqiatigun, Ilitqusiġiksuamiglu God-im aitchuutaanik uvaptiŋnun ikayuqtiksraptiŋnik piḷḷuataqtilluta God-im savaaġitqukkaŋiñik."
6893," For he did not put the world to come, about which we are speaking, under the control of angels. ",God-im isaġuliŋnun aitchuutigiŋaitkaa nuna qaiyumaaqtuaq uqautigikkaqput aŋalataġitqulugu. 
6894, Instead someone testified somewhere: ,"Uqaluktuaguŋammiuq imma sumi,"
6895,“What is man that you think of him or the son of man that you care for him?,"Qanuq taamna ilaaguaqsiruaġlu God-mun tamatkualu ilaaguaqtauruat God-mun iluqaġmiŋ atautchimiñ Aapamiñ maŋŋuqaqtut. Taamna pisigivlugu Jesus kanŋugiŋitkaa taigumigich aniqatinik, "
6896, You made him lower than the angels for a little while. ,"uqaqłuni, “God quliaqtuaġiniaġiga atqiñ aniqatiimnun, akunġanni aŋaiyyuliqiruat nanġaġniaġikpiñ.” "
6897,You crowned him with glory and honor.,"Suli Jesus uqallavsaaŋaruq, “God-mun ukpiġniaqtuŋa.” Uqallavsaaġmivḷunisuli, “Uvaniittuŋa piqatigivlugich miqłiqtut God-im aitchuutiŋi uvamnun.”"
6898, You put all things under his control.”,"Miqłiqtutaasii atunim timiqaġmata, ilaaptauq tainnatun timiniŋaruq, tuqqutikun suksraunġiġukługu Tuunġaq tuqupkaiḷḷaruaq iñuŋnik. "
6899,"For when he put all things under his control, he left nothing outside of his control. At present we do not yet see all things under his control, ",Suli Jesus tuquŋaruq iñuich sivuuġaruat tuqqunmik sivuuġaŋaiquvlugich tavraŋŋaaglaan. 
6900," but we see Jesus, who was made lower than the angels for a little while, now crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by God’s grace he would experience death on behalf of everyone. ","Qanuq nalupqinaitchuq, isumaaluuttaqaŋitchuq isaġuliŋnik, aglaan kiŋuniiŋiñik Abraham. "
6901," For it was fitting for him, for whom and through whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, to make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through sufferings. ","Taamna pisigivlugu Jesus timiqaqtuksrauŋaruq aniqatiimisun, nagliksrauluni piḷḷuatautikullu aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun qaukłiutquvlugu savaurriñiġmi God-mik, naamaruamik akiḷiitquvlugu piḷuutiŋisigun iñuich. "
6902," For indeed he who makes holy and those being made holy all have the same origin, and so he is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters, ","Aasii ilaan ikayuġumiñaġai tamatkua piḷuksipkaġniaqtauruat, ilaaptauq nagliksaaŋavluni piḷuksipkaqtauniaġnikun."
6903," saying, “I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will praise you.” ",
6904," Again he says, “I will be confident in him,” and again, “Here I am, with the children God has given me.” ",
6905," Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he likewise shared in their humanity, so that through death he could destroy the one who holds the power of death (that is, the devil), ",
6906, and set free those who were held in slavery all their lives by their fear of death. ,
6907," For surely his concern is not for angels, but he is concerned for Abraham’s descendants. ",
6908," Therefore he had to be made like his brothers and sisters in every respect, so that he could become a merciful and faithful high priest in things relating to God, to make atonement for the sins of the people. ",
6909," For since he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.",
6910," Therefore, holy brothers and sisters, partners in a heavenly calling, take note of Jesus, the apostle and high priest whom we confess, ","Tavraasii, aniqatitkaa, ilaaguaqtauvlusi God-mun, piqatauruasii iluqasi ququakkaŋasii God-im qiḷaŋmiittuam, isumalaaġutigisiuŋ Jesus God-im tiliŋakkaŋa aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun qaukłiuruaq ukpiġikkaptiŋnun. "
6911," who is faithful to the one who appointed him, as Moses was also in God’s house. ","Ilaan piḷḷuatautiŋagaa God piksraqtaaġirini, Moses-tuttauq piḷḷuatautiqaŋaruatun God-im igluani. "
6912," For he has come to deserve greater glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house deserves greater honor than the house itself! ","Naaggauvva God uqallaŋaruq Jesus nanġausiaqałhaaqtuksraunivḷugu Moses-miñ, igluqpiruaqtauq nanġausiaqałhaaġmatun igluqpiamiñiñ. "
6913," For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God. ","Qanuq igluqpapayaaq iñuum nappaŋagaa, aglaalli God savaŋaruq supayaanik. "
6914," Now Moses was faithful in all God’s house as a servant, to testify to the things that would be spoken. ","Tavra Moses kivgalluatauŋaruq supayaatigun God-im igluani, kivgatun iłłuni, uqaqtuksrauvluni sunik taŋŋianiŋaitchuanik paŋmapak. "
6915," But Christ is faithful as a son over God’s house. We are of his house, if in fact we hold firmly to our confidence and the hope we take pride in.","Aglaan Christ iġñiġuvluni God-mun aŋalatchiḷḷuataŋaruq God-im igluanik. Aasiuvva uvagut igluqatigigaatigut, pigiuraġniaġuptigu ukpiqsimaaġniqput, quviagilugulu niġiuguraġniaġupta isuanun-aglaan."
6916," Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,","Tavraasii Ilitqusiġiksuaq uqallaŋaruq,"
6917,"“Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks!","Uqallautauŋamman Bible-ni,"
6918," “Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of testing in the wilderness.",
6919," “There your fathers tested me and tried me, and they saw my works for forty years.",
6920," “Therefore, I became provoked at that generation and said, ‘Their hearts are always wandering and they have not known my ways.’",
6921," “As I swore in my anger, ‘They will never enter my rest!’”",
6922," See to it, brothers and sisters, that none of you has an evil, unbelieving heart that forsakes the living God. ",
6923," But exhort one another each day, as long as it is called “Today,” that none of you may become hardened by sin’s deception. ",
6924," For we have become partners with Christ, if in fact we hold our initial confidence firm until the end. ",
6925," As it says, “Oh, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion.” ",
6926, For which ones heard and rebelled? Was it not all who came out of Egypt under Moses’ leadership? ,
6927," And against whom was God provoked for forty years? Was it not those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? ",
6928," And to whom did he swear they would never enter into his rest, except those who were disobedient? ",
6929, So we see that they could not enter because of unbelief.,
6930," Therefore we must be wary that, while the promise of entering his rest remains open, none of you may seem to have come short of it. ","Tavraasii, unniqsuqłiisaa itkaluaqtuq suli, isiġniksrakun ilaan unaŋuiqsiutaanun, anayasuktuaqta iḷaanni nalliqsi tikiñŋitpiaqtuq taavrumuŋa unaŋuiqsiġviŋmun. "
6931," For we had good news proclaimed to us just as they did. But the message they heard did them no good, since they did not join in with those who heard it in faith. ","Qanuq tusaayugaaġiksuat tikiutiŋammiut uvaptiŋnun tainnatupiaġataq ilaiññun tikiñmatun, aglaan tusaakkaŋata anniqsuŋaitkai, qanuq ukpiġiŋaitkaat. "
6932," For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, “As I swore in my anger, ‘They will never enter my rest!’” And yet God’s works were accomplished from the foundation of the world. ","Uvagut ukpiqtuaġuŋaruaguut isianiŋarugut unaŋuiqsiġviŋmun God-im aitchuutaanun ilaan uqallausiatun,"
6933," For he has spoken somewhere about the seventh day in this way: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works,” ","Tavra Joshua-m aullatiŋakpagich unaŋuiqsiunmun, God aquvatigun uqautiqaġayaitchuq allamik unaŋuiqsiġviksramik qakugukpan. "
6934, but to repeat the text cited earlier: “They will never enter my rest!” ,"Tainnainniġman aasii, imma ittuq Savaiññikun unaŋuiqsiġviksraŋat iñuŋisa God-im. "
6935," Therefore it remains for some to enter it, yet those to whom it was previously proclaimed did not enter because of disobedience. ","Qanuq kiñaliqaa isiqtuaq God-im unaŋuiqsiġvianun nutqaġmiuq savaamiñiñ, God-ituttauq nutqaġmatun savaamiñiñ. "
6936," So God again ordains a certain day, “Today,” speaking through David after so long a time, as in the words quoted before, “O, that today you would listen as he speaks! Do not harden your hearts.” ","Tavraasii isiġniḷupiaqta taavrumuŋa unaŋuiqsiġviŋmun, nalliqputunnii suksraunġiŋitchumauq tuvrautiluni tainnatchimun ukpiġutairrunmun. "
6937," For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken afterward about another day. ","Qanuq uqalua God-im taŋŋiġuupiaqtuq suaŋŋatiqaqtuġlu, avikługik iñuuvlu pisuutaa, God-ivlu pisuutaa, savikpaktun avanmun kiiñaliktun ipiktuatun avguiruatun navyaaniglu patiġniglu. Suli isivġiiruq iñuich isummatiŋiññik pisuutiŋiññiglu. "
6938, Consequently a Sabbath rest remains for the people of God. ,"Suli God-im sivuġaani qanusipayaaq uumaruaq iriqsimaŋitchuq, aglaan supayaat aŋmarut tallutaitchullu irraŋnun ilaan isivġiiyumaaqtuam uvaptiŋnik."
6939," For the one who enters God’s rest has also rested from his works, just as God did from his own works. ","Tavraasii kamanaqtuamik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannik piqaġniqapta mayuŋaruamik qiḷaŋmun, Jesus-mik Iġñiŋanik God-im, ukpiqsimaapiaġataqta tuniqsimaluta. "
6940," Thus we must make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by following the same pattern of disobedience. ","Qanuq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannik piqaqtugut isumaaluqataullaruamik suaŋairrutiptiŋni, uvaptiktun uuktuqtauŋaruamik qanusipayaatigun, piḷuksiŋaitchuqaglaan. "
6941," For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing even to the point of dividing soul from spirit, and joints from marrow; it is able to judge the desires and thoughts of the heart. ","Tavraasii nalupqisuŋiḷḷuta qalliḷaaqta God-mun, nagliktuutiqaqtuamun, nagliktuusiaqaġumaugut aitchuusiaqaġlutalu nagliktuutiqpakkun ikayuusiaksraptiŋnik ikayuqtiqaqtuksraġuġupta."
6942," And no creature is hidden from God, but everything is naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must render an account.",
6943," Therefore since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast to our confession. ",
6944," For we do not have a high priest incapable of sympathizing with our weaknesses, but one who has been tempted in every way just as we are, yet without sin. ",
6945, Therefore let us confidently approach the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace whenever we need help.,
6946," For every high priest is taken from among the people and appointed to represent them before God, to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. ","Qanuq iluqaġmiŋ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiŋich piksraqtaagurut akunġanniñ iñuich. Taapkua nalunaiqsausuurut pisitquvlugich iñuich God-im sivuġaani, qaitchitquvlugich aitchuutinik ikipkautiniglu piḷuutaiġutiksranik. "
6947," He is able to deal compassionately with those who are ignorant and erring, since he also is subject to weakness, ","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaum suaŋairrutiqaqłuni araktuallagai piaqłuktautaitchuakun kamaksriŋitchuat naluvlugich God-im pitquraŋiñik, sagluqirauvlutiglu. "
6948, and for this reason he is obligated to make sin offerings for himself as well as for the people. ,Taamnaasii pisigivlugu ilaa aitchuiruksraupiaqtuq ikipkautinik pisigilugiḷḷu piḷuutini pisigaluaġmiḷḷaisa iñuich. 
6949," And no one assumes this honor on his own initiative, but only when called to it by God, as in fact Aaron was. ","Kiñaliqaa aŋaiyyuliqsiqpagulaitchuq inmiñik, aglaan ilaa nalunaiqsiqaġaqtuq God-mik, Aaron-tuttauq nalunaiqsaŋatun."
6950," So also Christ did not glorify himself in becoming high priest, but the one who glorified him was God, who said to him, “You are my Son! Today I have fathered you,” ","Tainnatuttauq Christ kamanaqsiḷiŋaitchuq inmiñik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun qaukłiġuqsaġluni, aglaan nalunaiqsiqaŋaruq God-mik uqallaktuamik inmiñun,"
6951," as also in another place God says, “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” ","Aasii Melchizedek-kun uqautiksraukkaġaluaqtugut siġḷiġnaqtuanik sivunniuqsaaruni, aglaan ilivsi kaŋiqsiḷguitchusi. "
6952," During his earthly life Christ offered both requests and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to the one who was able to save him from death and he was heard because of his devotion. ","Uvva paŋmapak iḷisaurriġuġumiñaqsigaluaqłusi, iḷisaurriqaqtuksraurusi-suli iñuŋmik iḷisaurrivsaaqtuksramik ilivsiññik sivulliqsigun iḷisaurrutitigun God-im uqaluŋiñi. Taamna pisigivlugu immuktuqtuksraurusi miqłiqtutun, niqipiaguŋitchuamik. "
6953," Although he was a son, he learned obedience through the things he suffered. ",Qanuq kiñaliqaa iñuggutiqaqtuaq immuŋmik miqłiqtutun ittuq naluvlugu nalaunŋaruaq naagga nalaunŋaitchuaq. 
6954," And by being perfected in this way, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him, ","Aglaan niqipiaq sivuniqaqtuq agliŋaruanun, tamatkunuŋa iḷitchuġipkaqtitauŋaruanun sum nalaunŋatilaaŋanik piḷuktilaaŋaniglu."
6955, and he was designated by God as high priest in the order of Melchizedek.,
6956," On this topic we have much to say and it is difficult to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing. ",
6957," For though you should in fact be teachers by this time, you need someone to teach you the beginning elements of God’s utterances. You have gone back to needing milk, not solid food. ",
6958," For everyone who lives on milk is inexperienced in the message of righteousness, because he is an infant. ",
6959," But solid food is for the mature, whose perceptions are trained by practice to discern both good and evil.",
6960," Therefore we must progress beyond the elementary instructions about Christ and move on to maturity, not laying this foundation again: repentance from dead works and faith in God, ","Tavra uqautigiŋaiḷḷaglugich sivulliich siġḷiġnaitchuat iḷisaurrutit Christ-kun, aglisaiññaqta. Iḷisaurrigiññaŋaiġḷuta sivulliġñik iḷisaurrutinik kisiiññik ukuniŋa, isumalitqiunmik piḷġutchiñiñ tuqunaqtuaniñ, ukpiġunmiglu God-mun, "
6961," teaching about baptisms, laying on of hands, resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. ","iḷisaurrutinik paptaiġutikun, iḷiñiŋanniglu argaŋisa umialiŋnat iñuum niaquanun, aŋŋisaatigullu tuquŋaruat, isuitchuakullu isivġiġvikun. "
6962," And this is what we intend to do, if God permits. ",Aasii taamna sivunmuktuġniksraqput taŋŋiġñiaġikput God-im pipkaġumiñaqpagu. 
6963," For it is impossible in the case of those who have once been enlightened, tasted the heavenly gift, become partakers of the Holy Spirit, ","Qanuq iñuich kaŋiqsipkaqtauganikamiŋ, uuktuaganikamiŋ annaunmik aitchuusiaqaanikamiglu Ilitqusiġiksuamik, "
6964," tasted the good word of God and the miracles of the coming age, ","uuktuaganikamirruglu nakuutaa God-im uqaluan, suaŋŋataalu Atanġum salapqiġñiakkaŋa ukiuni qaiyumaaqtuani, "
6965," and then have committed apostasy, to renew them again to repentance, since they are crucifying the Son of God for themselves all over again and holding him up to contempt. ","taapkua uuktuaqqaaqługich, aquatigun tunutkumirruŋ Christ, qanuġlugich isumalitqiksitqigñaġumiñaitchut. Qanuq ilaisa kikiaktuutitqigmatun pigaat Iġñiŋa God-im, suli kipautigivlugu ilaan tuqqutaa."
6966, For the ground that has soaked up the rain that frequently falls on it and yields useful vegetation for those who tend it receives a blessing from God. ,"Iñuich ukpiqsimaaqtuat Christ-mun qaunakkusiaqaqtut nunatun qaunakkusiaqaqtuatun sialuŋman, aasii naurivḷuni niqiksranik tamatkunuŋa nunaliqiruanun. "
6967," But if it produces thorns and thistles, it is useless and about to be cursed; its fate is to be burned. ",Iñuiḷḷi tunutchiruat Christ-mik suksraunġiqsaurut nunatun sialuŋman unnii nauriruatun kakiḷḷaġnaqtuanik. Anniqsuutauŋitchut ikiraugiññaġniaqtut. 
6968," But in your case, dear friends, even though we speak like this, we are convinced of better things relating to salvation. ","Tainna uqaġaluaġuptaunnii, piviuttaġirauruasii, nalupqisuŋitchugut nunagiksuatun itilaavsiññik aasii annaurrauvlusi. "
6969," For God is not unjust so as to forget your work and the love you have demonstrated for his name, in having served and continuing to serve the saints. ","Qanuq God nalaunŋaruq. Naluruuraaġniaŋitkaa ikayuutiksi, piviuttaqqullu iḷisimanaqtitaqsi savautikavsigik ukpiqtuat ilaa pisigivlugu, piḷġusivsisun paŋmapak. "
6970," But we passionately want each of you to demonstrate the same eagerness for the fulfillment of your hope until the end, ",Suli tainnatun kipiġniuttaġigivsi atausiullaavlusi ikayuiñiapiaquvlusi. Taamna piguvsiuŋ iñuuniqtutilaavsisun nalupqiginiaŋitkiksi annautiksraqsi. 
6971," so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and perseverance inherit the promises.","Tavraasii iqiatchautinagu ikayuiñiq, aglaan taipkunatun ukpiġutiqaġlusi qiñuirrutiqaġlusiḷu, kiŋuvaannakkumausi God-im unniqsuqłiisiŋiñik."
6972," Now when God made his promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself, ","God-im unniqsuqłiikamiuŋ Abraham, unniqsuqłiiŋagaa inmiguaqługu, sumik kamanałhaaqtuamik piiḷḷuni inmiñiñ, "
6973," saying, “Surely I will bless you greatly and multiply your descendants abundantly.” ","uqaqłuni, “Nalupqinaitchuamik quviasaapiaġniaġikpiñ, iñugiaksipkaġlugiḷḷu kiŋuniqtin.” "
6974," And so by persevering, Abraham inherited the promise. ","Tavraasii Abraham, qiñuiqł̣uni utaqqiuqqaaqłuni, piññaktaaġiŋagaa God-im unniqsuqłiisaa. "
6975," For people swear by something greater than themselves, and the oath serves as a confirmation to end all dispute. ","Iñuiḷḷi iḷumutun unniqsuqłiisuurut nalupqinaiyausiqł̣utiŋ kamanałhaaqtuanik inmiŋniñ, aasii tainnaġmata arguanaiġaqtuq unniqsuqłiisaat avanmun. "
6976," In the same way God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to the heirs of the promise that his purpose was unchangeable, and so he intervened with an oath, ","Tavrali God-im ukpiġnaqsiḷiġuŋagaa unniqsuqłiisini kiŋuvaannagniaqtuanun allaŋŋulaisilaaŋa sivunniutini, arguanaiyaqługu unniqsuqłiiñmik. "
6977," so that we who have found refuge in him may find strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us through two unchangeable things, since it is impossible for God to lie. ","Taapkuŋnuuna malġukkun allaŋŋulaitchuakkun, unniqsuqłiisikullu nalupqinaiyautikullu, God arguanaiŋaruq sagluyumiñaisilaamiñik. Uvagulli annaksaŋaruaguut qamannirviŋmun God-mun piyumalaaġusiqł̣uta piññaktaaġiyumavlugu annaun aitchuutigisukkaŋa. "
6978," We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, sure and steadfast, which reaches inside behind the curtain, ","Kitchatun pauksimmatauruatun, tainnatulli pauksimmatigigikput kitchatun taamna annagumman ilitqusiptiŋnun. Taamna annagumman qiḷaŋmi pigigikput, qanuq Jesus ayuŋaruq sivuptiŋni pisivluta. Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaktun isiŋaruq amuŋatchianun talukiyaam inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamun God-mun. Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguqtuq tuvraqługu piḷġusia Melchizedek-gum isuitchuamun."
6979," where Jesus our forerunner entered on our behalf, since he became a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.",
6980," Now this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God, met Abraham as he was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him. ","Qanuq taavruma Melchizedek-gum, umialgata Salem, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋan sapiġñaġniqsrauruam God-im, paaŋagaa Abraham utiqtuaq tuquġaqqaaqługich umialgich. Aasii Melchizedek-gum aŋaiyyutiŋagaa piḷḷuatautiqaquvlugu. "
6981," To him also Abraham apportioned a tithe of everything. His name first means king of righteousness, then king of Salem, that is, king of peace. ","Aasii Abraham-gum aitchuŋagaa quliŋŋuġutiŋiññik supayaurat piġġaktaami akimakami. Melchizedek-gum atqa mumiŋñiŋagun sivuniqaqtuq Umialguruq Iłuaqtualiqiniġmun, aasiisuli umialgummiuq Salem-mun sivuniqaqtuamun Umialganun Aŋuyautairrutim. "
6982," Without father, without mother, without genealogy, he has neither beginning of days nor end of life but is like the son of God, and he remains a priest for all time. ","Aapaiñmiuq aakaitchuġlu maŋŋuitchuġlu aglausimaruanik, suli Bible uqaluŋisa quliaqtuaġiŋitkaat aniñiŋa tuquniŋalu. Tavraasii Melchizedek ittuq Iġñiŋatun God-im aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauvluni isuitchuamun."
6983," But see how great he must be, if Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of his plunder. ",Isumalaaġutigisiuŋ qanutun kamanaqtilaaŋa. Abraham kamanautikun maŋŋuuruam aitchullammagu quliŋŋuġutiŋiññik piġġaktaami akimakami. 
6984," And those of the sons of Levi who receive the priestly office have authorization according to the law to collect a tithe from the people, that is, from their fellow countrymen, although they too are descendants of Abraham. ","Aasiiḷi taipkua kiŋuniŋi Levi-m aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguqtitauŋaruat pitquraqaqtut tigusitquvlugich quliŋŋuġutinik iñuŋniñ, ilaisa aniqatiimiŋniñ, maŋŋuqaġaluaqtillugitchauq Abraham-miñ. "
6985, But Melchizedek who does not share their ancestry collected a tithe from Abraham and blessed the one who possessed the promise. ,"Aglaan taamna iñuk Melchizedek, maŋŋuqaqatigiŋisaŋatunnii, aitchuusiaqaŋaruq quliŋŋuġutinik Abraham-miñ. Aasii uqallaŋaruq Abraham-mun unniqsuqłiisiaqaqtuamun, God-im piḷḷuataqtitchumagaatin. "
6986," Now without dispute the inferior is blessed by the superior, ",Iñuk tainna uqallallaruaq kamanałhaaqtuq taavrumaŋŋa uqallausiqaqtuamiñ. Kialiqaa taamna qapiġumiñaitkaa. 
6987," and in one case tithes are received by mortal men, while in the other by him who is affirmed to be alive. ","Aasiisuli Levi-m kiŋuniŋisa aitchuusiaġisuugaich quliŋŋuġutit aasii tuquvlutiŋ. Aglaalli Melchizedek aitchuusiaqaŋaruq quliŋŋuġutinik, quliaqtuaġuŋaitchuaq tuquŋaniḷugu. "
6988," And it could be said that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid a tithe through Abraham. ","Iḷaanni iñuktauq uqallakkumiñaġugnaġmiuq inna. Levi-vsauq kiŋuniŋi aitchuusiaqaġuurut quliŋŋuġutinik, akiḷiiŋammiñiqsut quliŋŋuġutinik Melchizedek-mun. "
6989, For he was still in his ancestor Abraham’s loins when Melchizedek met him.,"Qanuq Abraham aitchuimman, aitchuimmatun piŋammiut aniŋaiñŋaġmiŋ unnii ilaan kiŋuniġivlugich."
6990," So if perfection had in fact been possible through the Levitical priesthood – for on that basis the people received the law – what further need would there have been for another priest to arise, said to be in the order of Melchizedek and not in Aaron’s order? ","Pitqurat iñuŋnun aitchuutauŋarut aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaummata Levi-m kiŋuniŋi. Tavra iñuich annaurraullakpata naamasiḷugu Levi-m kiŋuniŋigun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauruatigun Aaron-kun, piqaġugnaġniaŋitkaluaqtuq allamik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋmik Melchizedek-tun ittuamik. "
6991," For when the priesthood changes, a change in the law must come as well. ","Qanuq allaŋŋuqtuksraġuġman aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaqaġniq Levi-m kiŋuniŋiñik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaktun Melchizedek-tun ittuamik, tainnatuttauq allaŋŋuqtuksraupiaġuummiut pitqurat. "
6992," Yet the one these things are spoken about belongs to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever officiated at the altar. ","Qanuq Christ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaktun Melchizedek-tun kaŋiqaqtuq allamiñ Aaron-guŋitchuamiñ, savaaqaŋaitchuaniñ ikipkaiviŋmi. "
6993," For it is clear that our Lord is descended from Judah, yet Moses said nothing about priests in connection with that tribe. ","Nalupqinaitchuq Ataniqput maŋŋuqaqtuaguruq Judah-miñ, aasii taapkua maŋŋuġiich Moses uqallausiġiŋaitkai aŋaiyyuliqsiqpautqulugich."
6994," And this is even clearer if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek, ",Taamna nalupqinaivsaaŋaruq allasuli aŋaiyyuliqsiqpak Melchizedek-tun ittuaq salapqiġman. 
6995, who has become a priest not by a legal regulation about physical descent but by the power of an indestructible life. ,"Christ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguŋaruq, pisigivlugu iñuuniŋa isuitchuamun. Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguŋaitchuq maŋŋuqaġniḷugu Aaron-miñ pitqurat apiqsriaŋatiktun. "
6996, For here is the testimony about him: “You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek.” ,"Qanuq God-im uqallautiŋagaa Christ, “Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaurutin isuitchuamun tuvraqługu Melchizedek.” "
6997," On the one hand a former command is set aside because it is weak and useless, ","Sivulliich pitqurat sivuniqaqtuat Levi-m kiŋuniŋigun asivaqtaurut, pisigivlugu suaŋaiññiŋat anniqsuutauŋiññiŋallu annaurriḷaił̣ł̣utiŋ iñuŋnik, "
6998," for the law made nothing perfect. On the other hand a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God. ","qanuq taipkua pitqurat nalaunŋasipiaġatalaitkaat kiñapayaaq sivuġaani God-im. Aglaan Christ pisigilugu aŋaiyyuliqsiqpagikkaqput annagummatiqapiaqtugut, suli qalliḷaaġumiñaqtugut God-mun."
6999," And since this was not done without a sworn affirmation – for the others have become priests without a sworn affirmation, ",God unniqsuqłiipiaŋaruq Christ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauniaġnivḷugu isuitchuamun. 
7000," but Jesus did so with a sworn affirmation by the one who said to him, “The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, ‘You are a priest forever’” – ","Taipkua sivuani aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguqtuat aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguqtitausuurut unniqsuqłiisauŋitchuakun God-miñ, aglaan Christ aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaguqtitauŋaruq unniqsuqłiisimik inna,"
7001, accordingly Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant. ,"Sivulliich aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich iñugiaŋarut, tuqusuuvlutiŋ. Tuqqutim piiġuuŋagai savaaŋiññiñ. "
7002," And the others who became priests were numerous, because death prevented them from continuing in office, ","Aglaan Jesus aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauruq taimuŋa, qanuq ilaa iñuuruq isuitchuamun. "
7003, but he holds his priesthood permanently since he lives forever. ,"Tainnaiłłuniasii ilaan ataramik annautiyumiñaġai tamatkua qalliḷaaqtuat God-mun inmigun, qanuq iñuuruq ataramik qiññuaqtuutisukługich God-mun."
7004," So he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. ","Qanuq nalaunŋaruq tainnatchimik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannik piqaġupta, ilaaguaqtauruamik God-mun, pasiñaġumiñaitchuamik, piġuaġniġitchuamik, ilaaguaŋaruamik piḷuusiqiriniñ, kamanaqsipkaqtauruamik qiḷaŋmi. "
7005," For it is indeed fitting for us to have such a high priest: holy, innocent, undefiled, separate from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. ","Jesus taipkunatun inŋitchuq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiŋisitun, aitchuiruksrauluni ikipkautinik uvlutuaqpan, sivulliġilugich ilaan piḷuutini, piḷuutiŋiññullu iñuich. Qanuq tuqukami naanŋagai ikipkautit pitqigaksraiqł̣ugich, inmiñik aitchuutigivluni. "
7006," He has no need to do every day what those priests do, to offer sacrifices first for their own sins and then for the sins of the people, since he did this in offering himself once for all. ",Pitquratigun aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiksraġuugaich piḷuksiḷḷaruanik. Aasii pitqurat qaisauganiŋmata God-im nalunaiŋagaa Iġñini piḷuksiŋaitchuaq isuitchuamun.
7007," For the law appoints as high priests men subject to weakness, but the word of solemn affirmation that came after the law appoints a son made perfect forever.",
7008," Now the main point of what we are saying is this: We have such a high priest, one who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven, ","Tavra sivuniġikkaŋa uqaluutigikkapta innaittuq. Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiannik piqaqtugut Christ-mik, aquvititauruamik taliqpiata tuŋaanun God-im kamanaqtuam qiḷaŋmi. "
7009," a minister in the sanctuary and the true tabernacle that the Lord, not man, set up. ","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat pisinniktuq inimi ilaaguaqtauruami God-mun tupipiamiittuami aŋaiyyuviŋmi, iñuum nappaqtaġiŋisaŋani, aglaan Atanġum nappaqtaŋani."
7010, For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. So this one too had to have something to offer. ,Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat aitchuutiqaqtuksrausuumman piksraqtaaguruaq aitchuitquvlugu aitchuutinik ikipkautiniglu God-mun pisivlugich iñuich; tainnatulli aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat pigikkaqput aitchuutiksraqaqtuksraupiaġmiuq sumik. 
7011," Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest, since there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. ","Tavra Christ nunamiitkumi, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauyumiñaitkaluaqtuq sumikunnii, qanuq allanik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaqaqtuq nunami qaitchisuuruanik aitchuutinik pitquratiguaqłutiŋ. "
7012," The place where they serve is a sketch and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary, just as Moses was warned by God as he was about to complete the tabernacle. For he says, “See that you make everything according to the design shown to you on the mountain.” ","Savaktut tupiġmi tuvrautiruami taġġauruamiḷu qiḷaŋmiittuamun tupipiamun aŋaiyyuviŋmun. Qanuq Moses nappaisaġumaagaqsimman tupiġmik aŋaiyyuviksramik, iḷisautiŋagaa God-im uqallautivlugu, “Qaunagilutin savakkumagitin supayaat tuvraġlugu iḷiktiġusiaq iḷisaurrusiaġikkan iġġimi.” "
7013," But now Jesus has obtained a superior ministry, since the covenant that he mediates is also better and is enacted on better promises.","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich savaktut tupiġmi nunamiittuami taġġałhiñauruami, Christ-li pisinnikkumiñaqsiŋaruq qiḷaŋmi nakuułhaasugruktuamik nunami aŋaiyyuliqsiqpauruaniñ. Ilaan savaaŋa kamanałhaaqtuq aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich savaaŋiññiñ, qanuq God-im sivunniuġutaa nutauruaq ilaan qaaŋiqsitaŋa uvaptiŋnun nakuułhaaqtuamik unniqsuqłiisiqaqtuq."
7014," For if that first covenant had been faultless, no one would have looked for a second one. ","Qanuq sivulliuruaq sivunniuġun naamaŋakpan, simmausiġñiaŋitkaluaqtuq. "
7015," But showing its fault, God says to them,","Ataniq God iviġaumaiñŋaruq taipkunuŋa iñuŋnun, aasii uqallakłuni,"
7016,"“Look, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah.",
7017," “It will not be like the covenant that I made with their fathers, on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of Egypt, because they did not continue in my covenant and I had no regard for them, says the Lord.",
7018," “For this is the covenant that I will establish with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their minds and I will inscribe them on their hearts. And I will be their God and they will be my people.",
7019," “And there will be no need at all for each one to teach his countryman or each one to teach his brother saying, ‘Know the Lord,’ since they will all know me, from the least to the greatest.",
7020," “For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will remember no longer.”",
7021," When he speaks of a new covenant, he makes the first obsolete. Now what is growing obsolete and aging is about to disappear.",
7022," Now the first covenant, in fact, had regulations for worship and its earthly sanctuary. ",Tavra taamnaunnii sivulliq sivunniuġutaa God-im uqaluqaŋaruq qanuq piruksrautilaaŋannik tupiġmi aŋaiyyuviŋmi nunamiittuami. 
7023," For a tent was prepared, the outer one, which contained the lampstand, the table, and the presentation of the loaves; this is called the holy place. ","Qanuq tupiq nappaqtauŋaruq siḷalliġuaqaqługu tairauruamik ilaaguaqtamik inimik God-mun. Aasii iḷuaniinŋarut qulliqaġvigḷu, niġġiviiḷḷu, qaamiutaqaqtuat punniġnik ilaaguaqtauruanik God-mun. "
7024, And after the second curtain there was a tent called the holy of holies. ,"Aasii tupiq kaŋiḷḷiqaqtuq tunuani talukiyaam, tairauruamik Ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamik inimik God-mun. "
7025," It contained the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered entirely with gold. In this ark were the golden urn containing the manna, Aaron’s rod that budded, and the stone tablets of the covenant. ","Aasii iḷuaniinŋaruq ikipkaiviḷiaq tivraġiksautinun piḷiaq maniŋmiñ kaviqsuamiñ, kigiunniġlu itqaumman God-im sivunniuġutaanun, puuqaqtuaq iluqani maniŋmik kaviqsuamik. Taavruma kiguunniġum imaġivlugich utkusigḷu piḷiaq maniŋmiñ kaviqsuamiñ imalik maana-mik, ayauppiaŋalu Aaron akutuqpanillaruaq, pitqurallu aglaŋaruat saapaqayaaŋnun uyaqqaŋnun. "
7026, And above the ark were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Now is not the time to speak of these things in detail. ,Qaaŋaniinŋaruk matuam isaġullak qaummaġiksuak qulaŋiqsimavlugu nagliktuusiannagvik God-miñ. Taapkua paŋmapak uqautiginiaŋitkivut qanupiaq sivuniqaqtilaaŋat.
7027," So with these things prepared like this, the priests enter continually into the outer tent as they perform their duties. ","Tamatkua itqanaiganigataġmata tainna, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich ataramik uglaġaġniqsut siḷalliġmun tupiġmun, savaaġiugaqługich piraksrautitiŋ. "
7028," But only the high priest enters once a year into the inner tent, and not without blood that he offers for himself and for the sins of the people committed in ignorance. ","Aglaan iḷuanun kaŋiḷḷium aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat kisimi isiġuuniqsuq atausiaqsiññaqługu ukiuq, augutiligaaqłuni piḷuutaiġutiksramiñik iñuiḷḷu piḷuutiŋisa piiġutiksraŋannik. "
7029, The Holy Spirit is making clear that the way into the holy place had not yet appeared as long as the old tabernacle was standing. ,"Taavrumuuna Ilitqusiġiksuam kaŋiqsipkaŋagaatigut taamna apqun inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamun God-mun aŋmaŋaisilaaŋanik-suli iñuich piḷḷasiḷugich tavruŋa, siḷallium tupqum napaniqtutilaaŋatun. "
7030," This was a symbol for the time then present, when gifts and sacrifices were offered that could not perfect the conscience of the worshiper. ",Taamna siḷalliq tupiq qiñiġaaġimmatun itkaa paŋmapak piraġautchim. Qanuq aitchuutit ikipkautillu aitchuutaugayuktut naamaŋitchuat piḷuutaipiaġumiñaġlugich aŋaiyyurauruat. 
7031, They served only for matters of food and drink and various washings; they are external regulations imposed until the new order came.,Aglaan tamatkua piraġautchich aŋalatchirut aŋaiyyuliqiniġmi niqiłhiñaniglu imiłhiñamiglu qanusiḷimaaniglu aŋaiyyuliqinikun salummaksautinik timimun. Tamatkua qaałhiñakun piraġautchich piruksrausuurut tikitchiaġivlugu God-im nakuułhaaqtuaq sivunniuġutaa taŋŋiqsitaŋa Christ-mun.
7032," But now Christ has come as the high priest of the good things to come. He passed through the greater and more perfect tent not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, ","Tavra paŋmapak Christ qaiganiŋaruq, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat nakuuruanun sunun paŋmapak ittuanun. Tupiq aŋaiyyuvik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋnun qaukłiuvigikkaŋa tupquŋitchuq nunami iñuich savaaġilugu, aglaan kamanałhaaqtuaq nakuułhaaqtuaġlu tupiq qiḷaŋmiittuaq. "
7033," and he entered once for all into the most holy place not by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood, and so he himself secured eternal redemption. ","Aasii aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiatitun Christ isiŋaruq pitqigaksraiqł̣ugu inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtauŋaruamun God-mun, augutiqaqłuni auŋił̣aaŋiññik niġrutit ikipkautausuuruat, aglaan ilaan auŋmiñik. Aasii auŋmiñik annakkumiñaqsiŋagaatigut isuitchuamun. "
7034," For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity, ",Qanuq taimani iñuk piḷuksiruaq salummaqtaugayuktuq God-im sivuġaani qivsaliktaukami niġrutit ikipkautausuuruat auŋiññik. 
7035," how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God.","Taamna tainnainŋakpan, qanutułhaaq auŋata Christ salummaqtigivagich ilitqutchisi tuqunaqtuaniñ piḷġutchiñiñ savautiyumiñaqsivḷugu God iñuuruaq. Christ, Ilitqusia iñuuruaq isuitchuamun, aitchuutigiŋaruq inmiñik tuqukami akuqtuġnaġumiñaqłuni God-mun."
7036," And so he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance he has promised, since he died to set them free from the violations committed under the first covenant. ","Taamna pisigivlugu Christ atisipkaiñiaqtiġuŋaruq aitchuqłuta nutauruamik sivunniuġutaanik God-im, tamatkua ququaqtauruat aitchuusiaqaquvlugich isuitchuamik kiŋuvaaksramik God-im unniqsuqłiisaanik. Christ tuqukami tasuġumiñaqsiŋagai iñuich kamaksriŋitchuat God-im pitquraŋiñik sivulliġmi sivunniuġunmi. "
7037," For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be proven. ","Kiñaliqaa sivunniqpan aitchuutigisukługich suġauttani kiŋuvaannaktuksrautinun aasii tuquvluni, taavruma iñuum tuquniŋa nalupqinaigaksrauruq kiŋuvaannaktuksrautit suġauttannaŋaiñŋaisa. "
7038," For a will takes effect only at death, since it carries no force while the one who made it is alive. ",Qanuq iñuum sivunniuġutaa taŋŋiġumiñaqtuq tuquanikpan kisianik. Iñuuŋŋaan kialiqaa kiŋuvaannaktaaġiyumiñaitkai suġauttaŋi. 
7039, So even the first covenant was inaugurated with blood. ,Taimñaunnii sivulliq sivunniuġun nalupqinaiqsauŋaruq auŋich niġrutit atuqługich. 
7040," For when Moses had spoken every command to all the people according to the law, he took the blood of calves and goats with water and scarlet wool and hyssop and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, ","Qanuq Moses uqautigianiŋmagich pitqurapayaurat sivunniuġunmiittuat iluqaiññun iñuŋnun, ilaa tigusiŋaruq auŋiññik niġrutit ikipkautausuuruat, imiġmiglu, kavviġiksuamiglu imnaim mitquanik, piġuaqtiġunmiglu aasii qivsaliŋagai auŋmik makpiġaat, iluqaisalu iñuich, "
7041," and said, “This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded you to keep.” ","aasii Moses uqaŋaruq, “Uuma augum nalupqinaiġaa sivunniuġutaa God-im ilivsiññun.” "
7042, And both the tabernacle and all the utensils of worship he likewise sprinkled with blood. ,Tainnatun suli ilaan qivsalgutigiŋagaa auk tupiġmullu aŋaiyyuviŋmun utkusipayaanullu allallu supayaurat atuġuukkaŋi aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaum aŋaiyyuniġmi. 
7043," Indeed according to the law almost everything was purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. ","Tavrakii kamagivlugich pitqurat, iluqakavsaŋmi sunapayaaq ilaaguaġutiqaġaqtuq God-mun auŋmik, suli auk maqinŋaunnagu, God-im piḷuutit suliqutigiŋaiḷaitkai itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich."
7044," So it was necessary for the sketches of the things in heaven to be purified with these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves required better sacrifices than these. ","Tavra tainnatun nunamiittuat sut aŋaiyyuliqiniġmi ilaaguagaksrausuuŋarut God-mun, niġrutim auŋanik piqutiqaġluni tuvrautiłhiñat qiḷaŋmiittuanun. Aglaan qiḷaŋmiittuat ilaaguagaksrauŋarut auŋanik Christ nakuułhaaqtuamik aitchuunmik tamatkunaŋŋa. "
7045," For Christ did not enter a sanctuary made with hands – the representation of the true sanctuary – but into heaven itself, and he appears now in God’s presence for us. ","Qanuq Christ isianiŋaruq qiḷaŋmun sivuġaanun God-im uvagut pisivluta. Isiŋaitchuq inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamun savaaŋannun iñuich, tuvrautiłhiñauruamun qiḷaŋmiittuamun. "
7046," And he did not enter to offer himself again and again, the way the high priest enters the sanctuary year after year with blood that is not his own, ","Naaggaunnii Christ aitchuutigitqigaġluni inmiñik piŋitchuq, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiŋisun inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamun ukiutuaġman isiġuuruatun saagaqłuni auŋmik, ilaan augiŋisamiñik. "
7047, for then he would have had to suffer again and again since the foundation of the world. But now he has appeared once for all at the consummation of the ages to put away sin by his sacrifice. ,"Qanuq tainna Christ aitchuutigitqigaaġuugumi, nagliksaatqigaqtuksrauniaġaluaqtuq akulaitchuami nunaqaŋa savaagumman. Aglaan paŋmapak, isuani piviksram, Christ qaiŋaruq atausiaqłuni, piiġiaqługu piḷuun aitchuutigivluni inmiñik. "
7048," And just as people are appointed to die once, and then to face judgment, ","Iñuich tuquruksrausuurut atautchimi, aasii taavruma aquagun isivġiqsaulutiŋ. "
7049," so also, after Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many, to those who eagerly await him he will appear a second time, not to bear sin but to bring salvation.","Tainnatulli Christ, tuqutauganiŋavluni atausiaqłuni piiġiaqługich piḷuutiŋich iñugiaktuat, niptatqigñiaġmiuq, piḷuun piiġiasuŋaġnagu aglaan annautiyaqtuġlugich niġiupiaqtuat inmiñik."
7050," For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore completely unable, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to perfect those who come to worship. ",Tavra pitqurat taġġauruatun isiññaŋarut sunun anniqsuutauyumaaqtuanun Christ qaġġisiniakkaŋiñun. Pitqurat aitchuiḷaiñŋarut tamatkuniŋa anniqsuusiaksranik. Taamna tainnainman pitqurat piḷuutaiqsiḷaiñŋarut tamatkuniŋa qalliḷaaqtuanik God-mun tamatkunuuna ikipkautitigun aitchuutausuuruatigun ukiutuaġman. 
7051," For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have no further consciousness of sin? ","Ikipkautit piḷuutaiqsiḷḷapiaqpata aġiunayaqtut pitqigaŋaiġḷugich. Aŋaiyyurauruat atausiaġlugu taimuŋa piḷuutaiqsaullakpata, tavraŋŋaaglaan itqatqikkayaitkaich piḷuutit. "
7052, But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. ,Tavraaglaan tamatkua ikipkaisit aitchuutauruat ukiutuaġman itqaqtirrutauraqtut piḷuusiqirautilaaŋannun iñuich. 
7053, For the blood of bulls and goats cannot take away sins. ,Qanuq auŋich ikipkautausuuruat niġrutit piḷuutaiġutauyumiñaitchut.
7054," So when he came into the world, he said,","Tainnainniġmata, Christ nunamukami, ilaa uqallaŋaruq God-mun,"
7055,"“Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.","Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpapayaaq nunamiittuaq makitasuuruq uvlutuaġman savaaġiramiñi, aitchuigaluamiiqł̣uni taapkuniŋasuŋaiññaq ikipkautinik, piḷuutaiġutauyumiñaitchuanik. "
7056, “Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in.,"Tavrali Christ aitchuiganikami ikipkaunmik piḷuutinun atautchimi taimuŋa, ilaa aquvinŋaruq God-im taliqpiata tuŋaanun, "
7057," “Then I said, ‘Here I am: I have come – it is written of me in the scroll of the book – to do your will, O God.’”",tavrani utaqqisaqłuni akiiḷitchiaġilugich uumigirini. 
7058," When he says above, “Sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you did not desire nor did you take delight in them” (which are offered according to the law), ",Qanuq atausiaqsiññaqłuni aitchuivḷuni ilaan piḷuutaiŋagai taimuŋa tamatkua ilaaguaqtauruat God-mun.
7059," then he says, “Here I am: I have come to do your will.” He does away with the first to establish the second. ","Taamna Ilitqusiġiksuam nalupqinaiŋagaa uvaptiŋnun, uqallakłuni inna,"
7060, By his will we have been made holy through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. ,"Tavraasii aniqatiit, attaqsrautairrutiqaqtugut isiġumiñaqłuta inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtauruamun God-mun auŋagun Jesus, "
7061, And every priest stands day after day serving and offering the same sacrifices again and again – sacrifices that can never take away sins. ,"ilaan aŋmautiŋagaatigut nutauruamik apqunmik qalliḷaaġviksraptiŋnik God-mun aasii iñuuluta isuitchuamun. Aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiatun qalliḷaaqtuatun God-mun amuŋatchianun talukiyaam, uvaguttauq qalliḷaaġumiñaġmigikput God timaagun Jesus, aitchuutigikkaŋagun tuquvluni. "
7062," But when this priest had offered one sacrifice for sins for all time, he sat down at the right hand of God, ",Suli kamanaqtuamik aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaqaqtugut atanġuruamik God-im igluqatiŋiñun. 
7063, where he is now waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet. ,"Taapkua tainnainniġmata, qalliḷaaqta God-mun iḷumutuuqtuamik uummatiqaġluta ukpiġutiqaġlutalu nalupqisuŋipiaqtuamik, isumaaluutaiġḷuta piḷuutiptiŋnik, suli salummaqtaupiaġluta piḷuutiptiŋniñ. "
7064, For by one offering he has perfected for all time those who are made holy. ,"Nalupqisuŋipiaqta qanuġliqaaŋaiġḷutalu uqautigiguptigu ukpiġikkaqput, qanuq God unniqsuqłiiŋaruaq ukpiġnapiaqtuq. "
7065," And the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us, for after saying, ",Suli isumalaaġutigilakput qanuġluta qapiŋaisaaġutisugluta avanmun piviuttaqqutiniġmun piḷġusiġiksuanullu. 
7066," “This is the covenant that I will establish with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws on their hearts and I will inscribe them on their minds,” ","Katitqataqta piŋitqataaŋaiġḷuta atautchimun, piḷġusiġiliutikkaŋatitun iḷaŋisa iñuich iḷisimalugu Atanġum uvlua qallisaiññaqtuaq."
7067," then he says, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no longer.” ","Qanuq piḷuusiqiugaaġupta pisaaġiugaġluta kaŋiqsiŋaqqaaġlugu iḷumun ittuaq, ikipkautiksravsaamik allamik piitchuq piḷuutiptiŋnun piiġutiksramik. "
7068," Now where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.","Aglaan imma ittuq sivuuġanaqtuaq niġiugiraksraqput isivġiqsauviksraun, suli suamaruaq igniq suksraunġiiñiaqtuaq uumigiriŋiññik God-im. "
7069," Therefore, brothers and sisters, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, ","Iñuk kamaksriŋitchuaq Moses pitquraŋiñik tuqutaugayuŋaruq nagligiriqayuitchuq, uqaġiriqaġman malġuŋnik piŋasuniglu iḷisimaruanik piḷuusiqimman. "
7070," by the fresh and living way that he inaugurated for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, ","Qanutun suaŋałhaaqtuamik tatavsagaksrauruq iñuk tununniktuaq God-im Iġñiŋanik, anniqsuutauŋiññivḷugu Christ tuqqutaa ilaan ilaaguaqtirrusiani God-mun, aasii pisaaŋavlugu Ilitqusiġiksuaq nagliktuutiqpaqaqtuaq inmiñun. "
7071," and since we have a great priest over the house of God, ","Qanuq iḷisimagikput kiutilaaŋa uqallaŋaruaq, “Nalaunŋaruamik uvaŋa piñiaqtuŋa. Uvaŋa akisaurriñiaqtuŋa.” Suli uqallavsaaŋaruq, “Uvaŋa Atanġuruaŋaa isivġiġñiaġitka iñutka.” "
7072," let us draw near with a sincere heart in the assurance that faith brings, because we have had our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed in pure water. ",Sivuuġanaqtuq tatavsaqtitchumiñaqsiruni God-mun iñuuruamun. 
7073," And let us hold unwaveringly to the hope that we confess, for the one who made the promise is trustworthy. ","Tavra itqaqsigik sivulliich taipkua uvluġiŋarasi ukpiqqaaqavsi, igḷutuŋagisi nagliksaaġutiqpaich akiiḷipkaġaluaġnasi. "
7074," And let us take thought of how to spur one another on to love and good works, ",Iḷaanniusi piaqłuktaqsiġuuŋarusi iłuiḷḷiuqtitausuurusiḷu iñuich takkuanni. Iḷaannisuli piqatausałhiñaaġuqłusi tainna aŋalatauruanun. 
7075," not abandoning our own meetings, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging each other, and even more so because you see the day drawing near.","Qanuq naglikkutiqaġuuŋarusiḷu tigutaaqtauruanun, suli sugilaitkiksi aqsaktauniq suġauttavsiññik, akuqtuqsimaaqługu suġaliqaqtilaaqsi nuŋuyumaaŋitchuanik qiḷaŋmi. "
7076," For if we deliberately keep on sinning after receiving the knowledge of the truth, no further sacrifice for sins is left for us, ","Taamna pisigilugu attaqsraŋirrutiqaġitchisuli Ataniġmun, kamanaqtuamik akiḷiusiaqaġniaqtusi. "
7077, but only a certain fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume God’s enemies. ,Aglaan manimmiḷgutiqaqtuksraurusi nalautchiyumiñaġuglusi pisuutaanik God-im aasii aitchuusiaqaġlusi ilaan unniqsuqłiisaanik iñuggunmik isuitchuamik. 
7078, Someone who rejected the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. ,"Qanuq Bible uqaluqaqtut inna,"
7079," How much greater punishment do you think that person deserves who has contempt for the Son of God, and profanes the blood of the covenant that made him holy, and insults the Spirit of grace? ",
7080," For we know the one who said, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.” ",
7081, It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God.,
7082, But remember the former days when you endured a harsh conflict of suffering after you were enlightened. ,
7083," At times you were publicly exposed to abuse and afflictions, and at other times you came to share with others who were treated in that way. ",
7084," For in fact you shared the sufferings of those in prison, and you accepted the confiscation of your belongings with joy, because you knew that you certainly had a better and lasting possession. ",
7085," So do not throw away your confidence, because it has great reward. ",
7086, For you need endurance in order to do God’s will and so receive what is promised. ,
7087, For just a little longer and he who is coming will arrive and not delay. ,
7088," But my righteous one will live by faith, and if he shrinks back, I take no pleasure in him. ",
7089," But we are not among those who shrink back and thus perish, but are among those who have faith and preserve their souls.",
7090," Now faith is being sure of what we hope for, being convinced of what we do not see. ",Iñuk ukpiġutiqaqtuaq nalupqisuŋitchuq God-im unniqsuqłiisiŋi taŋŋiġñiaqtilaaŋannik. Suli ukpiġutaata nalupqisuŋisitkaa sut ilitqutchikun ittuat iḷumun itilaaŋannik. 
7091, For by it the people of old received God’s commendation. ,"Qanuq taipkua iñuich taimani ukpiġutiqaġmata, God-im iviġaummatigiŋagai. "
7092," By faith we understand that the worlds were set in order at God’s command, so that the visible has its origin in the invisible. ","Ukpiġutiqaqłuta kaŋiqsigikput God-im uqaluŋmigun nunamik savaŋatilaaŋa, tamatkua sut tautugnaqtuat savaaguŋatilaaŋannik suniñ salapqiŋitchuaniñ."
7093," By faith Abel offered God a greater sacrifice than Cain, and through his faith he was commended as righteous, because God commended him for his offerings. And through his faith he still speaks, though he is dead. ","Abel ukpiġutiqaqłuni God-mun aitchuiŋaruq akuqtuġnałhaaqtuamik ikipkaunmik Cain-miñ, taavrumuuna ilaa iviġaumakkusiaqaŋaruq nalaunŋarualirauvluni. God-im nalunaiŋagaa iviġaumatilaani akuqtuqługich aitchuutiŋi. Abel tuquŋagaluaqtuq, ukpiġutaaniñ iḷitchiyumiñaqtugut suli. "
7094," By faith Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death, and he was not to be found because God took him up. For before his removal he had been commended as having pleased God. ","Enoch ukpiġutiqaqłuni mayuurrauŋaruq qiḷaŋmun tuqugaluaqtinnagu, aasii paqinnaiñŋaruq, qanuq God-im qiḷaŋmuutiŋagaa. Aasii mayuurrauŋaiñŋaan, God-im nalunaiŋagaa Enoch iviġaumagitilaaŋanik. "
7095," Now without faith it is impossible to please him, for the one who approaches God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him. ","Tavra kialiqaa ukpiġutaitchuam iviġagumiñaipiaġaa God. Qanuq kiñaliqaa qaisuktuaq God-mun ukpiqtuksraupiaqtuq God-iqaġniḷugu, suli paqitillaniḷugu tamatkunuŋa ivaqłiapiaqtuanun inmiñik. "
7096," By faith Noah, when he was warned about things not yet seen, with reverent regard constructed an ark for the deliverance of his family. Through faith he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.","Noah-m ukpiġiŋagaa God uqallautimmani suna piñiaqtilaaŋanik. Tautuŋaitkaluaŋŋaan uliqpaktuksraq, arguaginiḷugu God, umiaqpiŋaruq annautisukługich igluqatini. Umiaqpivḷuni salapqiŋagaa ukpiġutairrutaat nunam iñuŋisa aasii suksraunġiqsauŋarut. Pisigivlugu Noah-m ukpiġutaa God-im akuqtuŋagaa."
7097," By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place he would later receive as an inheritance, and he went out without understanding where he was going. ","Ukpiġutiqaqłuni, Abraham kamaksriŋaruq God-im ququaġmani aullaquvlugu nunamun aitchuusiaġiyumaakkaġmiñun kiŋuvaaġitqulugu. Tavra aullaŋaruq, nalullaġmi sumun aullaġniaqtilaamiñik. "
7098," By faith he lived as a foreigner in the promised land as though it were a foreign country, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were fellow heirs of the same promise. ","Ukpiġutiqaqłuni tuyuġmiaġuŋaruq nunami God-im unniqsuqłiisaani inmiŋnun, tupiqtuqłutiŋ allami nunami inmatun. Tainnatuttauq Isaac-lu Jacob-lu tupiqtuŋammiuk kiŋuvaannaktaaksraunmiŋni taavrumani nunami unniqsuqłiisauruami. "
7099," For he was looking forward to the city with firm foundations, whose architect and builder is God. ","Qanuq Abraham niġiugaqaŋaruq iniqpaŋmik nuktaŋitchuamik iñuuviksramiñik, God-im payaŋaiqł̣ugu nappakkaŋanik ilaan isumamigun."
7100," By faith, even though Sarah herself was barren and he was too old, he received the ability to procreate, because he regarded the one who had given the promise to be trustworthy. ","Ukpiġutiqaqłuni, Sarah aaquaŋagaluallaġmi siŋaiyaupkaqtauŋaruq, qanuq ukpiġiŋagaa piḷḷaruaguvlugu God unniqsuqłiiŋaruaq. "
7101, So in fact children were fathered by one man – and this one as good as dead – like the number of stars in the sky and like the innumerable grains of sand on the seashore. ,"Tavraasii Abraham-miñ, iñuŋmiñ atautchimiñ tuquŋaruatun iḷiŋaruamiñ, aniŋarut kiŋuniġiich iñugiaktigiliqł̣utiŋ uvluġiaŋisun qiḷaum, kisiññaisigiruatullu qaviaŋatun taġium siñaata."
7102," These all died in faith without receiving the things promised, but they saw them in the distance and welcomed them and acknowledged that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth. ","Tamatkua iluqaġmiŋ tuquŋarut ukpiġutiqaqłutiŋ aitchuusiaġigaluaġnagich unniqsuqłiisauruat, aglaan iḷisimavlutiŋ taŋŋiġñiaqtilaaŋannik quviatchaktitauŋarut. Piiḷaaġiŋaitkaat iglaagutilaaqtiŋ tuyuġmiagutilaaqtiglu nunami. "
7103, For those who speak in such a way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. ,Iñuich tainna uqaqtuat nalupqinaiġaat niġiuktilaaqtiŋ aimaaġviksramik qiḷaŋmi. 
7104," In fact, if they had been thinking of the land that they had left, they would have had opportunity to return. ","Isumagiŋagumirruŋ taimña nuna qimakkaqtiŋ, utiġumiñaŋagaluaqtut pisukkumiŋ. "
7105," But as it is, they aspire to a better land, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore, God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them. ","Aglaan iliŋich kipiġniuŋarut iñuusukłutiŋ nakuułhaaqtuami aimaaġviŋmi, qiḷaŋmiittuami. Taamna pisigivlugu God-im kanŋusuutigiŋitkaa tairaugumi ilaisa God-iŋannik, aasii itqanaiyautiŋagai iniqpaŋmik."
7106," By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac. He had received the promises, yet he was ready to offer up his only son. ","Abraham uuktuaqtaukami ukpiġutiqaqłuni kamagiŋagaa God, aasii aitchuutigivlugu Isaac ikipkautiksrauvlugu. Taamna aitchuusiaqaŋaruaq unniqsuqłiiñmik iñugiaktuanik kiŋuniksranik itqanaiñŋaruq aitchuutigisukługuunnii iġñitualuni, "
7107," God had told him, “Through Isaac descendants will carry on your name,” ","unniqsuqłiiŋagaluaqtillugu God inna, Isaac-kuaġlutiŋ kiŋuniqtin iñukpalliġñiaqtut. "
7108," and he reasoned that God could even raise him from the dead, and in a sense he received him back from there. ","Abraham nalupqigiŋaitkaa God aŋipkaiyumiñaqtilaaŋanik Isaac-mik tuqqunmiñ. Tavra tainna pimman, iġñini aitchuusiaġitqiŋagaa iñuuvlugu, tuquŋaruatun iḷigaluaqtuaq. "
7109, By faith also Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the future. ,Isaac ukpiġutiqaqłuni uqallaŋaruq iġñagmiñun Jacob-mullu Esau-mullu God-mun aitchuutiginiaġnivḷugich quviasaaġusiat piyumaaqtuat. 
7110," By faith Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped as he leaned on his staff. ","Jacob tuquaqsikami, ukpiġutiqaqłuni uqallautiŋagik atausiullaavlugik iġñiŋik Joseph piḷḷuatausiaqaquvlugik, sikimmivḷuni aŋaiyyuŋaruq ayauppiaqsimaaqłuni."
7111," By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, mentioned the exodus of the sons of Israel and gave instructions about his burial.","Joseph, tuquyasikami, ukpiġutiqaqłuni uqallausiġiŋagaa aullaġniksrautaat Israel-guruat Egypt-miñ. Aasii nalupqigiŋił̣ł̣ugu aullaġniaqtilaaŋat, piraksriiŋaruq aullatitquvlugu iḷuviñi."
7112," By faith, when Moses was born, his parents hid him for three months, because they saw the child was beautiful and they were not afraid of the king’s edict. ","Moses animman aŋayuqaak ukpiġutiqaqłutik, iriqsimaŋagaak tatqiñi piŋasuni. Tautukamitku miqłiqtułhiñauŋitpalliġman, sivuuġagiŋaitkaak kamaksriŋiññiksraq umialgum pitqurriutaanik aŋugaurat tuqutquvlugich. "
7113," By faith, when he grew up, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter, ","Moses ukpiġutiqaqłuni God-mun aŋutiġuanikami, iñuusuŋiñŋaruq iġñiġuluni Pharoah-m panianun, "
7114, choosing rather to be ill-treated with the people of God than to enjoy sin’s fleeting pleasure. ,tigusiaġiłhaaqługu pigiitchuakun aŋalatauniq piqatigilugich God-im iñuŋi aliasuŋisaaġutiqallagniġmiñ piḷuutinik piiġaqtuanik. 
7115," He regarded abuse suffered for Christ to be greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for his eyes were fixed on the reward. ","Ilaa nagliksaaŋaruq pimaqłuktausiaqaqłuni piqatigivlugich iñuŋi God-im, nagliksaaġmatun Christ pisigivlugu. Aasii isummatigiŋagaa nagliksaaġniq anniqsuutaułhaaqługu suġaliŋiñiñ Egypt, qanuq ilaa ukpipiaŋaruq God-mun akiḷiġñiaġnivḷuni."
7116," By faith he left Egypt without fearing the king’s anger, for he persevered as though he could see the one who is invisible. ","Ukpiġutiqaqłuni Moses qimaŋagaa Egypt, iqsigiŋaiqł̣ugu qinnautaa umialgum qanuq sivunmuuŋaruq iñuktun tautuaġiruatun God-mik tautugnaitchuamik. "
7117," By faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood, so that the one who destroyed the firstborn would not touch them. ","Moses ukpiġiŋagaa God uqallautimmani piraksriqł̣ugich iñuich imnaiyaam auŋanik qivsaliquvlugich upkuat avatiŋich, God-im isaġulganun tuqqutauruamun tuqutquŋił̣ł̣ugich aŋayukłich miqłiqtuŋich, miqłiqtuŋisun tuqutauruatun Egypt-miut."

7119, By faith the walls of Jericho fell after the people marched around them for seven days. ,Ukpiġutaatigun Israel-guruat katchiġruaŋi Jericho-m ulġupkaqtauŋarut kaivaluqqaaqługich tallimat malġugni uvluni.

7132," Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up. ","Isumalaaġutigisiuŋ Jesus. Igḷutuiŋaruq qanutupayauraq piaqłuktautinik piḷuusiqiriniñ, tainnatulli ilivsi piyuaqsiġuvsi piḷaiŋitchumausi qapiŋasiŋiḷḷusiḷu. "
7133, You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin. ,Qanuq ilivsi aŋuyaŋaitchusi piḷuunmik maqitchisałhiñaaġuġlusi auvsiññik. 
7134, And have you forgotten the exhortation addressed to you as sons?,"Piiguŋasugnaqtusi God-im uqaluanik tuqłuutiqaqtuamik ilivsiññun iġñinik,"
7135,"“My son, do not scorn the Lord’s discipline ","Taamna pisigilugu, qapiŋaimmaġiksaaġitchi ukpiqsimaaġlusiḷu tatavsaqtaukavsi. "

7137, “For the Lord disciplines the one he loves and chastises every son he accepts.”,"Iñupayaanun aŋuyautairrutiqaġitchi, ilaaguaqtaulusiḷu God-mun. Taapkuak piiḷḷugik, kialiqaa tautukkumiñaitkaa Ataniq. "
7138, Endure your suffering as discipline; God is treating you as sons. For what son is there that a father does not discipline? ,"Qaunagisitchi iluqasi iñuusuglusi God-im ikayuutaagun.

7140," Besides, we have experienced discipline from our earthly fathers and we respected them; shall we not submit ourselves all the more to the Father of spirits and receive life? ","Qanuq iḷisimarusi aquvatigun, ilaa kipiġniutchakkaluaqami piññaktaaġisukługu kiŋuvaannaktaaksrautikkaluani, ilaa itigaurraŋaruq.

7145," Pursue peace with everyone, and holiness, for without it no one will see the Lord. ","Aglaan qaiŋarusi Iġġianun Zion iniqpaŋanun iñuuruam God-im, Jerusalem-mun qiḷaŋmiittuamun, isaġuliŋnullu kisiññaġumiñaitchuanun quviasukłutiŋ kasimaruat, "
7146," See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God, that no one be like a bitter root springing up and causing trouble, and through him many become defiled.

7148," For you know that later when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no opportunity for repentance, although he sought the blessing with tears. ","Qaunagisitchi kamagisuglugu God uqaqtuaq. Qanuq taipkua kamaksriŋitchuat Moses-mik tatavsaqtauŋarut, uvagut tatavsaqtaułhaaġniaqtugut kamagisuŋitkuptigu God. "
7149," For you have not come to something that can be touched, to a burning fire and darkness and gloom and a whirlwind ","Ilaan nipiłhiñaŋata taimani aulayyaŋagaa nuna, paŋmapak-aasii ilaa unniqsuqłiiŋaruq, “Atausivsaami aulayyaksiññaġniaŋitkiga nuna aglaan qiḷaglu.” "
7150, and the blast of a trumpet and a voice uttering words such that those who heard begged to hear no more. ,"Taamna uqallaun, “Atausivsaamiiġun,” sivuniqaqtuq sut aŋalayyaktauyumiñaqtuat piiqsauniaqtut, qanuq savaaguŋarut. Sut aulayyaktauyumiñaitchuat itchumaaqtut isuitchuamun. "

7152," In fact, the scene was so terrifying that Moses said, “I shudder with fear.” ",qanuq God-ikput ikinnillaruatun igniqtun ittuq.
7153," But you have come to Mount Zion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of angels, to the assembly ",
7154," and congregation of the firstborn, who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous, who have been made perfect, ",
7155," and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks of something better than Abel’s does.",
7156," Take care not to refuse the one who is speaking! For if they did not escape when they refused the one who warned them on earth, how much less shall we, if we reject the one who warns from heaven? ",
7157," Then his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, “I will once more shake not only the earth but heaven too.” ",
7158," Now this phrase “once more” indicates the removal of what is shaken, that is, of created things, so that what is unshaken may remain. ",
7159," So since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us give thanks, and through this let us offer worship pleasing to God in devotion and awe. ",
7160, For our God is indeed a devouring fire.,
7161," From James, a slave of God and the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes dispersed abroad. Greetings! ","James, kivgaŋa God-im Atanġuvlu Jesus Christ, tuyuqtuq paġlatinik iluqaiññun God-im iñuŋiñun siaminŋaruanun iluqaani nunami."
7162," My brothers and sisters, consider it nothing but joy when you fall into all sorts of trials, ","Aniqatiimaaŋ, quviasupiaġitchi uuktuaqtaukavsi allakaaġiiñik uuktuaġutinik, "
7163, because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance. ,qanuq iḷisimarusi uuktuaġusiaŋa ukpiġutivsi tuniqsiḷiġutigigiksi. 
7164," And let endurance have its perfect effect, so that you will be perfect and complete, not deficient in anything. ","Aasii tuniqsimatuiññaġitchi supayaami, ataramik piḷusi God-im piḷġusiġitqukkaŋiñik iluqaiññik, ataramik iñuusiqaġumausi iviġaumasuglugu God, sunik piŋaiġḷusi iviġaumanaitchuanik ilaanun. "
7165," But if anyone is deficient in wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to all generously and without reprimand, and it will be given to him. ","Kiñapayaaq isumattutaiḷḷiuġumi, qiññuaġli God-miñ aasii isumattutiksriññiaġaa. Qanuq God aitchuiḷḷaruq iñupayaanun nauttaasuŋaġnani, qiññuaġniġaqłilaitchuġlu. "
7166," But he must ask in faith without doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed around by the wind. ","Aglaan apiqsriḷi ukpiġutiqaġluni, nalupqisuutaiḷḷuni suuramikunnii, qanuq iñuk nalupqisuktuaq ittuq qaiḷḷiŋatun taġium uŋugrugikkaŋatun nalluakkaŋatullu anuġim. "
7167," For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord, ",Iñuk tainnaittuaq isumanani aitchuusiaqaġniaġasugaluni supayaamik Ataniġmiñ. 
7168," since he is a double-minded individual, unstable in all his ways.",Qanuq malġuutchiŋaruamik isumalik tuniqsimaruaguŋitchuq suraġaġnipayaamiñi.
7169, Now the believer of humble means should take pride in his high position. ,"Aniqan iḷiappauruaq mattumani nunami quviasuktuksrauruq God-im kamanaqsipkaġmani, "
7170," But the rich person’s pride should be in his humiliation, because he will pass away like a wildflower in the meadow. ","tainnatun suli suġalliruaq aniqan God-im kamanaiqsinmani, qanuq ukpiqtuat atirut God-mun. Suġalliruaq nautchiatun tuquliruatun piñiaqtuq. "
7171, For the sun rises with its heat and dries up the meadow; the petal of the flower falls off and its beauty is lost forever. So also the rich person in the midst of his pursuits will wither away. ,"Qanuq siqiñiq nuimman pasiŋñaqtuam uunnaŋata panaqłukkai ivgich nautchiallu, aasii nautchiat katakłutiŋ, qiñiyunaiqł̣utiglu, tainnatun suġalliruaq tuquliñiaqtuq piḷġutchimiñi."
7172," Happy is the one who endures testing, because when he has proven to be genuine, he will receive the crown of life that God promised to those who love him. ","Quviasugli iñuk igḷutuiruaq uuktuaġusiamik, qanuq igḷutuanikkumiuŋ uuktuaġusiaq, aitchuusiaqaġniaqtuq isuitchuamik iñuggunmik, God-im unniqsuqłiisaanik akiḷiutiginiaġnivḷugu tamatkunuŋa piviuttaġirimiñun. "
7173," Let no one say when he is tempted, “I am tempted by God,” for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. ","Kiñapayaaq ikł̣igutchaktinniaqtaukami uqallaŋnani, Ikł̣igutchaktinniaġaaŋa God-im. Qanuq God ikł̣igutchaktitauyumiñaitchuq piḷuktuamun, suli ikł̣igutchaktitchiñialaitchuq kimigliqaa iñuŋmik. "
7174, But each one is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desires. ,"Aglaan uvva iñullaa ikł̣igutchaktinniaqtauraqtuq kaviuġuksaaqtaukami, inataukamiḷu kipiġniuġunmiñun. "
7175," Then when desire conceives, it gives birth to sin, and when sin is full grown, it gives birth to death. ","Aasii ilaan kipiġniuġunmi pigiitchuat payarimmanni piḷuusiqisuuruq, aasii iñuk piḷuutiŋisa suksraunġiqsaupkalġiñaġniaġaat."
7176," Do not be led astray, my dear brothers and sisters. ","Piviuttaġikkavsi aniqatiit, sagluqipkaġnasi. "
7177," All generous giving and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or the slightest hint of change. ","Iluqaġmiŋ aitchuutigiksuat inuaŋaitchuallu aitchuutit paŋmaŋŋaqtaurut, qaisaŋi God-im savaŋaruam qaummatipayauranik. Ilaa allaŋŋulaitchuq inŋitchuġlu taġġaqtun allaŋŋuqtaqtuatun. "
7178," By his sovereign plan he gave us birth through the message of truth, that we would be a kind of firstfruits of all he created.","God-im pisuunmigun anitqiksinŋagaatigut uqaluagun iḷumun ittuam, uvagut iniqaqqaaquvluta savaapayauramiñiñ."
7179," Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters! Let every person be quick to listen, slow to speak, slow to anger. ","Piviuttaġikkavsii aniqatiit, iḷisimasiuŋ una. Iñupayaaq ataramik itqanaiḷḷi naalaġniñiġmun aglaan uqallayaiḷḷuni, qinnayaiḷḷuniḷu, "
7180, For human anger does not accomplish God’s righteousness. ,qanuq iñuk qinnakami taŋŋiiḷaitchuq God-im nalaunŋatqutaanik. 
7181," So put away all filth and evil excess and humbly welcome the message implanted within you, which is able to save your souls. ","Taamna pisigilugu iñuusiqaŋaiġitchi pigiitchuamik, piugaŋaiġḷugich God-im pigiiññiraŋi. Aglaan kamasaaŋaiġḷusi kamagisigik God-im uqaluŋi, ilaan iḷitchuġipkaŋakkaŋi ilivsiññun annaurrautquvlusi."
7182, But be sure you live out the message and do not merely listen to it and so deceive yourselves. ,"Uqalua God-im kamagisiuŋ. Naalaġnigiññaġuvsiuŋ uqaluk, sagluqirusi ilivsiññik. "
7183," For if someone merely listens to the message and does not live it out, he is like someone who gazes at his own face in a mirror. ","Qanuq kiñapayaaq naalaġniraugiññaqtuaq uqaluŋmun kamagigaluaġnagu, iñuktun ittuq taġġaqtuqtuatun kiiññamiñik. "
7184, For he gazes at himself and then goes out and immediately forgets what sort of person he was. ,Qanuq tautuktuq inmiñik aasii aullaqami piiguaniktiġaa qanuq qiññaqaqtilaani. 
7185," But the one who peers into the perfect law of liberty and fixes his attention there, and does not become a forgetful listener but one who lives it out – he will be blessed in what he does. ","Aglaan iñuk tainnainŋitchuq qiñiqtuiññaqtuaq God-im pitquraŋiñun nalaunŋaruanun atanġiqsitchiḷḷaruanun iñuŋnik.

7186," If someone thinks he is religious yet does not bridle his tongue, and so deceives his heart, his religion is futile. ","Kiñaliqaa isummatigigumi iḷumun ukpiqtuaguniḷuni aŋalatchuiḷḷaan uqaluni, sagluqiruq inmiñik. Taavruma iñuum ukpiqtuaguniŋa taŋiġitchuq. "
7187, Pure and undefiled religion before God the Father is this: to care for orphans and widows in their misfortune and to keep oneself unstained by the world.,"Uvva innaittuq God-im nalaunŋarualikkaŋa iḷumutullu ittualivḷugu ukpiqtuaguniq, takulugich aŋayuqaagiŋaruat, uiḷgaŋaruallu piiḷḷiuqpata, suli qaunagiluni inmiñik piḷuksisuŋiḷḷuni nunam iñuŋisun."
7188," My brothers and sisters, do not show prejudice if you possess faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ. ","Aniqatiimaaŋ, ukpiqtuagukavsi Ataniptiŋnun Jesus Christ-mun kamanaqtuaguruamun, suuramikunnii aŋalannagich iñuich allagiiksitaġlugich. "
7189," For if someone comes into your assembly wearing a gold ring and fine clothing, and a poor person enters in filthy clothes, ","Qanuq suġalliruaq iñuk kaviqsuamik qitiqłiaġutilik annuġaaġipiaġataġmiḷuni isiqpan aŋaiyyuvivsiññun, suli iḷiappauruaq isiġmiḷuni annuġaaluktuġluni, "
7190," do you pay attention to the one who is finely dressed and say, “You sit here in a good place,” and to the poor person, “You stand over there,” or “Sit on the floor”? ","aasii ilivsi qaunagiłhaagaqsiguvsiuŋ annuġaaġipiaġataqtuaq aasii uqallautilugu, Aquvittin uvuŋa inilluatamun, aasiiḷi uqallautilugu iḷiappauruaq, Makitaiñ takanani, naagga, Aquvittin natiġmun saniġaannun aquppiutama, "
7191," If so, have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil motives? ","allakaaġiiksitaġisi iñuich akunnavsiññi, isivġiqł̣ugich pigiitchuanik isumaqaqłusi. "
7192," Listen, my dear brothers and sisters! Did not God choose the poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who love him? ","Piviuttaġikkavsii aniqatiit, naalaġnisitchi, God-im piksraqtaaġiŋagai piiḷḷiuqtuat mattumani nunami piiḷḷiuquŋił̣ł̣ugich ukpiġunmi, kiŋuvaannaquvlugiḷḷu atanniqsimaviŋmiñi unniqsuqłiisauŋaruamik ilaan piviuttaġirimiñun. "
7193, But you have dishonored the poor! Are not the rich oppressing you and dragging you into the courts? ,Tavra suksraġiŋiñŋagiksi iḷiappauruaq. Nalliŋisa nagriaġisuuvasi isivġiqsiñuutivlusiḷu? Suġalliruat. 
7194, Do they not blaspheme the good name of the one you belong to? ,Iliŋisa uqamaqłuutigisuugaat taamna atilluataq God-im aitchuutaa ilivsiññun.
7195," But if you fulfill the royal law as expressed in this scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” you are doing well. ","Nalaunŋarualiqiniaqtusi kamagiguvsiuŋ God-im pitquraŋa, Bible uqalugikkaŋat inna, “Piviuttaġisaġiñ siḷalliñ iliktun iḷiḷugu.” "
7196," But if you show prejudice, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as violators. ","Aglaan allakaaġiiksitaġuvsigik iñuich qiññaŋatigun, piḷuusiqirusi. Aasii pitqurat pasiñiaġaasi kipuqłaiñiḷusi. "
7197, For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it. ,Qanuq kiñapayaaq kamaksriŋitchuaq iḷaŋannik pitqurat pasirauruq kamaksriŋitchualivḷugu iluqaiññik pitquranik. 
7198," For he who said, “Do not commit adultery,” also said, “Do not murder.” Now if you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a violator of the law. ","Qanuq God uqaqtuq, Allatuġnak, aasiisuli uqallakłuni, Iñuaġnak. Tavra allatuŋitkaluaġuvich aglaan iñuaġlutin, kamaksriŋitchutin pitquranik. "
7199, Speak and act as those who will be judged by a law that gives freedom. ,Tavra uqaġitchi iñuulusiḷu tamatkunatun iñuktun isivġiqsauyumaaqtuatun pitquratigun atanġiqsitchiḷḷaruatigun iñuŋnik. 
7200, For judgment is merciless for the one who has shown no mercy. But mercy triumphs over judgment.,"Qanuq iñuk nagliksralaitchuaq God-im nagliginiaŋiñmigaa isivġiġumiuŋ, aglaan nagliktuun akimaniaqtuq nagliktauruaq isivġiqsaukpan."
7201," What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but does not have works? Can this kind of faith save him? ","Aniqatiimaaŋ, iñuk uqaqtuaq ukpiġutiqaġnivḷuni aasii anniqsuiñiaŋiḷḷuni allanik, ukpiġutaata anniqsuġumiñaqpauŋ? Ukpiġutaan tainnaittuam annautiyumiñaitkaa. "
7202," If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacks daily food, ","Aniqan annuġaagiḷḷiuqpan niqiksraiḷḷiuġluniḷu, "
7203," and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, keep warm and eat well,” but you do not give them what the body needs, what good is it? ","qanuġlugu anniqsuġumiñaitkaa uqallautigiññaġlugu inna, God-im quviasuusiġḷisin, uunnaagiñ niġiḷḷuataġlutillu, aitchuġaluaġnagu pigiraksraġiraŋiñik iñuuniaġniġmi. Tainnasiq ukpiġutaupiaqpa? "
7204," So also faith, if it does not have works, is dead being by itself. ","Ukpiġutiqaġniq ikayuġniasuŋaġnagich allat iñuich iḷumutun ukpiġutauŋitchuq, tuquŋaruatun ittuq."
7205," But someone will say, “You have faith and I have works.” Show me your faith without works and I will show you faith by my works. ","Aglaan iñuk iḷaanni uqallagniaġmiuq iñuŋmun, Ukpiġutiqaqsiññaqtutin aasiiḷi uvaŋa ukpiġutiqaqtuŋa anniqsuiñiaqłuŋa allanik. Tautuktinŋa ukpiġutiŋnik anniqsuiñiaġaluaġnak, uvaŋali anniqsuiñiaġnipkuŋ tautuktinniaġikpiñ ukpiġutimnik. "
7206, You believe that God is one; well and good. Even the demons believe that – and tremble with fear.,"Tavra uqaqtutin ukpiġnivḷutin atausiunivḷugu God, taamna nakuuruq. Ilitqusiqł̣uitchauq ukpiġigaat taamna, aasii iliŋich uuliksisuurut sivuuġavlutiŋ. "
7207," But would you like evidence, you empty fellow, that faith without works is useless? ","Isumalaaŋitchuatiin iñuuk, iḷisautitquyumavich ukpiġun anniqsuiñialaitchuaq suuŋisilaaŋanik? "
7208, Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered Isaac his son on the altar? ,Isumalaaġutigisiuŋ maŋŋuqput Abraham. Qanuqłuni nalaunŋasirauŋava God-im sivuġaani? God-im iḷisimaŋagaa nalaunŋaruagutilaaŋanik ukpiġunmiñi pisigivlugu aitchuutigiyumiñaġmagu iġñini Isaac niġrutitun iḷivḷugu ikipkaiviŋmun. 
7209, You see that his faith was working together with his works and his faith was perfected by works. ,"Iḷitchuġisitchi ilaan ukpiġivaił̣ł̣ugu God piyummatiqaŋaruq supayauramik God-im piraksriqpani. Taavruma piraŋata nalupqinaiŋagaa ukpiġutiqapiaqtilaaŋanik, "
7210," And the scripture was fulfilled that says, “Now Abraham believed God and it was counted to him for righteousness,” and he was called God’s friend. ","aasii Bible uqaluŋich taŋŋiqsauŋarut uqaluqaqtuat inna, “Abraham ukpiġiŋagaa God, aasii taavruma nalaunŋasiŋagaa sivuġaani God-im.” Aasii ilaa tairauŋaruq avilaitqataanik God-im. "
7211, You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. ,Iḷitchuġirusi tasamma iñuum nalaunŋasipkaqtautilaaŋanik savaalluatatigun ukpiġutiłhiñaŋiḷaakun.
7212," And similarly, was not Rahab the prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent them out by another way? ","Aasiivsauq Rahab, sivuani allatuqtauŋagaluaqtuaq, uuktuutauyumiñaġmiuq ukpiġutim anniqsuiḷḷatilaaŋanik. Ilaa nalaunŋarualirauŋaruq anniqsuiñiġmigun tukkuliikami kivgauruanik suli aullaqtiłługich allakun apqutikun. "
7213," For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead.","Tavra timitun tuquŋaruatun ilitqusiq piiġman timimiñ, tainnatun ukpiġun tuquŋammiuq anniqsuiñiaŋiññami."
7214," Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers and sisters, because you know that we will be judged more strictly. ","Aniqatiimaaŋ, iñugiaktuasii iḷisaurriġuġnasi, qanuq iḷisimarusi uvagut iḷisaurriruaguut isivġiusiaqaġniaqtugut tuniqtulluktuamik allaniñ. "
7215," For we all stumble in many ways. If someone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect individual, able to control the entire body as well. ","Qanuq iluqata killukuaġuurugut iñugiaktuatigun, aasii kiñaliqaa killukualaitchuaq uqaluŋmigun, ilaa iñulluatapiaguruq, aŋalataġillasiŋavlugu iluqaan timi. "
7216," And if we put bits into the mouths of horses to get them to obey us, then we guide their entire bodies. ","Kiŋmiġusiġuugivut tuttuqpaich qaniŋisigun kamagitquvluta, aulataġillagivut sumun aullaġukapta. "
7217," Look at ships too: Though they are so large and driven by harsh winds, they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the pilot’s inclination directs. ","Isummatigisigik umiaqpaich. Qanutun kamanaqtigigaluaqtut anuġiqpaum tiŋillavlugich, aulatiqaqtut aquutikułłuuramik sumupayaaq aqutim pisuutaa sivunniġman. "
7218," So too the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it has great pretensions. Think how small a flame sets a huge forest ablaze. ","Tainnatuttauq uqaq mikigaluaqtuq iḷagikkaŋa timim, qanutun uqavigaaġuutigiruq sunik kamanaqtuanik. Ignikułłuuram ikuallaktillagai napaaqtusalaich. "
7219, And the tongue is a fire! The tongue represents the world of wrongdoing among the parts of our bodies. It pollutes the entire body and sets fire to the course of human existence – and is set on fire by hell.,"Tainnatuttauq uqaq igniqtun inmiuq, Uqqam salapqiġuugai iñuum isumagiirrutiŋi salapqiqł̣ugu iluqaan pigiitchuapayaaq iḷisimakkaŋat iñupayaurat.

7220," For every kind of animal, bird, reptile, and sea creature is subdued and has been subdued by humankind. ","Qanusipayaat niġrutit, tiŋmiallu, paamġuqtuallu, taġiuvlu niġrutiŋi, iñuum pamiqsaaġillagai. "
7221," But no human being can subdue the tongue; it is a restless evil, full of deadly poison. ","Aglaan kialiqaa iñugruiññaum aŋalallasiyumiñaitkaa pamiqsaatun uqaq pigiitchuaq, siḷivinŋaruaq tuqunamik. "
7222," With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse people made in God’s image. ","Uqqaptiŋnik nanġaġuugikput Ataniq, Aapalu, suli uqqaptiŋnik uqamaqłuutivlugich iñuich savaaguruat arriŋatun God-im. "
7223," From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. These things should not be so, my brothers and sisters. ","Qanuq atautchimiñ qaniġmiñ qairuk quviasaaġullu uqamaqłuullu. Aniqatiimaaŋ, taamna tainnaittuksrauŋitkaluaqtuq. "
7224," A spring does not pour out fresh water and bitter water from the same opening, does it? ",Imiġiksuaġlu taġiuġnitchuaġlu maqiyumiñaitchuk atautchimiñ maqsraluktuamiñ imiġmiñ. 
7225," Can a fig tree produce olives, my brothers and sisters, or a vine produce figs? Neither can a salt water spring produce fresh water.","Aniqatiimaaŋ, fig napaaqtua nauriyumiñaitchuq olive-nik, naaggaunnii grape napaaqtuayaaŋa fig-nik. Tainnaptauq taġiuġnitchuaq imiq maqiyumiñaitchuq taġiuġniitchuamik."
7226, Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct he should show his works done in the gentleness that wisdom brings. ,Kiña akunnavsiññi isumaturuaguva kaŋiqsisiqaqpalu? Isumattutiqaqtilaani kaŋiqsisiqaqtilaaniḷu iḷisimanaqtilliuŋ iñuulluataunmigun savaalluatamigullu kamasaaŋaiġḷuni isumattutiqaġluniḷu. 
7227," But if you have bitter jealousy and selfishness in your hearts, do not boast and tell lies against the truth. ","Aglaan uumisuutiqaqtuiññaġuvsi killuqsraunmiglu siŋñanmiglu isumatuniḷusi kamasaaġnasi, saglutigilugu God-im iḷumun ittuaŋa. "
7228," Such wisdom does not come from above but is earthly, natural, demonic. ","Qanuq tainnasiq isumattun qairuaguŋitchuq God-miñ, aglaan iñugruiññaġniñ, piḷuksisuguuruaniñ iñuutchivsiññiñ Tuunġaġmiḷḷu. "
7229," For where there is jealousy and selfishness, there is disorder and every evil practice. ","Qanuq iñuich killuqqutimmata siŋñarrautimmatalu atiŋirrutinikkayuktut, qanusipayaaġlu pigiitchualiqiniq iḷivḷuni. "
7230," But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, accommodating, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial, and not hypocritical. ","Aglaan isumattutim paŋmaŋŋaqtauruam iñuk piḷuutaisitkaa aŋuyautairrutiqaqtitkaalu pikałaktautairrutiqaqtitkaalu uqayunaqtitkaalu, suli nagliktuiḷḷatuqpaktuq anniqsuiḷḷaturuġlu, atunim aŋalatkai iñuich, naagga piŋŋuaġutaitchuq.

7231, And the fruit that consists of righteousness is planted in peace among those who make peace.,Aasii iñuich atisipkaiñiaqtuaguruat nalaunŋaruakun iñuich iñuuniaqatigiiksillagaich piisinniaqługu atiŋirrun.
7232," Where do the conflicts and where do the quarrels among you come from? Is it not from this, from your passions that battle inside you? ",Sum aullaqisaaġuuvagich aŋuyautit qanaaġutillu akunnavsiññi? Iñukpalliġuurut pigiitchuaniñ pisuutivsiññiñ iñiqługu qalanmatun ittuamiñ iḷuvsiññiñ. 
7233, You desire and you do not have; you murder and envy and you cannot obtain; you quarrel and fight. You do not have because you do not ask; ,"Kipiġniuġaluaġaqtusi piqaġukłusi pigiliutillammiñaġiḷḷu, taimmaasii iñuaqsałhiñaaġuqłusi.

7234," you ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly, so you can spend it on your passions.","Apiqsrigaluaġmiraqtusi aitchuusiaqalaitchusi, qanuq apiqsrisuuvlusi killukuaŋaruakun, atuġuqługich ilivsi aliasuŋisaaġutivsiññun. "
7235," Adulterers, do you not know that friendship with the world means hostility toward God? So whoever decides to be the world’s friend makes himself God’s enemy. ","Ukpiġnaitchuasii iñuich, naluvisiuŋ avilaitqatauniq nunam iñuŋiñun piḷuusiqisuuruanun akiḷḷiḷiqsuutautilaaŋanik God-mun? Tavraasii kiñapayaaq avilaitqatauruaq nunam iñuŋiñun, aŋuyyiruq inmiñik God-mun. "
7236," Or do you think the scripture means nothing when it says, “The spirit that God caused to live within us has an envious yearning”? ","Isumavisi taŋiġiḷamik Bible uqaġasugalugich uqallakamiŋ inna, Ilitqusiq God-im iḷiraŋa iñuŋmun mumiŋaruq tutchutikun kipiġniuġutinun. "
7237," But he gives greater grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but he gives grace to the humble.” ","Aglaan taavrumaŋŋa kipiġniuġunmiñ suaŋałhaaqtuq God-im nagliktuutiqpakun ikayuun aitchuutaa. Taamna pisigivlugu Bible uqaluŋich uqaqtut inna, “God-im akiḷḷiḷiqsuġai kamasaaqtuat, aglaan aitchuiruq nagliktuutiqpaŋmik kamasaaŋitchuanun.” "
7238, So submit to God. But resist the devil and he will flee from you. ,Aŋalallisi God-im. Akiḷḷiḷiqsuqsiuŋ Tuunġaq aasii pigruġniaqtuq ilivsiññiñ. 
7239," Draw near to God and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and make your hearts pure, you double-minded. ","Qalliḷaaġitchi God-mun, ilaaptauq qalliḷaaġniaġmiuq ilivsiññun.

7240," Grieve, mourn, and weep. Turn your laughter into mourning and your joy into despair. ","Nunuuraliġitchi isumaaġlusiḷu qialusiḷu piḷuutisi pisigilugich. Iglaqhaaqtaġniqsi mumigḷi qirratiġuġluni, suli quviasuutiksi ipiqtusuutiġuġluni. "
7241, Humble yourselves before the Lord and he will exalt you.,"Kamanaiġitchi ilivsiññik sivuġaani God-im, aasiiḷi ilaan kamanaqsipkaġniaġaasi."
7242," Do not speak against one another, brothers and sisters. He who speaks against a fellow believer or judges a fellow believer speaks against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge. ","Aniqatiimaaŋ, uqautikkutinasi pigiitchuamik avanmun.

Ilaa kisimi annaurriḷḷaruq suksraunġiiḷḷavluniḷu. Aglaalli kiunasugivich isivġiqsuatiin siḷalliġñik?
7244," Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into this or that town and spend a year there and do business and make a profit.” ","Naalaġnisiŋa, ilivsi uqaqtuasii inna, Uvlupak naagga uvlaakun aullaġniaqtugut nunaaqqimun aasii ukiiḷuta taamani tauqsiqsuġluta maniññaksaġluta. "
7245, You do not know about tomorrow. What is your life like? For you are a puff of smoke that appears for a short time and then vanishes. ,"Tainna uqaqtutin nalullaqpich uvlaakuksramik. Suuva iñuutchiñ? Taktugayaatun ittuq sivikitchuami illaktuatun, aasii taktuiqł̣uni. "
7246," You ought to say instead, “If the Lord is willing, then we will live and do this or that.” ","Innaaglaan uvva uqaġumiñaġaluaqtutin, Atanġum pisuutigikpagu, iñuuniaqtugut aasii piḷugu una naagga taiŋña. "
7247," But as it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil. ","Tainna uqallaŋisuaġuvsi, uqavigaaqtusi arguaŋŋativsiññi. Aasii iluqaġmi tainnasiq uqavigaaġun pigiitchuq. "
7248, So whoever knows what is good to do and does not do it is guilty of sin.,"Kiñaliqaa iḷisimagaluaqłuni nalaunŋaruamik piraksramik piŋiññamiuŋ, ilaa piḷuksiruq."
7249," From Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to those temporarily residing abroad (in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, the province of Asia, and Bithynia) who are chosen ","Peter, tiliraŋa Jesus Christ, tuyuqtuq God-im iñuksraqtaaŋiñun iñuuruanun pigruŋavlutiŋ nunaaqqiñun Pontus-mun Galatia-mullu Cappadocia-mullu Asia-mullu Bithynia-mullu. "
7250, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father by being set apart by the Spirit for obedience and for sprinkling with Jesus Christ’s blood. May grace and peace be yours in full measure!,"God-im Aapauruam piksraqtaaġiŋagaasi taimani miqłiqtuġisukłusi, sivunniŋavluni ilaaguaqtitquvlusi inmiñun Ilitqusiġiksuamun, sivunniŋavluniḷu iñuutquvlusi kamagiugaġlugu Jesus Christ, piḷuutaiŋammasi tuqukami maqipkaqługu auni.

7251," Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! By his great mercy he gave us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, ","Nanġaqtauli God Aapaŋa Atanipta Jesus Christ.

7255," Such trials show the proven character of your faith, which is much more valuable than gold – gold that is tested by fire, even though it is passing away – and will bring praise and glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. ","Uuktuaġusiavsi sivuniġigaat iḷumun itilaaqsaqługu ukpiġutiqapiaqtilaaqsi.

7258," Concerning this salvation, the prophets who predicted the grace that would come to you searched and investigated carefully. ","Taamna annaun uqaqtiŋisa God-im ivapiaŋagaluaġaat iḷitchuġiniaqługulu, aasii iliŋisa uqautigiŋagaich quviasuusiaksrautit God-im aitchuutiksrautiŋi ilivsiññun. "
7259, They probed into what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he testified beforehand about the sufferings appointed for Christ and his subsequent glory. ,"Tavra Christ Ilitqusian uqaqtinmatiŋ taavrumiŋa piyumaaqtuamik qakugukpan Christ nagliksaaġniksrautaanik aŋiñiksrautaaniglu, iḷisimayumaŋagaluaqtut qakugupiaq taamna piñiaqtilaaŋanik kisumullu iñuŋmun piñiaqtilaaŋanik. "
7260," They were shown that they were serving not themselves but you, in regard to the things now announced to you through those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven – things angels long to catch a glimpse of.","God-im taipkua uqaqtini iḷitchuġipkaŋagai tamatkua uqautigikkaŋich piyumaaŋiññivḷugich iliŋisa iñuuniŋanni, aglaan piñiaġnivḷugich aquvatigun ilivsi iñuunivsiññi.

7265," And if you address as Father the one who impartially judges according to each one’s work, live out the time of your temporary residence here in reverence. ","Aasii aŋaiyyukavsi taisuugiksi Aapamik.

7270, You have purified your souls by obeying the truth in order to show sincere mutual love. So love one another earnestly from a pure heart. ,Paŋmapak-aasii piḷuutaiqsauganikavsi kamaksrirraqsivḷusi God-im iḷumun ittuamik uqaluanik piviuttaqsriḷḷasirusi iḷumutun ukpiqtuaguqativsiññik.

7280, if you have experienced the Lord’s kindness.,Qanuq iḷitchuġianiŋagiksi pikałaktautairrutaa Atanġum.

7283," For it says in scripture, “Look, I lay in Zion a stone, a chosen and priceless cornerstone, and whoever believes in him will never be put to shame.” ","Qanuq Bible uqaluŋich uqaqtut inna,"
7284," So you who believe see his value, but for those who do not believe, the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, ","Aglaan ilivsi iñuksraqtaaġirauŋarusi, Umialgum aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaŋi, ilaaguaqtauvlutiŋ Nation-guruat, God-im nanmiñiq iñuŋi, piksraqtaaguruat quliaqtuaġitquvlugich aliuġnaqtuat savaaŋi God-im, taavruma ququaġiruam ilivsiññik taaqtuamiñ ilaan aliuġnaqtuamun qaummaġmiñun.

7297," For what credit is it if you sin and are mistreated and endure it? But if you do good and suffer and so endure, this finds favor with God. ",Ilaa piḷuusiqiŋaitchuq sumikunnii. Qaŋaunnii sagluŋaitchuq. 
7298," For to this you were called, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving an example for you to follow in his steps. ","Uqamaqłuurraukami, uqamaqłuunmik kiummatiŋaitchuq. Nagliksaaqami, sivuuġasaaqłiŋaitchuq, aglaan ukpiġiŋagaa God, isivġiiruaq nalaunŋaruakun. "

7300," When he was maligned, he did not answer back; when he suffered, he threatened no retaliation, but committed himself to God who judges justly. ","Qanuq tammaŋaruaguŋarusi imnaisun, aglaan paŋmapak utiŋarusi Imnaiḷiqirimun Qaunaksriŋannullu ilitqusivsi."
7301," He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we may cease from sinning and live for righteousness. By his wounds you were healed. ",
7302, For you were going astray like sheep but now you have turned back to the shepherd and guardian of your souls.,
7303," In the same way, wives, be subject to your own husbands. Then, even if some are disobedient to the word, they will be won over without a word by the way you live, ","Uiqaqtuasii, kamagisigik uisi, pisigilugich uiguruat iḷaŋich ukpiġutaitpata God-im uqaluanun, iḷaanni ukpiqtitauviaqtut ilivsi iñuulluataġnivsigun, uqautiŋiḷḷuġisiunnii, "

7309," Husbands, in the same way, treat your wives with consideration as the weaker partners and show them honor as fellow heirs of the grace of life. In this way nothing will hinder your prayers.","Tainnatuttauq uiguruasii nalaiñ iḷiuqsigik nuliasi, puttuqsrimaugaġlusi aġnat suaŋaił̣haaqtilaaŋannik aŋutiniñ.

7311," Do not return evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead bless others because you were called to inherit a blessing.

7312, For ,"Aglausimaruq Bible-ni inna,"
7313,the one who wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from uttering deceit. ,Paŋmapak sum imma anniaġumiñaqpasi kipiġniuttaġiguvsiuŋ nalaunŋaruaq? 
7314, And he must turn away from evil and do good; ,"Aglaattauq nagliksaaġaluaġuvsi pisigilugu nalaunŋarualiqiniq, quviasaaġusiaqaġniaqtusi. Sivuuġaginagich iñuich, naaggaunnii uŋiarrisaġinagich. "
7315,he must seek peace and pursue it. ,Christ iḷumutun Atanniuttusiuŋ iḷuvsiññiñ kamagiugaġlugu. Ataramik itqanaitchitchi kiggutiksravsiññik kialiqaa apiqsruqtuqpasi annaurrauyummativsigun. 
7316, For the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer. ,Kiummaġiksaaġumagisi piġuqtiŋaiġḷusi.

7317,But the Lord’s face is against those who do evil.,"Qanuq iłuałhaaqtuq nagliksaaġutigiruni nakuurualiqiniq piḷuusiqiniġmiñ, tainnainniqpan God-im pisuutaa. "
7318, For who is going to harm you if you are devoted to what is good? ,"Christ nagliksaaŋammiuq.

Ilaan timaa tuqutauŋagaluaqtuq ilitqusia iñuuruq-suli. "
7319," But in fact, if you happen to suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. But do not be terrified of them or be shaken. ",Aasii ilitqusiuvluni ilaan ullaŋagai ilitqutchich tigutaaġviŋmiittuat nagliksaaġviŋmi aasii alġaqsruqługich. 
7320, But set Christ apart as Lord in your hearts and always be ready to give an answer to anyone who asks about the hope you possess. ,"Tamatkua ilitqutchit ilitqusiġigaich taipkua iñuich kamaksriŋaitchuat God-mik Noah umiaqpipkaqługu, God-im utaqqiŋagaluaġai isumalitqiksiaġivlugich.

7321," Yet do it with courtesy and respect, keeping a good conscience, so that those who slander your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame when they accuse you. ","Taamna arrilisauruq paptaiġunmun paŋmapak annaurrautigikkavsiññun God-im tatavsautiksraŋaniñ.

7322," For it is better to suffer for doing good, if God wills it, than for doing evil.","Aasii paŋmapak Christ qiḷaŋmiittuq aquppivḷuni kamanaqsipkaqtauruam inaani taliqpiata tuŋaani, God-im atanniqsimavlugich iluqaisa isaġulgiḷḷu, qiḷaŋmiittuallu ataniġnaqutit, suaŋŋatillu."
7323," Because Christ also suffered once for sins, ",
7324,"the just for the unjust, ",
7325,"to bring you to God, ",
7326,by being put to death in the flesh ,
7327,but by being made alive in the spirit. ,
7328," In it he went and preached to the spirits in prison, ",
7329," after they were disobedient long ago when God patiently waited in the days of Noah as an ark was being constructed. In the ark a few, that is eight souls, were delivered through water. ",
7330," And this prefigured baptism, which now saves you – not the washing off of physical dirt but the pledge of a good conscience to God – through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, ",
7331, who went into heaven and is at the right hand of God with angels and authorities and powers subject to him.,
7332," So, since Christ suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same attitude, because the one who has suffered in the flesh has finished with sin, ","Tavra Christ nagliksaaqtuksrauŋamman timimiñi nalaunŋarualiqiniq pisigivlugu, ilaatun ilivsi isumaqaqtuksraummiusi, aasii itqanaiḷḷusi nagliksaaġutigiraksraġuqpan nalaunŋarualiqiniq.

7333, in that he spends the rest of his time on earth concerned about the will of God and not human desires. ,"aglaan aŋalatitaaliqsuq God-mun iñuuniqtutilaamisun, nunami aŋalatinŋaiqł̣uni piḷuksisuguuruamun iñuutchimiñun. "
7334," For the time that has passed was sufficient for you to do what the non-Christians desire. You lived then in debauchery, evil desires, drunkenness, carousing, drinking bouts, and wanton idolatries. ","Qaŋauvlugu qaaŋianiktuami aptatigianiŋagisi atuqługich ukpiŋaitchuat piḷḷatukkaŋich.

7335," So they are astonished when you do not rush with them into the same flood of wickedness, and they vilify you. ","Aasii paŋmapak ukpiŋaitchuat allasuktut iḷaliqsuutiŋaiqavsi ilimiŋnun pialapiaġataġniġmi, suurimmaanġiqł̣uniḷu iñuuniaġniġmi, aasii pisaaŋaaqsivḷusi. "
7336, They will face a reckoning before Jesus Christ who stands ready to judge the living and the dead. ,Taamna pisigilugu inmiŋnik uqaġiruksrauniaqtut God-mun isivġiisałhiñaaġuŋaruamun iñuuruanik tuquŋaruaniglu. 
7337," Now it was for this very purpose that the gospel was preached to those who are now dead, so that though they were judged in the flesh by human standards they may live spiritually by God’s standards.","Summan tusaayugaaġiksuaq alġaqsruutauŋava iñuuŋŋaisa paŋmapak tuquŋaruat?

7338, For the culmination of all things is near. So be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of prayer. ,Isuksraŋat supayaat qalliruq. Ilivsiññik aŋalalluataġitchi nipuŋaiḷḷusi aŋaiyyuyumiñaġumausi. 
7339," Above all keep your love for one another fervent, because love covers a multitude of sins. ","Naumaniqsrauruaq uvva, piviuttaqqutipiaġitchi avanmun qanuq piviuttaqqutiruni avanmun nalunaiqsimałhaiññaġnaitchut iluqaisa naġġunautit avanmun. "
7340, Show hospitality to one another without complaining. ,Tukkuliqsuutisitchi avanmun uqaallatigiŋaiġḷugu. 
7341," Just as each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another as good stewards of the varied grace of God. ","Iñullaam atuġligich inmigun aitchuusiallaani God-miñ ikayuutigisaġlugich allanun iñuŋnun. Tainna pigumi, aŋalatchiriḷḷuatauniaqtuq allakaaġiiñik God-im aitchuutiŋiñik inmiñun. "
7342," Whoever speaks, let it be with God’s words. Whoever serves, do so with the strength that God supplies, so that in everything God will be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.","Kiñaliqaa alġaqsruiruaq alġaqsruutiqaqtuksrauruq God-im uqaluanik.

7343," Dear friends, do not be astonished that a trial by fire is occurring among you, as though something strange were happening to you. ","Piviuttaġirauruasii, ukpiġurri uuktuaqtaumman nagliksaaqtitauvlusi, tupautiginagu isumavsiññi allayuaġilugu taamna piruaq ilivsiññun. "
7344," But rejoice in the degree that you have shared in the sufferings of Christ, so that when his glory is revealed you may also rejoice and be glad. ","Aglaan quviasuksiññaġitchi piqasiutiniḷusi Christ-mun nagliksaaġutiŋigun, taimanigu quviasupiaġataġumausi Christ niptaqpan qaumaniqaġluni. "
7345," If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory, who is the Spirit of God, rests on you. ","Quviasugitchi pisaaŋŋasiaqaġuvsi pisigilugu ukpiqtuaguniqsi Christ-mun, qanuq tainna pikpasi, sivuniqaqtuq God-im Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa qaiŋatilaaŋanik iḷuvsiññun salapqiiḷḷaruaq ilaan qaumanġanik. "
7346, But let none of you suffer as a murderer or thief or criminal or as a troublemaker. ,"Aglaan nalliqsiunni nagliksaalaqsruġnani iñuaġluni, naagga tigligluni, naagga pitquranik kipuqłaiḷuni, naagga iḷaksiatiluni iñuich allat piraŋiññun. "
7347," But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but glorify God that you bear such a name. ","Aglaattauq nagliksaaqtitauguvsi pisigilugu Christ-miuguniqsi, kanŋusuutiginagu. Quyyavigigiññaqsiuŋ God iḷisimanaqavsi Christ-mun iñugitilaavsiññik."
7348," For it is time for judgment to begin, starting with the house of God. And if it starts with us, what will be the fate of those who are disobedient to the gospel of God? ","Isivġiqsausaġviksraq tikitchuq, aasii God-im nanmiñiq iñuŋi isivġiqsauqqaaqtuksraurut.

7349," And if the righteous are barely saved, what will become of the ungodly and sinners? ","Bible uqaluqaqtut inna,"
7350, So then let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator as they do good.,
7351," From Simeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ, have been granted a faith just as precious as ours. ","Simon Peter, kivgaŋa tiliŋaraŋalu Jesus Christ, tuyuqtuq ukuniŋa iñuŋnun ukpiġutiniŋaruanun piqpaŋnaqtuamik uvaptiktuttauq, nalaunŋasipkaqtiqaŋaruanun God-mik Ataniptiŋniglu Jesus Christ-mik. "
7352, May grace and peace be lavished on you as you grow in the rich knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord!,"Nagliktuusiaqpaqaġitchisuq tutqiunmiglu iḷitchuġiŋalugu God, Ataniqpullu Jesus."
7353, I can pray this because his divine power has bestowed on us everything necessary for life and godliness through the rich knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence. ,"Ilaan qiḷaŋmiŋŋaqtauruam suaŋŋataata ikayuġaatigut supayaakun iñuutquvluta god-iliqiruaguluta, iḷitchuġigupta taavrumiŋa ququaqtiptiŋnik iḷaŋiutitquvluta ilaan kamanaunmiñun nakuunmiñullu. "
7354," Through these things he has bestowed on us his precious and most magnificent promises, so that by means of what was promised you may become partakers of the divine nature, after escaping the worldly corruption that is produced by evil desire. ","Suli ilaan suaŋŋanmigun unniqsuqłiiŋaruq piqpaŋnapiaġataqtuanik kamanapiaġataqtuaniglu unniqsuqłiisinik, aasii ukpiġiguvsigik tamatkua unniqsuqłiisiŋi nalaunniaŋitkiksi maquliñiksraq, pipkaġuukkaŋat iñuusiġiruni pigiitchuat kipiġniuġutit iluqaiññi nunam iñuŋiñi, aasii piqataullasivḷusi God-im iñuusianun, ilaatun iḷivḷusi.

7355," For this very reason, make every effort to add to your faith excellence, to excellence, knowledge; ","Tamatkua pisigilugich pisuqtilaavsisun nakuuniaġitchi taamna iḷḷatigilugu ukpiġutivsiññun, suli nakuuniaġnivsiññun iḷḷatigilugu iḷitchuġimmaġiksaaġniq God-mik, "

7360," Therefore, brothers and sisters, make every effort to be sure of your calling and election. For by doing this you will never stumble into sin. ","Aniqatiitkaa, tamatkua tainna inmata pisuqtilaavsisun iñuusitchi, ukpiġnaqsisaġlugu God-mun ququaŋatilaaqsi piksraqtaaġiŋatilaaqsiḷu. Aasii tainna iñuuguvsi, nalupqinaitchuq annaurrauniaqtusi. "

7362," Therefore, I intend to remind you constantly of these things even though you know them and are well established in the truth that you now have. ","Tavraasii piyummatigigiga ataramik itqautisukłusi tamatkuniŋa, iḷisimaluġisiunnii aunniuġusimalluataqługulu God-im iḷumun ittuaŋa pigikkaqsi. "
7363," Indeed, as long as I am in this tabernacle, I consider it right to stir you up by way of a reminder, ",Nalaunŋaruaġigiga iñuuniqtutilaaptun itqaqtitaġukłusi tamatkuniŋa piyumasaaġlusi. 
7364," since I know that my tabernacle will soon be removed, because our Lord Jesus Christ revealed this to me. ","Qanuq iḷisimaruŋa qimakkumaaqtilaaŋanik una tuquyumaaqtuaq timi, tainna Atanipta Jesus Christ nalupqinaiqł̣ugu uqallautiŋavluŋa. "
7365," Indeed, I will also make every effort that, after my departure, you have a testimony of these things.",Aglaan tuquŋaiñŋaġma piiguiyumiñaiġñiḷuŋniaġivsi itqaumayumiñaqsiḷusi tamatkuniŋa ataramik.
7366," For we did not follow cleverly concocted fables when we made known to you the power and return of our Lord Jesus Christ; no, we were eyewitnesses of his grandeur. ",Qanuq uvagut unipkaaligiññaġluta quliaqtuaġutiŋaitkivsi iḷitchuġipkaqsaqavsi suaŋŋataanik Atanipta Jesus Christ qaitqigñiksraŋaniglu. Uvagut tautupiaġataŋagikput kamanaqtuaq qaumaniŋa. 
7367," For he received honor and glory from God the Father, when that voice was conveyed to him by the Majestic Glory: “This is my dear Son, in whom I am delighted.” ","Nayuŋagikput kamanaqsipkaqtaumman, nanġaġmagulu God-im Aapam, taavruma nipim nivliutimmagu kamanaġniqsrauruam supayaaniñ uqallakłuni, “Uvva uvaŋa nanmiñiq Iġñiġa, iviġaummatigilluatakkaġa.” "
7368," When this voice was conveyed from heaven, we ourselves heard it, for we were with him on the holy mountain. ","Uvagut tusaaŋagikput taamna nipi nivliqsuaq qiḷaŋmiñ, itqatigiŋavlugu Jesus iġġimi God-im salapqiġmagu kamanautini."
7369," Moreover, we possess the prophetic word as an altogether reliable thing. You do well if you pay attention to this as you would to a light shining in a murky place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts. ","Taamna pisigilugu nalupqigiŋaimmaġiksaagaksraġigivut iḷumun itilaaŋat uqaluich aglaaŋich God-im uqaqtiŋisa Bible-ni.

7370," Above all, you do well if you recognize this: No prophecy of scripture ever comes about by the prophet’s own imagination, ","Supayaamiñ uvva itqaumaraksraqsi. Iñuum kialiqaa inmisuġruiññaq sivunniuġumiñaitkai nallipayaaŋich God-im uqaluŋisa Bible-niittuat, "

7372," But false prophets arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. These false teachers will infiltrate your midst with destructive heresies, even to the point of denying the Master who bought them. As a result, they will bring swift destruction on themselves.

7375," For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but threw them into hell and locked them up in chains in utter darkness, to be kept until the judgment, ","Qanuq taipkua isaġulgich piḷuksimmata, God-im tatavsaŋagai igiłługich nagliksaaġviŋmun, qiḷiqsruivḷugich tigutaaġutinik taaqtuami, tikitchiaġivlugu isivġiġvik uvluq. "
7376," and if he did not spare the ancient world, but did protect Noah, a herald of righteousness, along with seven others, when God brought a flood on an ungodly world, ","Suli God-im tatavsaŋagai iñuich piḷuktuat iñuuruat taimani, kamanaqtuamun uliqpaŋmun ipipkaqługich.

7377," and if he turned to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah when he condemned them to destruction, having appointed them to serve as an example to future generations of the ungodly, ","God-ivsuli suksraunġiŋagai iluqaisa iñuich iñuuruat iniqpaaŋni Sodom-miḷu Gomorrah-miḷu, suksraunġiqł̣ugich igniġmik.

7378," and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man in anguish over the debauched lifestyle of lawless men, ","God-im iñuuliŋagaa Lot nalaunŋaruaq iñuk, naġġukkutiqaŋaruaq allatuutikun piḷġusiŋiññun pitquraiḷaqtuat iñuich. "

7387," By forsaking the right path they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness, ","Taamna Balaam suaktauŋaruq kamaksriŋiññami, qanuq kakaktaan uqalaitchuam niġrutim nivliutivlugu iñuum nipaatun nutqaqtinŋagaa Balaam kinniqisaġaluaqtuaq."

"
7391," Although these false teachers promise such people freedom, they themselves are enslaved to immorality. For whatever a person succumbs to, to that he is enslaved.

"
7392," For if after they have escaped the filthy things of the world through the rich knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they again get entangled in them and succumb to them, their last state has become worse for them than their first.

7398, Thus we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.,Aasii tuyuutigigikput taamna quviasuutikput naamatquvlugu.
7399," Now this is the gospel message we have heard from him and announce to you: God is light, and in him there is no darkness at all. ","Uvva uqaluk uvagut tusaaŋakkaqput Iġñiŋaniñ aasii quliaqtuaġigikput ilivsiññun, God qaummataunivḷugu suli ilaani taaqtuagitchuq suuramikunnii. "
7400," If we say we have fellowship with him and yet keep on walking in the darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth. ","Uqaġupta piqaġniḷuta iḷammiuġunmik ilaanun iñuuniaqtuiññallapta piḷuunmi taaqtuamiinmatun, saglurugut, suli iñuuŋitchugut nalaullugu iḷumun ittuaq. "
7401," But if we walk in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin. ","Aglaan iñuuniaqtuagugupta qaummaġmi, ilaatun qaummaġmiittuatun, piqaqtugut iḷammiuġunmik avanmun, suli auŋata Jesus ilaan Iġñiŋan salummaqsimaaġaatigut piḷuutipayaaniñ."

7403," But if we confess our sins, he is faithful and righteous, forgiving us our sins and cleansing us from all unrighteousness.

7404," If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar and his word is not in us. ","Uqaġupta piḷuksiŋaiññiḷuta, God saglurualigikput, suli uqalua ukpiġiŋitkikput."
7405," (My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin.) But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous One, ","Miqłiqtuuratkaa, tuyuġivsi taapkuniŋa piḷuksitquŋił̣ł̣usi. Aglaan kiñapayaaq piḷuksiñiqpan, qiññuaqtuurriqaqtugut Aapamun, Jesus Christ-mik nalaunŋaruamik. "
7406," and he himself is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for our sins but also for the whole world.","Aasii God-im suliqutigiŋaiġumiñaġai itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich piḷuutivut pisigilugu Christ inuaŋaitchuaguvluni akiḷiutauŋaruaq piḷuutiptiŋnun tuqukami.

7407, Now by this we know that we have come to know God: if we keep his commandments. ,"Aasii kamagiguptigik God-im pitquraŋi, nalupqisukkumiñaitchugut iḷisimatilaaptiŋnik ilaanik. "
7408," The one who says “I have come to know God” and yet does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in such a person. ","Iñuk uqaqtuaq iḷisimaniḷugu God aasii kamaksriŋił̣ł̣uni pitquraŋiñik sagluruaguruq, suli God-im iḷumun ittuaŋa ukpiġiŋitkaa. "
7409," But whoever obeys his word, truly in this person the love of God has been perfected. By this we know that we are in him. ","Aglaan kialiqaa kamagituiññaqpagich God-im uqaluŋi ilaan piviuttaġipiallakkaa God, aasii tainnainman nalupqisukkumiñaitchugut iñuutilaaptiŋnik ilaa atausiŋŋuqatigimaaqługu. "

7412," On the other hand, I am writing a new commandment to you which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining. ","Aasiivsauq pitquraq tuyuutigikkaġa ilivsiññun nutaummiuq, suli iḷisimanaqtuq God-mun iḷumun ittuaġitilaaŋanik Christ iñuusiagun, ilivsiḷuami iñuusivsigun.

7415," But the one who hates his fellow Christian is in the darkness, walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.","Aglaan iñuk uumikłiqsuaq aniqanmiñik taaqtuamiittuq, suli pisuaqtuq taaġmi, suli naluruq sumun iglautilaamiñik, qanuq taaqtuam tautuksipkalaitkaa."
7416," I am writing to you, little children, that your sins have been forgiven because of his name. ","Miqłiqtuuraat, tuyuġivsi qanuq piḷuutisi suliqutigiŋaiqsaurut itqaumayumiñaiqł̣ugich pisigivlugu Christ piraŋa. "

7418," I have written to you, children, that you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, that you have known him who has been from the beginning. I have written to you, young people, that you are strong, and the word of God resides in you, and you have conquered the evil one.","Miqłiqtuut, tuyuŋagivsi qanuq iḷisimagiksi Aapa.

7419," Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him, ","Piviuttaġinagu suuramikunnii nunam iñuŋisa piḷġusiat. Kialiqaa piviuttaġikpagu nunam iñuŋisa piḷġusiat, piviuttaġiŋitkaa Aapa. "
7420," because all that is in the world (the desire of the flesh and the desire of the eyes and the arrogance produced by material possessions) is not from the Father, but is from the world. ","Qanuq supayaat nunam iñuŋisa piḷġusiġikkaŋich sut piḷuksisuguuruam timim kipiġniuttaġikkaŋi, sut iñuich qiñikkaŋich pigiyumavlugiḷḷu, suli supayaat mattumani nunamiittuat iñuich kamasaaġutigikkaŋich, nalliŋich unnii qaisauŋaitchut Aapamiñ.

7433," If you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered by him.",
7434, (See what sort of love the Father has given to us: that we should be called God’s children – and indeed we are! For this reason the world does not know us: because it did not know him. ,"Qanutun Aapam piviuttaġitigiŋaniġaatigut.

7439, Everyone who resides in him does not sin; everyone who sins has neither seen him nor known him. ,"Kiñaliqaa atausiŋŋuqatauŋaruaq Christ-mun piḷuusiqiugaŋitchuq, aasii iñuk piḷuusiqiugaqtuaq tautuŋaitchuq ilaanik, iḷitchuġiŋaitkaalu qaŋaunnii. "

7441," The one who practices sin is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was revealed: to destroy the works of the devil. ","Iñuk piḷuusiqiugaqtuaq Tuunġaum pigigaa, qanuq tuunġaq piḷuusiqiŋaruq aullaqisaamiñqaŋa. Iġñiŋa God-im salapqiŋaruq suksraunġiġukługich savaaŋi Tuunġaum."
7442," Everyone who has been fathered by God does not practice sin, because God’s seed resides in him, and thus he is not able to sin, because he has been fathered by God.

7443, By this the children of God and the children of the devil are revealed: Everyone who does not practice righteousness – the one who does not love his fellow Christian – is not of God.,"Uumuuna iḷisimanaġumiñaqtut kisut miqłiqtuġitilaaŋat God-mun, suli kisut miqłiqtuġitilaaŋat Tuunġaġmun.

7445," not like Cain who was of the evil one and brutally murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his deeds were evil, but his brother’s were righteous.",Ittuksrauŋitchugut Cain-tun pigiitchuamiñ piruatun iñuktaġivlugu aniqatini. Aasii summan iñuktaġiŋavauŋ?

7446," Therefore do not be surprised, brothers and sisters, if the world hates you. ","Aniqatiit, allayuaġnasi nunam iñuŋisa uumigikpasi. "
7447, We know that we have crossed over from death to life because we love our fellow Christians. The one who does not love remains in death. ,Piviuttaġiguptigik ukpiqtuaguqativut iḷisimanaqsigikput annaurrauŋatilaaqput tuqqunmiñ iñuullasivḷuta isuitchuamun.

7449, We have come to know love by this: that Jesus laid down his life for us; thus we ought to lay down our lives for our fellow Christians. ,"Iḷisimagikput piviuttaqqun uumuuna, Christ aitchuutigiŋagaa iñuggutini tuquvluni anniqsuqsaqłuta, uvaguttauq aitchuiruksraummiugut iñuggutiptiŋnik anniqsuqsaġlugich aniqatiivut. "
7450," But whoever has the world’s possessions and sees his fellow Christian in need and shuts off his compassion against him, how can the love of God reside in such a person?","Kiñaliqaa suġalliruaq aasii iḷitchuġivlugu aniqatini piiḷḷiuqtuaq, aasii nagliksrautaił̣ł̣uni ilaanun, pimaaqtuġumiñaitkaa God-im piviuttaqqutaa iḷumiñi inniḷugu.

7452," And by this we will know that we are of the truth and will convince our conscience in his presence, ","Tainna pigupta iḷisimaniaqtugut iḷumun ukpiqtuagutilaaptiŋnik, attaqsrautiqaġumiñaitchugullu God-im sivuġaani. "
7453," that if our conscience condemns us, that God is greater than our conscience and knows all things. ","Irrusiqaġaluaġuptaunnii pasikkunmik iḷuptiŋni attaqsraŋirrutiqaġumiñaqtugut ilaan sivuġaani, qanuq God kamanałhaaqtuq isumaptiŋni pasikkutiniñ, supayauramik iḷisimavluni uvaptigun. "

7455," and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do the things that are pleasing to him. ","aasii akuqtuisuurugut ilaaniñ supayaamik apiqsriaptiŋnik, qanuq kamagigivut pitquraŋi suli pivḷugu suna iviġaumanaqtuaq ilaanun. "
7456," Now this is his commandment: that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he gave us the commandment. ","Aasiuvva ilaan pitquraŋa, uvagut ukpiquvluta Iġñiġmiñun Jesus Christ-mun suli piviuttaqqutiluta avanmun, kamagilugu Christ pitqurriutaa uvaptiŋnun. "
7457," And the person who keeps his commandments resides in God, and God in him. Now by this we know that God resides in us: by the Spirit he has given us.","Iluqaġmiŋ kamaksriruat God-im pitquraŋiñik atausiŋŋuqatigimaaġaat God, suli God iñuuruq iliŋiññi. Suli uumuuna iḷisimarugut ilaan iñuutilaaŋanik uvaptiŋni, Ilitqusiġiksuaq iḷiŋavlugu ilaan iḷuptiŋnun."
7458," Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to determine if they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. ","Piviuttaġirauruasii, ukpiġinagu iñupayauraq pimaaqtuqtuaq Ilitqusiġiksuaqaġnivḷuni, aglaan naipiqtuqsigik iḷitchuġisaġlugich ilitqusiq pigikkaŋat God-miñ qaisilaaŋanik.

7459," By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses Jesus as the Christ who has come in the flesh is from God, ",Uumuuna iḷisimagiksi Ilitqusiġiksuaŋa God-im: Iñupayaaq quliaqtuaqaqtuaq Jesus Christ-mik qaiŋanivḷugu timiqaqłuni piqaqtuq Ilitqusiġiksuamik qairuamik God-miñ. 
7460," but every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God, and this is the spirit of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now is already in the world.","Aasii iñupayaaq quliaqtuaqaŋitchuaq Jesus-mik tainna, piqaŋitchuq Ilitqusiġiksuamik God-miñ.

7463," We are from God; the person who knows God listens to us, but whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.","Uvagut God-im pigigaatigut. Kiapayaaq iḷisimaruam God-mik naalaġnigaatigut, aasiiḷi kialiqaa God-im pigiŋisaŋan naalaġniŋitkaatigut.

7465," The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love. ","Iñuk piviuttaqqutaitchuaq naluruq God-mik, qanuq God piviuttaqqutauruq. "
7466, By this the love of God is revealed in us: that God has sent his one and only Son into the world so that we may live through him. ,"Innauvva piviuttaqqutaa God-im salapqiŋaruq akunnaptiŋni, God-im tilivḷugu Iġñitualuni nunamun, uvagut iñuutquvluta ilaagun. "
7467," In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.","Uvva innaittuq piviuttaqqun, piviuttaġiŋaitkaluaġikput God aglaan ilaan piviuttaġiŋaniġaatigut suli tilivḷugu Iġñini tuqutquvlugu ilaan suliqutigiŋaiġukługich itqaumayumiñaiġḷugich piḷuutivut.

7469," No one has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God resides in us, and his love is perfected in us. ","Iñuum qaŋaunnii tautuŋaitkaa God, aglaan piviuttaqqutigupta avanmun, God iñuuruq iḷuptiŋni piviuttaqqutaalu naamasiŋaruq iḷuptiŋni."
7470, By this we know that we reside in God and he in us: in that he has given us of his Spirit. ,"Uvva nalupqisuŋirrutiksraqput atausiŋŋuqatigiŋatilaaŋanik God suli ilaa iñuutilaaŋanik iḷuptiŋni, ilaan iḷiŋavlugu Ilitqusiġiksuani iḷuptiŋnun. "

7473," And we have come to know and to believe the love that God has in us. God is love, and the one who resides in love resides in God, and God resides in him. ","Tavraasii iḷisimagikput ukpiġigikpullu God-mun piviuttaġitilaaqput. God piviuttaqqutauruq, iñuk aasii piviuttaqsriruaq atausiŋŋuqatauruq God-mun, suli God iñuuruq iḷuani. "
7474," By this love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment, because just as Jesus is, so also are we in this world.

7475," There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out fear, because fear has to do with punishment. The one who fears punishment has not been perfected in love. ","Piviuttaqsrikapta God-im piviuttaqsrisiatun, ilaa sivuuġagiŋitkikput.

7476, We love because he loved us first.,Piviuttaqsrirugut qanuq God-im piviuttaġiqqaaŋagaatigut.

7478, And the commandment we have from him is this: that the one who loves God should love his fellow Christian too. ,"Aasiuvva pitquraksriusiaqput Christ-miñ, iñuuvguuq piviuttaġiniġumiuŋ God piviuttaġiraksraġimmigaa aniqatini."
7479," The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what must happen very soon. He made it clear by sending his angel to his servant John, ",Ukunani taiguani aglausimarut sut Jesus Christ salapqikkaŋi.

7491," I, John, your brother and the one who shares with you in the persecution, kingdom, and endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus. ","Nusaŋi qatiqtigiŋarut qatiqtuatun imnaim mitquatun, aputitullu. Irrak inŋaruk igniqtun ikualaruatun. "

7572,"Who was and who is, and who is still to come!”",
7573," And whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever, ",
7574," the twenty-four elders throw themselves to the ground before the one who sits on the throne and worship the one who lives forever and ever, and they offer their crowns before his throne, saying:",
7575," “You are worthy, our Lord and God,",
7576,"to receive glory and honor and power,",
7577,"since you created all things,",
7578,and because of your will they existed and were created!”,
7579, Then I saw in the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne a scroll written on the front and back and sealed with seven seals. ,"Tautuŋammiuŋa taliqpiani taavruma aquppiruam umialgum aquppiutaŋiñi immuanik makpiġaanik aglaqaqtuanik iḷumikkullu siḷatimikkullu, nipititaqtat tallimat malġugnik nipitirrutinik. "
7580, And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming in a loud voice: “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?” ,"Suli tautuŋammiuŋa sapiġñaqtuamik isaġuliŋmik nivliqsuamik nipatuvluni, Kiña nalliummativa qauqtiġumiñaqługich nipitirrutiŋich aŋmaġlugiḷḷu immuat makpiġaat? "
7581, But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or look into it. ,Tavraasii kiapayaaq qiḷaŋmi naagga nunami naaggaunnii nunam ataani aŋmaġumiñaiñŋaġaich immuat makpiġaat naaggaunnii taiguaġumiñaiññiġaich. 
7582, So I began weeping bitterly because no one was found who was worthy to open the scroll or to look into it. ,Tavra qiaŋaruŋa atqunaqłuŋa pisigivlugu iñuiññiġman nalliummatiruamik aŋmaġumiñaġlugich immuat makpiġaat naaggaunnii taiguaġumiñaġlugich. 
7583," Then one of the elders said to me, “Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered; thus he can open the scroll and its seven seals.”","Tavrani iḷaŋata umialiŋnat uqallautiŋagaaŋa, Qianak. Uvva iñuum suaŋŋatiqpaqaqtuam Lion-tun, maŋŋuqaqtuaq Judah-miñ, kiŋunġuruaq David-mun, akimaŋaruq aŋmaġumiñaqsivḷugiḷḷu immuat makpiġaat, piiġumiñaqsivḷugiḷḷu tallimat malġuk nipirrutiŋich."
7584," Then I saw standing in the middle of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the middle of the elders, a Lamb that appeared to have been killed. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth. ","Aasii akunġanni umialgum aquppiutaŋisa sisamallu uumaruat savaat umialiŋnallu, tautuŋagiga Imnaiyaaq makitaruaq, qiññaqaqłuni tuqutauŋaruatun, tallimat malġugnik nagruqaqłuni suli tallimat malġugnik iriqaqłuni, taapkua sunauvva tallimat malġuk ilitqusiŋi God-im tilirauŋaruat iluqaanun nunamun. "
7585," Then he came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne, ",Tavra imnaiyaaq ullautiŋaruq aasii tiguvlugich immuat makpiġaat taliqpianiñ aquppiruam umialgum aquppiutaŋiñi. 
7586," and when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders threw themselves to the ground before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense (which are the prayers of the saints). ","Tavraasii tiguaniŋmagich immuat makpiġaat, sisamat iñuuruat savaat iñuiññaq sisamallu umialiŋnat punŋarut sivuġaanun Imnaiyaam.

7587, They were singing a new song:,"Aasii atuŋarut atuutitchiamik inna,"
7588,“You are worthy to take the scroll,
7589,and to open its seals,
7590,"because you were killed, ",
7591,and at the cost of your own blood you have purchased for God ,
7592,"persons from every tribe, language, people, and nation.",
7593," You have appointed them as a kingdom and priests to serve our God, and they will reign on the earth.”",
7594," Then I looked and heard the voice of many angels in a circle around the throne, as well as the living creatures and the elders. Their number was ten thousand times ten thousand – thousands times thousands – ",
7595, all of whom were singing in a loud voice:,
7596,“Worthy is the lamb who was killed ,
7597,to receive power and wealth ,
7598,and wisdom and might ,
7599,and honor and glory and praise!”,
7600," Then I heard every creature – in heaven, on earth, under the earth, in the sea, and all that is in them – singing:",
7601,“To the one seated on the throne and to the Lamb,
7602,"be praise, honor, glory, and ruling power forever and ever!”",
7603," And the four living creatures were saying “Amen,” and the elders threw themselves to the ground and worshiped.",
7604," I looked on when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying with a thunderous voice, “Come!” ","Tavra takunnaqtilluŋa imnaiyaaq aŋmaisaġman iḷaŋannik nipitirrutit tallimat malġuuruat, tusaaŋaruŋa iḷaŋannik sisamauruat uumaruat savaat uqallaktuamik nipiqaqłuni kallularuatun, Qaġġiiñ. "
7605," So I looked, and here came a white horse! The one who rode it had a bow, and he was given a crown, and as a conqueror he rode out to conquer.","Tavraasii tautuŋagiga qatiqtuaq tuttuqpak suli kakaksiqsuaq pisiksiqaŋaruq, aitchuusiaqaqłuni niaquġunmik. Ilaa aullaŋaruq akimasautigillaġmi akimayaqtuqsaqłuniḷu. "
7606," Then when the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!” ","Tavra Imnaiyaam aŋmalgiñmagu igḷua nipitirrutim, tusaalgitchuŋa igḷuanik uumaruam savaam uqallaktuamik, Qaġġiiñ. "
7607," And another horse, fiery red, came out, and the one who rode it was granted permission to take peace from the earth, so that people would butcher one another, and he was given a huge sword.","Allasuli tuttuqpak salapqiŋaruq kaviqsuaq. Taamna kakaksiqsuaq suaŋŋasiqsauŋaruq aŋuyakkumiñaqsivḷugich iñuich nunami, avanmun tuquġautitquvlugich, suli aitchuusiaqaŋaruq savikpakpaŋmik."
7608," Then when the Lamb opened the third seal I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” So I looked, and here came a black horse! The one who rode it had a balance scale in his hand. ","Imnaiyaam aŋmalgiñmagu piŋayuak nipitirrutik, tusaaŋagiga piŋayuak uumaruak savaak uqallaktuaq, Qaġġiiñ. Tavra tautulgitkiga maŋaqtaaq tuttuqpak, suli kakaksiqsiŋa saagaġniqsuaq uqumaisilaaġutiŋnik. "
7609," Then I heard something like a voice from among the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat will cost a day’s pay and three quarts of barley will cost a day’s pay. But do not damage the olive oil and the wine!”","Tavra tusaalgitchuŋa nivliqpalliqsuamik iġiñamik akunġanniñ sisamat uumaruat savaat uqallaktuamik, Akutchiñiq palauvak sivuniqaġli uvlupak savaŋniġmun akiññaktaamun, suli piŋasuni akutchiñiq barley palauvak uvlupak savaŋniġmun akiññaktaaguli, aglaan qanuq piññagu uqsruq, wine-lu."
7610," Then when the Lamb opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come!” ","Tavra Imnaiyaam aŋmaġmagu sisamaŋat nipitirrutit, tusaaŋaruŋa nipaanik sisamaŋata uumaruat savaat uqallaktuamik, Qaġġiiñ. "
7611," So I looked and here came a pale green horse! The name of the one who rode it was Death, and Hades followed right behind. They were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill its population with the sword, famine, and disease, and by the wild animals of the earth.","Tavra tautulgitkiga misuitchuatun qiññalik tuttuqpak, kakaksiqsuaŋa atiqaġniqsuq Tuqqunmik, suli Nagliksaaġvium maliġuaŋagaa.

7612," Now when the Lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been violently killed because of the word of God and because of the testimony they had given. ","Tavra Imnaiyaam aŋmaġmagu tallimaŋat nipitirrutit, tautuŋagitka ataani ikipkaivium ilitqusiŋich iñuich iñuktauŋaruat pisigivlugu uqalua God-im, suli pisigivlugu ukpiġnaqsivḷugu quliaqtuaġiniŋa tusaayugaaġiksuam. "
7613," They cried out with a loud voice, “How long, Sovereign Master, holy and true, before you judge those who live on the earth and avenge our blood?” ","Iliŋich nipanŋarut nipatuvlutiŋ, Ataniiq, sapiġñaqtuatiin, piḷuutaitchuatiin iḷumun ittuaġlu, qanutun sivisutigiruamik isivġiġñiaŋitpigich iñuŋi nunam aasii tatavsaġlugich pisigilugu tuqunŋammatigut? "
7614," Each of them was given a long white robe and they were told to rest for a little longer, until the full number was reached of both their fellow servants and their brothers who were going to be killed just as they had been.","Tavra iliŋich aitchuusiaqallaaŋarut qatiqtuanik akuqturuanik annuġaanik aasii uqallautivlugich piḷaiŋaiqsiallavsaaquvlugich, iñugiaktilaaksrautaat kivgauqatiŋisa aniqatiimiglu naatchiaġilugu, tuqutauyumaaġmiruat iliŋisituttauq."
7615," Then I looked when the Lamb opened the sixth seal, and a huge earthquake took place; the sun became as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon became blood red; ","Tavra Imnaiyaam aŋmaġmagu itchaksraŋat nipitirrutit qiñilgitchuŋa. Tavra nuna aulaqparraqsiŋaruq, siqiñiq taaqsimmivḷuni maŋaqtuatun ukił̣haatun, suli naaqiŋaruaq tatqiq kaviqsivḷuni auktun. "
7616, and the stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree dropping its unripe figs when shaken by a fierce wind. ,Suli uvluġiat qiḷaŋmi kataŋarut nunamun fig napaaqtua kataiqpaŋmatun naaqiŋaitchuanik siiġñiamiñik aŋalayyauġmani anuġiqpaum. 
7617," The sky was split apart like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place. ","Qiḷak tautuŋnaiŋammiuq immuatun makpiġaatun imummatigik, iġġipayaat suli qikiqtallu nuutauŋarut inimiŋniñ. "
7618," Then the kings of the earth, the very important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. ","Tavrani umialiŋi nunam atanaurallu qaukłiŋiḷḷu aŋuyaktit suġalliruallu sapiġñaqtuallu iñupayaurallu kivgakkaluat atanġitchuallu, iriqtuŋarut qaiġusuŋnun akunġannullu uyaġagruaŋisa iġġich, "
7619," They said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb, ","ququulavlutiŋ iġġiñun uyaġagruanullu, Kattaqisigut aasii iriġluta irraŋniñ, taavruma aquppiruam umialgum aquppiutaŋiñi, suli qinnautaaniñ Imnaiyaam. "
7620," because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to withstand it?”","Qanuq kamanaqtuaq uvlua tatavsautaata tikitchuq, aasii kiñaliqaa igḷutuutiyumiñaipiallaktuq taavrumuŋa."
7621," After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth so no wind could blow on the earth, on the sea, or on any tree. ","Taavruma aquagun uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa sisamanik isaġuliŋnik makitaruanik sisamani kaŋiġalluŋiñi nunam, aullaqtaiḷiññiktuanik sisamanik anuġiŋiñik nunam, anuġi anuqłiquŋił̣ł̣ugu sumikunnii nunamun naaggaunnii taġiumun naaggaunnii napaaqtupayaanun. "
7622," Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, who had the seal of the living God. He shouted out with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given permission to damage the earth and the sea: ","Tavrani tautuŋammiuŋa allamik isaġuliŋmik qunmuktuamik nuisaġataġniŋaniñ siqiñġum, saagaqłuni nalunaiñŋutchiutaanik iñuuruam God-im, aasii ilaa ququulaŋaruq nipatuvluni sisamanun isaġuliŋnun aitchuusiaqaŋaruanun suaŋŋanmik maqutchumiñaqsivḷugu nuna taġiuġlu, "
7623, “Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have put a seal on the foreheads of the servants of our God.” ,"uqaqłuni, Maqunnagu nuna taġiuġlu napaaqtullu, uvagut nalunaiñŋutchiigaluaqtinnata kivgaŋiñik God-ipta qauŋisigun. "
7624," Now I heard the number of those who were marked with the seal, one hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from all the tribes of the people of Israel:","Tavra tusaaŋagiga iñugiaktilaaŋat nalunaiñŋutchiqsauruat God-im nalunaiñŋutchiutaanik, maŋŋupayaaŋiññiñ iñuŋniñ Israel-guruaniñ.

7625," From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand were sealed,","Nalunaiñŋutchiqsauruat maŋŋuqaqtuat Judah-mik 12,000, maŋŋuqaqtuat Reuben-mik 12,000, maŋŋuqaqtuat Gad-mik 12,000, "

7637," After these things I looked, and here was an enormous crowd that no one could count, made up of persons from every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb dressed in long white robes, and with palm branches in their hands. ","qanuq Imnaiyaaq qitqanniittuaq umialgum aquppiutaŋisa qaunaksriginiaġaat imnaiḷiqirisun, suli ilaan aullatiniaġai imiġnun iñuunaqtuanun, suli God-im qulvipayaat piiġñiaġai iriŋiññiñ."
7638," They were shouting out in a loud voice,",
7639,"“Salvation belongs to our God,",
7640,"to the one seated on the throne, and to the Lamb!”",
7641," And all the angels stood there in a circle around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they threw themselves down with their faces to the ground before the throne and worshiped God, ",
7642," saying,",
7643,"“Amen! Praise and glory, ",
7644,"and wisdom and thanksgiving, ",
7645,and honor and power and strength ,
7646,be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!”,
7647," Then one of the elders asked me, “These dressed in long white robes – who are they and where have they come from?” ",
7648," So I said to him, “My lord, you know the answer.” Then he said to me, “These are the ones who have come out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb! ",
7649," For this reason they are before the throne of God, and they serve him day and night in his temple, and the one seated on the throne will shelter them. ",
7650," They will never go hungry or be thirsty again, and the sun will not beat down on them, nor any burning heat, ",
7651," because the Lamb in the middle of the throne will shepherd them and lead them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”",
7652, Now when the Lamb opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. ,"Tavra Imnaiyaam aŋmaġmagu tallimat malġuat nipitirrutit, nipaiġruummiŋarut qiḷaŋmi kaivallagniġum avvasuŋnaŋani. "
7653," Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them. ","Tavraami uvaŋa John tautuŋagitka tallimat malġuk isaġulgich makitaruat sivuġaani God-im, suli tallimat malġugnik nipauqłuktautinik aitchuusiaqaŋarut. "
7654," Another angel holding a golden censer came and was stationed at the altar. A large amount of incense was given to him to offer up, with the prayers of all the saints, on the golden altar that is before the throne. ","Suli allaptauq isaġulik qaivḷuni makinŋaruq ikipkaiviŋmi kaviqsuamiñ maniŋmiñ tivraġiksautiqaġviŋmik saagaqłuni, suli aitchuusiaqaŋaruq atqunaqługu tivraġiksaunmik avvutigitquvlugu aŋaiyyutaannun God-im iñuŋisa, naavitquvlugu manium kaviqsuam ikipkaivium qaaŋani sivuġaani umialgum aquppiutaŋata. "
7655," The smoke coming from the incense, along with the prayers of the saints, ascended before God from the angel’s hand. ",Tavra avyua tivraġiksautim qunmuŋaruq piqasiqł̣uni aŋaiyyutiŋiññik God-im iñuŋisa isaġulgum naavitaŋa ikipkaiviŋmun sivuġaani God-im. 
7656," Then the angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth, and there were crashes of thunder, roaring, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.","Tavraasii isaġulgum tiguŋagaa tivraġiksautiqaġvik aasii immiqł̣ugu igniġmik ikipkaiviŋmiñ, aasii miḷuqsautivlugu nunamun.

7657, Now the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.,Tavra tallimat malġuk isaġulgich tallimat malġugnik nipauqłuktautiqaqtuat itqanaiġutiŋagaich nipauqłuktaqsaġumavlutiŋ. 
7658," The first angel blew his trumpet, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was thrown at the earth so that a third of the earth was burned up, a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.","Sivulliq isaġulik nipauqłuktaŋaruq.

7659," Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain of burning fire was thrown into the sea. A third of the sea became blood, ",Igḷua isaġulgum nipauqłuktaŋammiuq. Tavraasii sunakiaq iġġiqpaktun ittuaq ikualavluni igniġmik igitauŋaruq taġiumun. 
7660," and a third of the creatures living in the sea died, and a third of the ships were completely destroyed.","Suli piŋayuigułługu taġiuq piŋayuak auguŋaruq, piŋayuiŋich uumaruurat niġrutit taġiumi tuquŋarut, suli piŋayuiŋich umiaqpapayaurat suksraunġiqsauvlutiŋ."
7661," Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and a huge star burning like a torch fell from the sky; it landed on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water. ","Piŋayuak isaġullak nipauqłuktalgitchuq. Tavra uvluġiaqpak kataŋaruq qiḷaŋmiñ, ikualaruatun naniġuatun, aasii kattaqivlugich piŋayuiŋich kuugich maqsraluktuallu imġich. "
7662," (Now the name of the star is Wormwood.) So a third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from these waters because they were poisoned.","Atiŋa uvluġiam Tivluktuaq. Piŋayuiŋich imġich tivluksiŋarut, aasii iñugiaktuat iñuich tuquŋarut imiqłutiŋ, qanuq tivluksipkaqtauŋaruq imiq. "
7663," Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened. And there was no light for a third of the day and for a third of the night likewise. ","Sisamaŋat isaġulgich nipauqłuktaŋaruq. Aasii iḷaŋa siqiñġum taaqsiŋaruq.

7664," Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying directly overhead, proclaiming with a loud voice, “Woe! Woe! Woe to those who live on the earth because of the remaining sounds of the trumpets of the three angels who are about to blow them!”","Tavrani uvaŋa John qiviaŋaruŋa, tusaavluguasii tiŋmiaqpak tiŋmiruaq qutchikł̣uni siḷami nipattuaq nipatuvluni, Iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpak, iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpak.

7665," Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen from the sky to the earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the abyss. ","Tavra tallimaŋat isaġulgich nipauqłuktaŋaruq, aasii tautuŋagiga uvluġiaq kataktuaq qiḷaŋmiñ nunamun, aasii ilaa aitchuusiaqaŋaruq pitchiġiiyautaanik mitaiḷam putum. "
7666, He opened the shaft of the abyss and smoke rose out of it like smoke from a giant furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with smoke from the shaft. ,"Uvluġiam aŋmaŋagaa mitaiḷaq putu, tavraŋŋa isiq mayurraqsiŋaruq puyuatun kamanaqtuam igniġum, suli siqiñiq siḷalu taaqsiŋagik itchim putumiñ mitaiḷamiñ.

7667," Then out of the smoke came locusts onto the earth, and they were given power like that of the scorpions of the earth. ","Tavrani itchimiñ salapqiŋarut nuttagayuich nunam qaaŋanun, aasii suaŋŋasiqsauŋarut ittuamik suaŋŋataatun igutchaqpaŋisa kapputilgich nunam. "
7668," They were told not to damage the grass of the earth, or any green plant or tree, but only those people who did not have the seal of God on their forehead. ","Iliŋich uqallausiaqaŋarut maqutchitquŋił̣ł̣ugich iviŋiñik nunam naaggaunnii qanusipayaanik suŋaaqtuanik nauruanik napaaqtupayaaniglu, aglaatualuk tamatkuniŋa iñulimaanik nalunaiñŋutaitchuanik nalunaiñŋutchiutaanik God-im qauŋisigun. "
7669," The locusts were not given permission to kill them, but only to torture them for five months, and their torture was like that of a scorpion when it stings a person. ","Tamatkua nuttagayuich nagliksaaqtitchipkaqtauŋarut iñuŋnik tallimani tatqiñi, aglaan tuqunŋisiññaġlugich. Aasii kiiqsiuġniŋat kapputiŋisa inŋarut nagliksaaġnaġniŋatun kapputaata igutchaqpaum. "
7670," In those days people will seek death, but will not be able to find it; they will long to die, but death will flee from them.",Tavraasii taipkunani tallimani tatqiñi iñuich tuquyumałhaaġniaġaluaqtut tuquyumiñaiññiaqtut. Kiiqsiuqpaił̣ł̣utiŋ kipiġniuġniaġaluaqtut tuqusuglutiŋ.
7671," Now the locusts looked like horses equipped for battle. On their heads were something like crowns similar to gold, and their faces looked like men’s faces. ","Nuttagayuich qiññaqaŋarut tuttuqpaktun aŋuyagumiññaqsaaŋaruatun. Niaquŋiññi inŋammiut qiññaqaqtuat niaquġutitun savaaguruatun maniŋmiñ kaviqsuamiñ, suli kiiñaqaqłutiŋ iñuktun. "
7672," They had hair like women’s hair, and their teeth were like lions’ teeth. ","Mitquŋich ilaaptauġmakua aġnat nuyaŋich, aasii kigutiŋich lion kigutiŋisitun. "
7673," They had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings was like the noise of many horse-drawn chariots charging into battle. ",Satqaŋich matuqaŋarut qiññaqaqtuanik savił̣hatun satqagutitun. Suli sukpaluat isaġuŋisa inŋarut tuttuqpirautitun aksraliktuatun sukpaluktaġmata tuttuqpaich paŋalgutimmatigik aŋuyaktuanun. 
7674," They have tails and stingers like scorpions, and their ability to injure people for five months is in their tails. ",Tamatkua nuttagayuich pamiuqaŋarut igutchaqpaktun kapputiliktun suli kavluivḷutiŋ. Suli suaŋŋatiqaŋarut anniaqłiqł̣utiŋ pamiumiŋnik iñuŋnik tallimani tatqiñi. 
7675," They have as king over them the angel of the abyss, whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon.","Umialiqaŋarut atanniqsimarimiŋnik isaġuliŋnik aŋalatchiruamik mitaiḷamik putumik. Ilaan atqa Jew-guruat uqausiatigun Abbadon, aasiiḷi Greek-gich taggisiqaġaat Apollyon, sivuniŋa Maqutchiri."
7676," The first woe has passed, but two woes are still coming after these things!","Sivulliq iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpak qaaŋianiktuq. Uvva, malġuk iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaak qaiyumaaqtuk suli taavruma aquagun. "
7677," Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a single voice coming from the horns on the golden altar that is before God, ",Tavrani itchaksraŋat isaġulgich nipauqłuktaŋaruq. Aasii tusaaŋaruŋa nivliksuamik kaŋiġalluŋiñiñ kaviqsuamiñ maniŋmiñ ikipkaivium God-im sivuġaaniittuam. 
7678," saying to the sixth angel, the one holding the trumpet, “Set free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!” ","Uqallaktuamik itchaksraŋannun isaġulgich nipauqłuktautiliŋmun, Pituikkich sisamat isaġulgich pituksimaruat kamanaqtuami kuuŋmi Euphrates-mi. "
7679," Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour, day, month, and year were set free to kill a third of humanity. ","Tavra sisamat isaġulgich pituiqsauŋarut, tigummirauruat itqanaiqsimmativlugich ikarramun, uvlumun, tatqimun, ukiumullu, tuqutchiruksrautauvlugich piŋayuiŋiññik iñupayaat. "
7680, The number of soldiers on horseback was two hundred million; I heard their number. ,Iñugiaktilaaŋat tusaaŋagiga aŋuyaktit kakaksiraqtuat iñugiaktilaaqaŋarut 200 million. 
7681," Now this is what the horses and their riders looked like in my vision: The riders had breastplates that were fiery red, dark blue, and sulfurous yellow in color. The heads of the horses looked like lions’ heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths. ","Aasii uvaŋa John qiñiqtuuraamni tautuŋagitka tuttuqpaich kakaksiraqtuallu.

Suli niaquŋich tuttuqpaich qiññaqaŋarut lion niaquŋisitun, suli aniġniqaŋarut igniġmik itchimiglu tivluktuamiglu kakavyaŋmik. "
7682," A third of humanity was killed by these three plagues, that is, by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths. ","Taapkunuuna piŋasutigun iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaktigun iñuich piŋayuiŋich tuqutauŋarut, ignikun itchikullu tivluktuakullu kakavyakun aniġniġikkaŋatigun tuttuqpaich. "
7683," For the power of the horses resides in their mouths and in their tails, because their tails are like snakes, having heads that inflict injuries. ","Qanuq suaŋŋatiŋich tuttuqpaich inŋarut ilaisa qaniŋiññi pamiuŋiññiḷu, pamiuŋich nimiġiatun inŋarut niaquqaqłutiŋ, aasii satkugivlugich kiiqsiuqtirrutigiŋagaich iñuŋnun."
7684," The rest of humanity, who had not been killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they did not stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood – idols that cannot see or hear or walk about. ","Kisiŋŋuqtaŋich iñuich tuqutauŋitchuat tamatkunuuna iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaktigun, nutqaŋaitchut aŋaiyyuvigisuŋaiġḷugich savaaŋich argagmiŋ.

7685," Furthermore, they did not repent of their murders, of their magic spells, of their sexual immorality, or of their stealing.",Naaggaunnii isumalitqiŋaiñmiut iñuaqtuġniġmikkun aŋatkuuniġmikkullu allatuqtauniġmikkullu naaggaunnii tigligaġniġmikkun.
7686," Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head; his face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire. ","Tavra uvaŋa John tautuŋalgitchuŋa allamik sapiġñaqtuamik isaġuliŋmik atqaqtuamik qiḷaŋmiñ maġġusimavluni nuvuyami, rainbow-m qaumanġanik kaivallagutiqaqłuni niaqua. Ilaan kiiñaŋa siqiñiqtun inŋaruq, aasii niuŋik ayyaktun igniġuvlutiŋ. "
7687," He held in his hand a little scroll that was open, and he put his right foot on the sea and his left on the land. ","Ilaa piqaŋaruq immuaġuranik aŋmavlugich makpiġaanik saagaqługich. Tavra ilaan inillaŋagai taliqpiich isigaŋni taġiumun, aasii saumiich isigaŋni nunamun. "
7688," Then he shouted in a loud voice like a lion roaring, and when he shouted, the seven thunders sounded their voices. ","Aasii ququulaŋaruq nipatuvluni, lion-tun ugiallaruatun. Ququulaaniŋman tallimat malġuk kallulavlutiŋ kiuŋagaat. "
7689," When the seven thunders spoke, I was preparing to write, but just then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Seal up what the seven thunders spoke and do not write it down.” ","Tavra tallimat malġuk kalluich nivlianiŋmata, aglaksaġumaŋaruŋa. Aglaan tusaaŋaruŋa uqallaktuamik qiḷaŋmiñ, Iḷisimanaqtinnagich tallimat malġuk kalluich uqalugikkaŋich suli aglautinagich."
7690, Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven ,"Tavraasii isaġulik tautukkaġa makitaruaq taġiumi nunamiḷu isaaŋaruq taliqpiŋmiñik qiḷaŋmun, "
7691," and swore by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, and the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, “There will be no more delay! ","aasii kiliŋniŋaruq pisivlugu God iñuuruaq taimuŋa isuitchuamun, savaŋaruaq qiḷaŋmik suniglu qiḷaŋmiittuanik, nunamiglu nunamiittuaniglu, taġiumiglu taġiumiittuaniglu. Isaġulik uqallaŋaruq, God piñatchiaŋaiqsaqtuq tavraŋŋaaglaan. "
7692," But in the days when the seventh angel is about to blow his trumpet, the mystery of God is completed, just as he has proclaimed to his servants the prophets.” ","Tavra tallimat malġuat isaġulgich nipauqłuktaqpan, God-im naanniaġaa kaŋiqsiñaiñŋaruaq sivunniuġutigiŋarani uqautigiŋarani kivgamiñun uqaqtigiŋaramiñun."
7693," Then the voice I had heard from heaven began to speak to me again, “Go and take the open scroll in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.” ","Tavrani tusaaŋakkaġa uqallaktuaq qiḷaŋmiñ uqallatqiŋaruq uvamnun, Aullaġiñ, tiguyaqtukkich immuat makpiġaat aŋmaruat argaŋiñi isaġulgum makitaruam taġiumiḷu nunamiḷu. "
7694," So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take the scroll and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth.” ","Tavra ullautiŋaruŋa isaġuliŋmun aasii apiġivlugu qaitquvlugich uvamnun immuaġurat makpiġaat, aasii ilaan uqallautiŋagaaŋa, Tigulugich niġikkich. Siiġḷanŋulatchiñiaġaluaġaatin aqiaġuġni, aglaan siiġñaaġniaqtuq honey-sun qaniġni. "
7695," So I took the little scroll from the angel’s hand and ate it, and it did taste as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter. ","Tavra tiguŋagitka immuaġurat makpiġaat argaŋiñiñ isaġulgum aasii niġivḷugich. Siiġñaaqtigiŋarut qanimni honey-sun, aglaan niġianikapkich aqiaġuġa siiġḷanŋuliŋaruq. "
7696," Then they told me: “You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.”","Tavraasii uqallaurrauŋaruŋa, Alġaqsruivsaaqtuksraurutin God-im uqaluŋiñik iñugiaktuatigun iñuktigun nunauruatigullu qanusiḷimaaniglu uqausiqaqtuatigun, umialiktigullu."
7697," Then a measuring rod like a staff was given to me, and I was told, “Get up and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and the ones who worship there. ","Tavrani aitchuusiaqaŋaruŋa uuktuunmik ayauppiatun ittuamik, aasii uqallaurrauŋaruŋa, Makillutin uuktuġuŋ aŋaiyyuvikpaŋa God-im ikipkaivigḷu iñugiaktilaaŋallu taapkua aŋaiyyuruat tavrani. "
7698," But do not measure the outer courtyard of the temple; leave it out, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample on the holy city for forty-two months. ","Aglaan uuktuġnagu siḷalliq kasimmavik siḷataani aŋaiyyuvikpaum.

7699," And I will grant my two witnesses authority to prophesy for 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth. ","Aasii uvaŋa tiliñiaġikka malġuk uqaqtikka annuġaaqaġlugik miitchuŋnik ukił̣haanik, aasii iliŋik suaŋŋasiqsauniaqtuk alġaqsruiyumiñaqsiḷugik taapkunani 1,260 uvluni."
7700, (These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.) ,Taapkuak malġuk uqaqtik God-im malġuk Olive napaaqtuk malġuglu qulliqaġviik naparuak sivuġaani Atanġata nunam. 
7701," If anyone wants to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and completely consumes their enemies. If anyone wants to harm them, they must be killed this way. ","Tavraasii kialiqaa anniaġumasaġaluaqpagik, igniq pikiaġaqtuq qaniŋiŋniñ aasii suksraunġiqł̣ugich uumigiriŋik. Kialiqaa anniaġumasaġaluaġmagik, ilaa tuqutauruksraġuġaqtuq. "
7702, These two have the power to close up the sky so that it does not rain during the time they are prophesying. They have power to turn the waters to blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague whenever they want. ,"Suaŋŋatiqaġmiuk sialukkumiñaiḷḷavlugu uvluŋiññi alġaqsruiñiġmiŋ, suli suaŋŋatiqaqłutiŋ imiġnun auguqtillavlugich.

7703," When they have completed their testimony, the beast that comes up from the abyss will make war on them and conquer them and kill them. ","Tavraasii iliŋikta naatanikpatku uqaqtuaġniqtik, niġrułłuum mayuqtuam mitaiḷamiñ putumiñ aŋuyagniaġik aasii akiisillugik tuqullugiglu. "
7704," Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city that is symbolically called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was also crucified. ",Aasii timiŋik nalaniaqtuk apqutiŋiñi iniqpaum Atanġata kikiaktuurrauviani aŋarrauramun. Taamna iniqpak atiqaqtuatun inmiuq Sodom-mik naagga Egypt-mik. 
7705," For three and a half days those from every people, tribe, nation, and language will look at their corpses, because they will not permit them to be placed in a tomb. ","Tavra piŋasuni uvluni avvaġmik iḷavlugich iḷaŋich iñuich maŋŋuqatigiipayaaniḷḷu uqautchiñiḷḷu nunauruaniḷḷu takunnaŋagaich tuquŋaruak timiŋik, iḷuviquŋiñmivḷugik. "
7706," And those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and celebrate, even sending gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those who live on the earth. ","Tavraasii tamatkua iñuuruat nunami quviasualaniaqtut pisigilugik tuquruak taapkuak.

7707," But after three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet, and tremendous fear seized those who were watching them. ","Tavra uvlut piŋasut avvaġmik iḷaqaqłutiŋ pianiŋmata, God-im aniġniŋan iñuggutim isiŋagik, aasii iliŋik makinŋaruk, tavraasii iñuich tautuktuat taapkuŋniŋa iqsiḷipiaġataŋarut. "
7708, Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them: “Come up here!” So the two prophets went up to heaven in a cloud while their enemies stared at them. ,"Tavra malġuk taapkuak God-im uqaqtik tusaaŋaruk nipatuvluni nivliqsuamik qiḷaŋmiñ uqallaktuamik ilimiŋnun, Mayuġitchik. Tavra takkuanni uumigirimiŋ iliŋik mayuŋaruk qiḷaŋmun nuvuyakun. "
7709," Just then a major earthquake took place and a tenth of the city collapsed; seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.","Tavra tavrauvvaa nuna aulaqpaŋaruq, aasii quliŋŋuġutiŋich iniqpaum ulġuŋaruq, aasii 7,000 iñuich tuqutauŋarut nuna aulamman, aasii kisiŋŋuqtauruat iñuich tatamaatchaŋarut aasii nanġaqługu kamanaqtuaq God qiḷaŋmiittuaq.

7711," Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven saying:","Tavrani tallimat malġuat isaġulgich nipauqłuktaŋaruq.

7712,“The kingdom of the world ,"Tavra iñuiññaq sisamat umialiŋnat aquppiruat aquppiutaqpaŋmiŋni sivuġaani God-im sitquqłutiŋ punŋarut aasii nanġaqługu God, "
7713,has become the kingdom of our Lord ,"uqaqłutiŋ,"
7714,"and of his Christ, ",
7715,and he will reign for ever and ever.”,
7716, Then the twenty-four elders who are seated on their thrones before God threw themselves down with their faces to the ground and worshiped God ,
7717, with these words:,
7718,"“We give you thanks, Lord God, the All-Powerful,",
7719,"the one who is and who was,",
7720,because you have taken your great power,
7721,and begun to reign.,
7722," The nations were enraged,",
7723,"but your wrath has come,",
7724,"and the time has come for the dead to be judged,",
7725,"and the time has come to give to your servants, ",
7726,"the prophets, their reward,",
7727,as well as to the saints ,
7728,"and to those who revere your name, both small and great,",
7729,and the time has come to destroy those who destroy the earth.”,
7730," Then the temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant was visible within his temple. And there were flashes of lightning, roaring, crashes of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm.",
7731," Then a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and with the moon under her feet, and on her head was a crown of twelve stars. ","Tavra kamanaqtuaq aliuġnaq salapqiŋaruq qiḷaŋmi. Aġnaq annuġaalik siqiñiġmik, tatqiq isigaŋisa ataaniiłłuni, suli niaqqumiñi niaquġutiqaqłuni qulit malġugnik uvluġianik. "
7732," She was pregnant and was screaming in labor pains, struggling to give birth. ",Iġñiyasiñiqsuaq kiiqsiuqłuni iġñiñialakami nipaalaŋaruq. 
7733," Then another sign appeared in heaven: a huge red dragon that had seven heads and ten horns, and on its heads were seven diadem crowns. ","Aasiisuli alla aliuġnaqtuaq salapqiŋaruq qiḷaŋmi. Uvva kamanaqtuaq kaviqsuaq nimiġiaqłuk, tallimat malġugnik niaqulik aasii qulinik nagruqaqłuni, aasii tallimat malġugnik niaquġutiqaqłuni niaqqumiñi. "
7734," Now the dragon’s tail swept away a third of the stars in heaven and hurled them to the earth. Then the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that he might devour her child as soon as it was born. ","Ilaan pamiuŋan kaligaŋagai piŋayuiŋich uvluġiaŋisa qiḷaum, aasii miḷuqsautivlugich nunamun. Tavra nimiġiaqłuk makitaŋaruq sivuġaani aġnam iġñisaġumaaqtuam, niġisukługu miqłiqtua anipqauraqpan. "
7735," So the woman gave birth to a son, a male child, who is going to rule over all the nations with an iron rod. Her child was suddenly caught up to God and to his throne, ","Aġnaq iġñiŋaruq aŋunmik, atanniqsimannigniaqtuamik suaŋŋatiqpaqapiaġataġluni nunapayaanun, anauttaqaġluni savił̣hamik umialgum anauttaŋanik.

7736," and she fled into the wilderness where a place had been prepared for her by God, so she could be taken care of for 1,260 days.","Aasii aġnaq pigruŋaruq nunagluktuamun, iniksriuqtaŋanun God-im ilaanun. Tavrani munaqqusiaqaqtuksrauniaqłuni 1,260 uvluni."
7737," Then war broke out in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought back. ","Tavra aŋuyaksaŋarut qiḷaŋmi, Michael-lu isaġuliŋniḷu aŋuyakługu nimiġiaqłuk, nimiġiaqłuktauq aŋuyagmipkaqługu piqatigivlugich isaġuliŋni. "
7738," But the dragon was not strong enough to prevail, so there was no longer any place left in heaven for him and his angels. ",Tavra nimiġiaqłuk akiiñŋaruq aasii ilaalu isaġuliŋniḷu iniksraiqsauŋarut qiḷaŋmi tavraŋŋaaglaan. 
7739," So that huge dragon – the ancient serpent, the one called the devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world – was thrown down to the earth, and his angels along with him. ","Tavra kamanaqtuaq nimiġiaqłuk igitauŋaruq anmun. Taamna aippaaġnisaq nimiġiaq, atiqaqtuaq Tuunġaġmik Satan-miglu, sagluqiraqtiŋat iñupayaurat nunami.

7748,by the blood of the Lamb,Aasiiḷi nimiġiaqłuk makitaŋaruq taġium siñaani.
7749,"and by the word of their testimony,",
7750,and they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid to die.,
7751," Therefore you heavens rejoice, and all who reside in them!",
7752,But woe to the earth and the sea ,
7753,because the devil has come down to you! ,
7754,"He is filled with terrible anger, ",
7755,for he knows that he only has a little time!”,
7756," Now when the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child. ",
7757," But the woman was given the two wings of a giant eagle so that she could fly out into the wilderness, to the place God prepared for her, where she is taken care of – away from the presence of the serpent – for a time, times, and half a time. ",
7758," Then the serpent spouted water like a river out of his mouth after the woman in an attempt to sweep her away by a flood, ",
7759, but the earth came to her rescue; the ground opened up and swallowed the river that the dragon had spewed from his mouth. ,
7760," So the dragon became enraged at the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her children, those who keep God’s commandments and hold to the testimony about Jesus. ",
7761, And the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.,
7762," Then I saw a beast coming up out of the sea. It had ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns were ten diadem crowns, and on its heads a blasphemous name. ","Tavra uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa niġrułłuŋmik qakiruamik taġiumiñ, qulinik nagrulik aasii tallimat malġugnik niaquqaqłuni. Taapkunani qulini nagruŋiñi niaquġutillaat inŋarut, suli niaqullaaŋiñi aglautiŋavlutiŋ uqamaqłuutit atqich pisaaŋŋatauruat God-mun. "
7763," Now the beast that I saw was like a leopard, but its feet were like a bear’s, and its mouth was like a lion’s mouth. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority to rule. ","Tavra niġrułłuk tautukkaġa inŋaruq leopard-tun, isigaŋiasii nannum isigaŋisun, aasii qanġa lion qanġatun iłłuni. Tavra nimiġiaqłuum aitchuŋagaa niġrułłuk suaŋŋanmiñik aquppiutaqpaŋmiñiglu kamanaqtuamiglu ataniġnaqunmik. "
7764," One of the beast’s heads appeared to have been killed, but the lethal wound had been healed. And the whole world followed the beast in amazement; ","Iḷaŋat niaquŋisa qiññaqaŋaruq tuquagun ikiḷḷiiratun, aglaan taavruma tuquagun ikiŋa mamititauŋaruq, aasii iñupayaurat nunami maliġuarraqsiŋagaat niġrułłuk kamasuuttaġivlugu. "
7765," they worshiped the dragon because he had given ruling authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast too, saying: “Who is like the beast?” and “Who is able to make war against him?” ","Iluqaġmiŋ iñuich qiksigiŋagaat nanġaqługulu nimiġiaqłuk, qanuq ilaa aitchuiŋaruq ataniġnaqunmiñik niġrułłuŋmun, suli ilaisa tainnatun piŋammigaat niġrułłuk, uqaqłutiŋ, Kiña itpa niġrułłuktun, suli kia aŋuyakkumiñaqpauŋ?"
7766," The beast was given a mouth speaking proud words and blasphemies, and he was permitted to exercise ruling authority for forty-two months. ","Tavra niġrułłuk uqaqtitauŋaruq pigiipiaġataqtuanik uqaluŋnik, suli ataniġnaqutiqaqtitauvluni malġukipiaq malġugni tatqiñi. "
7767," So the beast opened his mouth to blaspheme against God – to blaspheme both his name and his dwelling place, that is, those who dwell in heaven. ","Taavruma uqamaqłuutigirraqsiŋagaa God atqalu, God-ivlu iñuuvia taputivlugich iñupayaurat iñuuruat qiḷaŋmi. "
7768," The beast was permitted to go to war against the saints and conquer them. He was given ruling authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation, ",Suli aŋuyaktitauŋaruq God-im iñuŋiñun suli akiiḷivḷugich. Tavraasii ataniġnaqusiqsauŋaruq tamatkunuŋa maŋŋuqatigiipayaanun iñuŋnullu uqautchiñullu nunauruanullu. 
7769," and all those who live on the earth will worship the beast, everyone whose name has not been written since the foundation of the world in the book of life belonging to the Lamb who was killed. ","Suli iluqaġmiŋ iñuuruat nunami qiksiginiaġaat nanġaġlugulu, iñupayaat atiŋich aglausimaŋitchuat sivuani nuna savaaguŋaiñŋaan makpiġaaŋiññi iñuuruat pigikkaŋisa Imnaiyaam tuqutauŋaruam. "
7770," If anyone has an ear, he had better listen! ","Kiñaliqaa siutiqaġumi tusaggatiksraŋnik, naalaġniḷi. "
7771," If anyone is meant for captivity,","Kiñaliqaa tigurauniaġumi, tigurauviŋmugniaqtuq. Kiñaliqaa iñuaqtauniaġumi, nalupqinaitchuq iñuktauniaqtuq savikpagaġlugu. Taamna pikpan, God-im iñuŋi igḷutuutiruksraurut ukpiġutiqaqtuiññaġlutiglu."
7772,into captivity he will go.,Tavrani uvaŋa John tautulgitchuŋa allamik niġrułłuŋmik salapqiqsuamik nunamiñ. Malġugnik nagruqaġniqsuaq imnaiyaatun aasii uqausiqaqłuni nimiġiaqłuktun.

7774,then by the sword he must be killed.,"Taamna aqulliq niġrułłuk savaŋaruq kamanaqtuanik aliuġnaqtuanik, igniq unnii atqaqtitaqługu qiḷaŋmiñ nunamun takkuanni iñupayaat. "
7775,This requires steadfast endurance and faith from the saints.,"Aasii aliuġnaqtuatigun savaaġipkaqtitakkaŋisigun ilaanun sivuġaani sivullium niġrułłuum, sagluqiŋagaich tamatkua iluqaisa iñuuruat nunami.

7776," Then I saw another beast coming up from the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but was speaking like a dragon. ","Aasii taamna aqulliq niġrułłuk suaŋŋatiqaŋaruq qaitchiḷḷavluni iñuggunmik iñuŋŋuaŋanun niġrułłuum, taamna iñuuraqpaŋa niġrułłuum uqallasivḷugu suli tamatkua iñugiaktilaaŋatitun qiksiksrautaitchuat nanġaisuŋitchuallu iñuuraqpaŋanun niġrułłuum tuqutautquvlugich. "
7777," He exercised all the ruling authority of the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and those who inhabit it worship the first beast, the one whose lethal wound had been healed. ","Suli taavruma aqullium niġrułłuum nalunaiñŋutchiqsinniaġai taliqpiŋisigun argaŋisa naaggaunnii qauŋisigun iluqaisa iñuich kamanaitchuallu kamanaġaluaqtuallu, suġalliruallu iḷiappaugaluaqtuallu, atanġitchuallu kivgallu. "
7778," He performed momentous signs, even making fire come down from heaven in front of people ","Kiñaliqaa tauqsiġumiñaiññiaqtuq naagga tunisiyumiñaiññiaqtuq nalunaiñŋutchiqsauŋaisuaġumi taavrumiŋa, atqanik niġrułłuum naaggaunnii kisirrutaanik atqata. "
7779," and, by the signs he was permitted to perform on behalf of the beast, he deceived those who live on the earth. He told those who live on the earth to make an image to the beast who had been wounded by the sword, but still lived. ","Kaŋiqsisiqaqtuksrauniq ittuksrauruq taavrumuuna. Iñuk kaŋiqsisiqaqtuaq kisitchiḷi kisirrutaanik niġrułłuum. Taamna kisirrutigigaa iñuum, kisirrutiqaqtuaq 666-mik."
7780," The second beast was empowered to give life to the image of the first beast so that it could speak, and could cause all those who did not worship the image of the beast to be killed. ",
7781," He also caused everyone (small and great, rich and poor, free and slave) to obtain a mark on their right hand or on their forehead. ",
7782," Thus no one was allowed to buy or sell things unless he bore the mark of the beast – that is, his name or his number. ",
7783," This calls for wisdom: Let the one who has insight calculate the beast’s number, for it is man’s number, and his number is 666.",
7784," Then I looked, and here was the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were one hundred and forty-four thousand, who had his name and his Father’s name written on their foreheads. ","Tavrani uvaŋa John qiviaŋaruŋa, aasii tautuŋagiga Imnaiyaaq makitaruaq Iġġim Zion qaaŋani, piqatiqaqłuni 144,000 iñuŋnik piqaqtuanik atiġmiñik Aapamiḷu atqanik aglausimavlugik qauŋiññi. "
7785," I also heard a sound coming out of heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. Now the sound I heard was like that made by harpists playing their harps, ",Tavra tusaaŋaruŋa nipimik qiḷaŋmiñ arriqaqtuamik tusaaruni quġluqtaqpaktun kallulaqpaktuatullu. Nipi tusaakkaġa inŋaruq nipiŋisitun nuqaqtiligaqtuat atuqtuuraġmata. 
7786, and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one was able to learn the song except the one hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth. ,"Aasii iliŋich atuŋarut nutauruamik atuunmik sanmivḷugich umialgun aquppiutaŋi suli sanmivḷugich sisamat iñuuruat savaat umialiŋnallu.

7787," These are the ones who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from humanity as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb, ","Taapkua iñuich qaunagiŋarut inmiŋnik allatuunmiñ, iliŋich tuvaaqataitchut.

7788, and no lie was found on their lips; they are blameless.,Taapkua iñuich iḷisimanaŋaitchut saglulugich. Pasiñaġumiñaitchut.
7789," Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, and he had an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth – to every nation, tribe, language, and people. ","Tavrani tautuŋaruŋa allamik isaġuliŋmik tiŋmiruamik qutchikł̣uni siḷami, piqaqłuni allaŋŋulaitchuamik tusaayugaaġiksuanik quliaqtuaġiraksranik iñupayauranun iñuuruanun nunami, nunauruapayaanun maŋŋuqatigiiñullu uqautchiñullu iñuŋnullu. "
7790," He declared in a loud voice: “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has arrived, and worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water!”","Tavra ilaa uqallaŋaruq nipatuvluni, Qiksiksrautiqaġitchi God-mun nanġaġlugu kamanautaagun, qanuq isivġiiñiksraŋa iñuŋnik tikitchuq. Puttitchi qiksigilugu sivuġaanun God-im savaŋaruam qiḷaŋmik nunamiglu, taġiumik maqsraluktuanik imiġnik. "
7791," A second angel followed the first, declaring: “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great city! She made all the nations drink of the wine of her immoral passion.”","Allasuli igḷua isaġulik malgutiŋaruq sivulliġmun uqallakłuni, Suksraunġiqsauruq, kamanaqtuaq Babylon suksraunġiqsauruq. Qanuq Babylon inanŋagai iñupayaurat aasii wine-tuqatigivlugich wine-ŋanik allatuutiqpaŋmi. "
7792," A third angel followed the first two, declaring in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and takes the mark on his forehead or his hand, ","Allasuli piŋayuak isaġulik malgutiŋaruq taapkuŋnuŋa uqallakłuni nipatuvluni, Iñuum kialiqaa qiksigilugu nanġaqpagu niġrułłuk iñuuraqpaŋalu, suli nalunaiñŋutchiqsinŋagumi qaumigun naagga argaŋmigun, "
7793," that person will also drink of the wine of God’s anger that has been mixed undiluted in the cup of his wrath, and he will be tortured with fire and sulfur in front of the holy angels and in front of the Lamb. ","ilaaptauq imiġniaġmiuq wine-ŋanik God-im qinnautaata, kuvirauŋaruamik avuuġaluaġnagu qallutaanun God-im tatavsautaan.

7794," And the smoke from their torture will go up forever and ever, and those who worship the beast and his image will have no rest day or night, along with anyone who receives the mark of his name.” ","Suli puyua nagliksaaqtirrutaata avyualaŋaruq taimuŋa isuitchuamun, suli iliŋich piḷaiŋaiqsiaġviitchut, uvlumi naagga unnuami, taapkua qiksiksrautiqaqtuat niġrułłuŋmun iñuuraqpaŋanullu, suli kisupayaat nalunaiñŋutchiqsittuat ilaan atqanik."
7795, This requires the steadfast endurance of the saints – those who obey God’s commandments and hold to their faith in Jesus.,"Tainna piraummata taapkua iñuich, God-im iñuŋi qapiŋaisaaqtaulich igḷutuġumiñaqsiḷugich nagliksaaqtirrusiat tamatkunuŋa kamaksriruanun God-im pitquraŋiñik ukpiġutiqaqtuanullu Jesus-mun."
7796," Then I heard a voice from heaven say, “Write this: ","Tusaaŋammiuŋa nipimik qiḷaŋmiñ uqallaktuamik, Aglauttuuŋ una. Quviasuglich tuquruat tavraŋŋaaglaan savautivlugu Ataniq.

7799,"“Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they can rest from their hard work, because their deeds will follow them.”","Tavra taavruma aquppiruam nuvuyam qaaŋani atuqsaŋagaa kivrisini nunamun, aasii nunami palauvaksrat katitauŋarut."
7800," Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and seated on the cloud was one like a son of man! He had a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. ","Tavra allasuli isaġulik aniŋaruq aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmiñ qiḷaŋmi, piqaġmiñiqsuaq ipiktuamik kivriñmik. "
7801," Then another angel came out of the temple, shouting in a loud voice to the one seated on the cloud, “Use your sickle and start to reap, because the time to reap has come, since the earth’s harvest is ripe!” ","Tavrani allasuli isaġulik ataniġnaqutiqaqtuaq igniġmun qaiŋaruq ikipkaiviŋmiñ.

7804," Another angel, who was in charge of the fire, came from the altar and called in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, “Use your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of grapes off the vine of the earth, because its grapes are now ripe.” ",
7805, So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and gathered the grapes from the vineyard of the earth and tossed them into the great winepress of the wrath of God. ,
7806," Then the winepress was stomped outside the city, and blood poured out of the winepress up to the height of horses’ bridles for a distance of almost two hundred miles.",
7807, Then I saw another great and astounding sign in heaven: seven angels who have seven final plagues (they are final because in them God’s anger is completed). ,"Tavrani uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa allamik aliuġnaqtuamik kamanaqtuamik qiḷaŋmi, tallimat malġuk isaġulgich piqaqłutiŋ tallimat malġugnik iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaŋnik aqulliqsaaġutinik.

7808," Then I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and his image and the number of his name. They were standing by the sea of glass, holding harps given to them by God. ","Tavra tautuŋagiga arriḷiñaqtuaq taġiutun igalauratun iḷaŋavluni igniġmik, taapkualu akiiḷiññiktuat niġrułłuŋmik iñuuraqpaŋaniglu kisirrutaaniglu atqata.

7815,"and glorify your name, because you alone are holy?",
7816,All nations will come and worship before you,
7817,for your righteous acts have been revealed.”,
7818," After these things I looked, and the temple (the tent of the testimony) was opened in heaven, ",
7819," and the seven angels who had the seven plagues came out of the temple, dressed in clean bright linen, wearing wide golden belts around their chests. ",
7820," Then one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven golden bowls filled with the wrath of God who lives forever and ever, ",
7821, and the temple was filled with smoke from God’s glory and from his power. Thus no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues from the seven angels were completed.,
7822, Then I heard a loud voice from the temple declaring to the seven angels: “Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls containing God’s wrath.” ,"Tavrani tusaaŋaruŋa nipaturuamik nipimik aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmiñ uqallaktuamik tallimat malġuŋnun isaġuliŋnun, Aullaġlusi kuviyaqtuqsigik nunamun tallimat malġuk puvialuŋaat puggut imaqaqtuat qinnautaanik God-im. "
7823, So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth. Then ugly and painful sores appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image. ,Tavra sivulliq isaġulik aullaŋaruq aasii kuvivḷugu pugguni nunamun.

7824," Next, the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood, like that of a corpse, and every living creature that was in the sea died.","Igḷuasuli isaġulik kuvisiŋaruq puggumiñik taġiumun, aasii taġiuq irrusiñiŋaruq auŋatun tuquŋaruam iñuum, aasii iluqaqpiuraġmik uumaruurat taġiumiittuat tuquŋarut.

7826, Now I heard the angel of the waters saying:,"Tavra uvaŋa John tusaaŋagiga isaġulik ataniġnaqutiqaqtuaq immanun uqallaktuaq, Nalaunŋapiaqtutin tatavsaikavich tainna, ilivich ittuatiin inŋaruatiillu, Piḷuutaitchuatiin. "
7827,"“You are just – the one who is and who was,","Qanuq iñuich maqipkaiŋarut auŋiññik ukpiqtuat uqaqtiŋisalu God-im, aasiiḷi ilivich aitchuŋagitin auŋmik imiksraŋannik. Tainnagaksraurutkiataŋ. "
7828,"the Holy One – because you have passed these judgments,","Tavra tusaaŋaruŋa nipimik ikipkaiviŋmiñ uqallaktuamik, Aaŋ, Ataniiq God Sapiġñaqtuatiin, iḷumun nalaunŋapiaqtut ilivich tatavsautitin."
7829," because they poured out the blood of your saints and prophets,","Sisamaŋat isaġulgich kuvisiŋaruq puggumiñik siqiñiġmun, aasii siqiñġum ikiŋagai iñuich uunaqpaił̣ł̣uni. "
7830,so you have given them blood to drink. They got what they deserved!”,"Iñuich ikiŋagai suamaruam uunnaum, aasii ilaisa taimaqłuktaŋagaat atqa God-im suaŋŋatiqaqtuam tamatkunuŋa iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaŋnun, suli iliŋich isumalitqiŋaitchut nanġaŋaitkaallu kamanaġniḷugu. "
7831," Then I heard the altar reply, “Yes, Lord God, the All-Powerful, your judgments are true and just!”","Tallimaŋat isaġulgich kuvisiŋaruq puggumiñik aquppiutaqpaŋanun niġrułłuum, aasii niġrułłuum atanniqsimmataa taaqsiŋaruq. Iñuich kiŋmaŋagaich uqqatiŋ kiiqsiuqpaił̣ł̣utiŋ. "

7833," Thus people were scorched by the terrible heat, yet they blasphemed the name of God, who has ruling authority over these plagues, and they would not repent and give him glory.","Itchaksraŋat isaġulgich kuvisiŋaruq puggumiñik kamanaqtuamun kuuŋmun Euphrates-mun, aasii imaŋa kuugum imaiŋaruq, itqanaiqsaqługu iglauyaaksraŋat umialgich qavaŋŋamiñ.

7834," Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast so that darkness covered his kingdom, and people began to bite their tongues because of their pain. ",Tavraasii uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa piŋasunik ilitqusiqł̣uŋnik qiññaqaqtuanik naaġaayisun pikiaqtuanik qanġaniñ nimiġiaqłuum suli qanġaniñ niġrułłuum suli qanġaniñ uqaqtauŋŋuaqtuam God-mun. 
7835," They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their sufferings and because of their sores, but nevertheless they still refused to repent of their deeds. ",Tavra taapkua ilitqusiqł̣uich savaktuat aliuġnaqtuanik.

7837," Then I saw three unclean spirits that looked like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. ",Tavra ilitqusiqł̣uich katinŋagaich umialgich inimun taggisiqaqtuamun Jew-guruat uqausiatigun Armageddon. 
7838," For they are the spirits of the demons performing signs who go out to the kings of the earth to bring them together for the battle that will take place on the great day of God, the All-Powerful. ","Tallimat malġuakta isaġulgich kuviŋagaa pugguni siḷamun. Tavraasii kamanaqtuaq nipi nivliŋaruq aquppiutaqpaŋmiñ aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmi, uqallakłuni, Naatchirut. "
7839, (Look! I will come like a thief!,"Tavraasii qaummatitaŋaruq igniġuuqpatitaqtuaq, nipaturuallu sukpaluich, kallularaġaqtuaġlu, nunalu aulaqpakłuni. Qaŋaunnii nuna tainnatun aulaŋaitchuq iñuk savaagumman. Taamna suaġiiññiqsrauŋaruq qaŋapak nunam aulaniŋaniñ. "

7841, Now the spirits gathered the kings and their armies to the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.,"Suli qikiqtapayaat qiñiġnaiŋarut, iluqaġmiglu iġġich piiŋarut. "
7842," Finally the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying: “It is done!” ","Suli kamanaqtuat natatquġnat, uqumaisilaaqaqtuat sukautiqpaktun katagaŋarut qiḷaŋmiñ iñuŋnun.

7843," Then there were flashes of lightning, roaring, and crashes of thunder, and there was a tremendous earthquake – an earthquake unequaled since humanity has been on the earth, so tremendous was that earthquake. ",
7844," The great city was split into three parts and the cities of the nations collapsed. So Babylon the great was remembered before God, and was given the cup filled with the wine made of God’s furious wrath. ",
7845, Every island fled away and no mountains could be found. ,
7846," And gigantic hailstones, weighing about a hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people, but they blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, since it was so horrendous.",
7847," Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke to me. “Come,” he said, “I will show you the condemnation and punishment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters, ","Tavrani iḷaŋata isaġulgich tallimat malġuuruat piqaŋaruat tallimat malġuŋnik puvialuŋaanik puggunik qaivḷuni uvamnun John-mun uqallautiŋagaaŋa, Qaiñ, tautuktinniaġikpiñ tatavsausiaksraŋanik kamanaqtuam allatuqtim aġnam, taavruma kamanaqtuam iniqpaum naparuam qitqanni iñugiaktuat kuugich.

7848, with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and the earth’s inhabitants got drunk with the wine of her immorality.” ,"Umialiŋi nunam allatuqatiqaŋarut taavrumiŋa kamanaqtuamik allatuqtimik, suli iñuŋi nunam imiŋasisiqaŋarut imiqłutiŋ wine-ŋanik allatuutaata."
7849," So he carried me away in the Spirit to a wilderness, and there I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names and had seven heads and ten horns. ","Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalanŋagaaŋa, aasii isaġulgum aullautiŋagaaŋa nunagluktuamun.

7850," Now the woman was dressed in purple and scarlet clothing, and adorned with gold, precious stones, and pearls. She held in her hand a golden cup filled with detestable things and unclean things from her sexual immorality. ","Aġnaq annuġaaqaŋaruq suŋauraammaġiksuanik kavviġiksuaniglu, suli qiñiyunaqusiqsuŋavluni maniŋñik kaviqsuanik uyaġaŋnik akisuruanik, suli qatiqtuanik uyaġaŋnik akisuruanik.

7851," On her forehead was written a name, a mystery: “Babylon the Great, the Mother of prostitutes and of the detestable things of the earth.” ","Suli aġnam qauŋani aglausimaŋaruq atiq kaŋiqsiñaiḷaq, Babylon kamanaqtuaq, aakaŋat aġnat allatuqtipayaurat, suli naġġunapiaġataqtuanun agvisauruaq iñuuraqpaŋnun qiksikkunmik nunam iñuŋiñi. "
7852, I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of those who testified to Jesus. I was greatly astounded when I saw her. ,"Tavra tautuŋagiga aġnaq, imiŋasiruaq auŋannik God-im iñuŋisa auŋanniglu iñuktauruat pisigivlugu iḷumun inniqtiŋ Jesus-mun.

7853," But the angel said to me, “Why are you astounded? I will interpret for you the mystery of the woman and of the beast with the seven heads and ten horns that carries her. ","Tavra isaġulgum apiġiŋagaaŋa, Suvlutin aliuqpich? Quliaqtuaġutiniaġikpiñ kaŋiqsiḷgunaitchuaŋanik aġnam, niġrułłuuvlu kakaksiġvigikkaŋata niaquqaqtuam tallimat malġugnik suli qulinik nagruqaqtuam. "
7854," The beast you saw was, and is not, but is about to come up from the abyss and then go to destruction. The inhabitants of the earth – all those whose names have not been written in the book of life since the foundation of the world – will be astounded when they see that the beast was, and is not, but is to come. ","Niġrułłuk tautukkan iñuuŋaruaq, paŋmapak iñuuŋaiqsuq, mayuġumaaqsiruq natqiḷamiñ putumiñ aasii aullaġluni suksraunġiqsauyaqtuġluni.

7855, (This requires a mind that has wisdom.) The seven heads are seven mountains the woman sits on. They are also seven kings: ,Isumattutiqaqtuksrauniq kaŋiqsisiqaqtuksrauniġlu taavrumuuna iḷiruq. Tallimat malġuk niaquŋi niġrułłuum sivuniqaqtut tallimat malġugnun qimiqqanun aġnam aquppiviŋiñik.

7857," The beast that was, and is not, is himself an eighth king and yet is one of the seven, and is going to destruction.

7858," The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but will receive ruling authority as kings with the beast for one hour. ","Aasii taapkua qulit nagruich tautukkatin qulit umialgich aitchuusiaqaaniŋaitchuat suli umialguniġmi suaŋŋanmik, aglaan aitchuusiaqaġumaaqtut ataniġnaqunmik umialiktitun sivikitchuami, iluqaġmiŋ piqatigilugu niġrułłuk.

7859," These kings have a single intent, and they will give their power and authority to the beast. ",Taapkua atausiuruamik isumaqaqtut aasii aitchuutigivlugich suaŋŋatitiŋ ataniġnaqutitiglu niġrułłuŋmun. 
7860," They will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those accompanying the Lamb are the called, chosen, and faithful.” ","Iliŋich aŋuyaŋniaqtut Imnaiyaamun, aasii Imnaiyaam ilaallu ququaqtaŋisa piksraqtaaŋisalu ukpiġnaqłutiŋ maliġuaqtauruallu ilaanun akiiḷiñiaġaich, qanuq ilaa Ataniġigaat atanġich suli Umialigigaat umialgich."
7861," Then the angel said to me, “The waters you saw (where the prostitute is seated) are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages. ","Isaġulgum uqallautivsaaŋagaaŋa, Imġich tautukkatin aġnam aquppivigikkaŋi sivuniqaqtut iñuŋnik iñugiapiaġataqtuanik nunauruaniglu uqausipayaaniglu. "
7862," The ten horns that you saw, and the beast – these will hate the prostitute and make her desolate and naked. They will consume her flesh and burn her up with fire. ","Qulit nagruich tautukkatin, niġrułługlu uumikłiġñiaqtut allatuqtimik aġnamik. Iliŋisa aanniaġaat suġautapayaaŋiñik aasii qimaglugu annuġaiḷaq.

7863, For God has put into their minds to carry out his purpose by making a decision to give their royal power to the beast until the words of God are fulfilled. ,"God-im isummiqsinŋagai kipiqqutigiyumiñaqsivḷugich taŋŋiġuglugich ilaan sivunniutini savaaġitquvlugich atisiḷutiŋ, suli niġrułłuŋmun aitchuutigivlugich suaŋŋatitiŋ atanniqsimanniŋniġmi God-im uqaluŋi taŋŋiqsiaġilugich.

7865," After these things I saw another angel, who possessed great authority, coming down out of heaven, and the earth was lit up by his radiance.

7877, because her sins have piled up all the way to heaven and God has remembered her crimes. ,"Ikarraġmi atautchimi tammaigai iluqaisa umialgutini. Suli iluqaġmiŋ umiaqpaich umialiŋich taġiuqsiuqtillu iñuich, umiaqpagaqtit iluqaġmiglu akiññagniaqtuat taġiumi makitaŋarut uŋasiksuami, "

7902," And they threw dust on their heads and were shouting with weeping and mourning, ",

7943, Let us rejoice and exult,"Tavrani uvaŋa John tautulgitchuŋa isaġuliŋmik makitaruamik siqiñiġmi, aasii nipatusivḷuni ilaan ququaŋagai iluqaisa tiŋmiat tiŋmiruat siḷami, Qaisitchi. Katittitchi niġiyaqtuġlusi God-im niqinaqusiuqtaqpaŋanun. "
7944,"and give him glory,","Qaiḷusi niġiyaqtuqsigik timiŋich umialgich, timiŋich umialiŋisa aŋuyaktit aŋuyaktillu, suli timiŋich tuttuqpaich kakaksiraqtiŋisalu, suli timiŋiḷḷu iñupayaurat, iluqatiŋ kivgallu atanġitchuallu, kamanaqtuallu kamanaitchuallu iluqaisa."
7945,"because the wedding celebration of the Lamb has come,",Tavra tautuŋagiga niġrułłuk umialiŋiḷu nunam aŋuyaktiŋiḷḷu katittuat aŋuyaksaġumaalliqł̣ugu taamna kakaksiqsuaq tuttuqpaŋmi aŋuyaktiŋiḷu.

7947," She was permitted to be dressed in bright, clean, fine linen” (for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints).","Aasii aŋuyaktiŋik iḷakutauruat tuqutauŋarut savikpaŋmik qairuamik qanġaniñ taavruma kakaksiqsuam tuttuqpaŋmi, aasii iluqaġmiŋ tiŋmiat niġiŋarut niqinŋuġataqłutiŋ timiŋiññiñ tamatkua iñuich."
7948," Then the angel said to me, “Write the following: Blessed are those who are invited to the banquet at the wedding celebration of the Lamb!” He also said to me, “These are the true words of God.” ",
7949," So I threw myself down at his feet to worship him, but he said, “Do not do this! I am only a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony about Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony about Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”",
7950," Then I saw heaven opened and here came a white horse! The one riding it was called “Faithful” and “True,” and with justice he judges and goes to war. ",
7951, His eyes are like a fiery flame and there are many diadem crowns on his head. He has a name written that no one knows except himself. ,
7952," He is dressed in clothing dipped in blood, and he is called the Word of God. ",
7953," The armies that are in heaven, dressed in white, clean, fine linen, were following him on white horses. ",
7954," From his mouth extends a sharp sword, so that with it he can strike the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod, and he stomps the winepress of the furious wrath of God, the All-Powerful. ",
7955, He has a name written on his clothing and on his thigh: “King of kings and Lord of lords.”,
7956," Then I saw one angel standing in the sun, and he shouted in a loud voice to all the birds flying high in the sky:",
7957,"“Come, gather around for the great banquet of God,",
7958," to eat your fill of the flesh of kings, ",
7959,"the flesh of generals, ",
7960,"the flesh of powerful people, ",
7961,"the flesh of horses and those who ride them, ",
7962,"and the flesh of all people, both free and slave, ",
7963,and small and great!”,
7964, Then I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies assembled to do battle with the one who rode the horse and with his army. ,
7965," Now the beast was seized, and along with him the false prophet who had performed the signs on his behalf – signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire burning with sulfur. ",
7966," The others were killed by the sword that extended from the mouth of the one who rode the horse, and all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.",
7967," Then I saw an angel descending from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the abyss and a huge chain. ","Tavrani uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa isaġuliŋmik atqaqtuamik qiḷaŋmiñ, saagaqłuni kiluutchaŋanik mitaiḷam putum kalimñaqpaŋniglu takiruanik. "
7968," He seized the dragon – the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan – and tied him up for a thousand years. ","Tavraasii tiguniqłaŋagaa nimiġiaqłuk, taimña aippaaġnisaq nimiġiaq, Tuunġauruaq Satan-guvluniḷu, aasii qiḷiqsruivḷugu sivunniqł̣ugu 1,000-nun ukiunun. "
7969, The angel then threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it so that he could not deceive the nations until the one thousand years were finished. (After these things he must be released for a brief period of time.),"Tavra isaġulgum siŋinŋagaa putumun aasii pitchiġiiyaqługu nipirrusiqł̣ugulu aŋmaġumiñaiqł̣ugu, Satan-mun sagluqiyumiñaiqł̣ugich nunauruat tavraŋŋaaglaan, 1,000 ukiut naatchiaġilugich. Taapkua aasii aquatigun pituiqsaullaktuksrauniaġmiuq sivikisuurami."
7970, Then I saw thrones and seated on them were those who had been given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of the testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. These had not worshiped the beast or his image and had refused to receive his mark on their forehead or hand. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. ,"Tavrani tautuŋaruŋa umialgich aquppiutaŋiññik iñuŋniglu aquppiruanik tamatkunani aquppiutani.

7971, (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished.) This is the first resurrection. ,"Kisiŋŋuqtaŋich tuquŋaruat aŋiŋaitchut 1,000 ukiut naanŋaiñŋaisa. Taamna sivulliq aŋipkaqtauniŋat tuquŋaruat. "
7972," Blessed and holy is the one who takes part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.","Quviasuktut piḷuutaitchullu taapkua piqatauruat sivulliġmi aŋŋiñmi tuqqunmiñ.

7973," Now when the thousand years are finished, Satan will be released from his prison ","Tavraasii 1,000 ukiut naatpata, Satan pituiqsaullagniaqtuq tigutaaġviŋmiñiñ, "
7974," and will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to bring them together for the battle. They are as numerous as the grains of sand in the sea. ","aasii aniḷuni sagluqiyaqtuġlugich nunauruat siaminŋaruat nunapayaurani, iḷagilugik God-lu Magog-lu.

7975," They went up on the broad plain of the earth and encircled the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and devoured them completely. ",Aasii iliŋich siaminŋarut iluqaanun nunamun iḷuvlugich God-im iñuŋi iniqpaglu piviuttaġikkaŋa. Tavraasii igniq atqaŋaruq qiḷaŋmiñ aasii suksraunġiqł̣ugich. 
7976," And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are too, and they will be tormented there day and night forever and ever.","Tavrani Tuunġaq sagluqinniŋaruaq iliŋiññik igitauŋaruq narvaŋanun igniġum tivluktuavlu kakavyaum, niġrułłuum sagluqqutikullu uqaqtauŋŋuaqtuam God-mun igitauviaŋnun, aasii iliŋich nagliksaaqtitauniaqtut uvlumiḷu unnuamiḷu taimuŋa isuitchuamun."
7977," Then I saw a large white throne and the one who was seated on it; the earth and the heaven fled from his presence, and no place was found for them. ",Tavraniasi uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa aŋiruanik qatiqtuanik umialgum aquppiutaŋanik taavrumiŋalu aquppiruamik taapkunani. Ilaan sivuġaaniñ nunalu qiḷaglu piiŋaruk. 
7978," And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. Then books were opened, and another book was opened – the book of life. So the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to their deeds. ","Tavra tautuŋagitka tuquŋaruat, kamanaġaluaqtuat kamanaitchuallu, makitaruat sivuġaanni umialgum aquppiutaŋisa.

7979," The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each one was judged according to his deeds. ","Iluqaġmiŋ tuquŋaŋaruat tavraniinŋarut, tamatkua taġiumiñ tamatkualu tuqqunmiñ nagliksaaġviŋmiḷḷu. Iluqaġmiŋ isivġiqsauŋarut savaamikkun. "
7980, Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death – the lake of fire. ,Tavraniasiiñ Tuqqullu Nagliksaaġvigḷu igitauŋaruk narvaŋanun igniġum. Tavra taamna igniŋa igḷuata tuqqutim. 
7981," If anyone’s name was not found written in the book of life, that person was thrown into the lake of fire.","Tavra kialiqaa atqa aglausimaŋiñman makpiġaaŋiñi iñuuruat, ilaa igitauŋaruq narvaŋanun igniġum."
7982," Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and earth had ceased to exist, and the sea existed no more. ","Tavrani uvaŋa John tautuŋaruŋa nutauruamik qiḷaŋmik nutauruamiglu nunamik, qanuq sivulliq qiḷak sivulliġḷu nuna piiŋaruk, taġiuġlu piiŋammiuq. "
7983," And I saw the holy city – the new Jerusalem – descending out of heaven from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband. ","Suli tautuŋagiga iniqpak ilaaguaqtauŋaruaq God-mun, nutauruaq Jerusalem, atqaqtuaq qiḷaŋmiñ God-miñ, itqanaiŋavluni niviaqsiatun qiñiyunaqsaŋaruatun kasuġiaqługu uiksrautini. "
7984," And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying: “Look! The residence of God is among human beings. He will live among them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them. ","Suli tusaaŋammiuŋa kamanaqtuamik nipimik umialgum aquppiutaŋiñiñ uqallaktuamik, Uvva, iñuuvia God-im piqasiutiruq iñuŋnun.

7985," He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will not exist any more – or mourning, or crying, or pain, for the former things have ceased to exist.”","Ilaan saluaġniaġai qulvipayaat iriŋiññiñ, suli tuqqun piiġñiaqtuq, isumaaġutaiññiaqtuġlu qirrataiḷḷuniḷu kiiqsiuġutaiḷḷuniḷu tavraŋŋaaglaan, qanuq sivuani pisuuruat piiŋarut. "
7986," And the one seated on the throne said: “Look! I am making all things new!” Then he said to me, “Write it down, because these words are reliable and true.” ","Suli taamna aquppiruaq umialgum aquppiutaŋiñi uqallaŋaruq, Paŋmapak savakkitka supayaat nutaaġuqługich. Suli uqallavsaaqłuni uvamnun, Aglautikkich taapkua, qanuq taapkua uqaluich ukpiġnaqtut iḷumun ittullu. "
7987," He also said to me, “It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one who is thirsty I will give water free of charge from the spring of the water of life. ","Suli ilaan uqallautiŋagaaŋa, Naataniktut, Uvaŋa Alpha-uruŋa Omega-lu, aullaqisaaq isuuruaġlu.

7988," The one who conquers will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be my son. ","Kiñaliqaa akimaruaq kiŋuvaannagniaqtuq tamatkuniŋa iluqaiññik, aasii uvaŋa ilaan God-iginiaġaaŋa, aasiiḷi uvaŋa ilaa iġñiġilugu. "
7989," But to the cowards, unbelievers, detestable persons, murderers, the sexually immoral, and those who practice magic spells, idol worshipers, and all those who lie, their place will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. That is the second death.”","Aglaalli qapiyaruat, ukpiġutaitchuallu, naġġunapiaġataqtuallu, iñuayuktuallu, allatuqtillu, aŋatkuuruallu, iñuuraqpaktuqtuallu, iluqaġmiglu sagluturuat iniqaġniaqtut narvami ikualaruami igniġmi tivluktuamiḷu kakavyaŋmi. Taamna igḷugigaa tuqqutim."
7990," Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven final plagues came and spoke to me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb!” ","Tavrani qaiŋaruq iḷaŋat tallimat malġuk isaġulgich piqaŋaruat tallimat malġuŋnik puvialuŋaanik puunik siḷivinŋaruanik tallimat malġuŋnik aqulliġñik iłuiḷḷiuġutiqpaŋnik, aasii uqallautivluŋa, Qaġġiiñ, tautuktinniaġikpiñ Nuliaksrautaanik Imnaiyaam. "
7991," So he took me away in the Spirit to a huge, majestic mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. ","Tavra Ilitqusiġiksuam aŋalanŋagaaŋa, aasii isaġulgum aullautivluŋa qaaŋanun qutchipiaġataqtuam iġġim. Aasii ilaan tautuktinŋagaaŋa Jerusalem-mik, ilaaguaqtauruamik God-mun atqaqtuamik qiḷaŋmiñ God-miñ. "
7992," The city possesses the glory of God; its brilliance is like a precious jewel, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper. ","Taamna iniqpak qaummatiqaŋaruq qaumanġanik God-im, qaummaŋa arriqaqłuni ayuġnaġniqsrauruatun akisuruatun uyaġaktun qivliqtuatun isiŋnatun, qaummaqtigivluni igalauratun. "
7993," It has a massive, high wall with twelve gates, with twelve angels at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel are written on the gates. ","Taamna iniqpak kamanaqtuanik qutchiksuanik katchiqaqtuq, qulit malġuŋnik upkuaqpaqaqłuni, qulit malġuk isaġulgich qaunaksriruat upkuaqpaŋnik. Upkuaqpaŋni aglausimaŋarut atiŋich qulit malġuk maŋŋuŋisa Israel-guruat. "
7994," There are three gates on the east side, three gates on the north side, three gates on the south side and three gates on the west side. ","Piŋasullaat upkuaqpaich inŋarut avatillaaŋani, kiluaŋnam tuŋaaŋani piŋasut, ikagnam tuŋaaŋani piŋasut, uŋallam tuŋaaŋani piŋasut, uaŋnaaġruum tuŋaaŋani piŋasut. "
7995," The wall of the city has twelve foundations, and on them are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.","Suli katchiŋi iniqpaum qulit malġuŋnik uyaġaŋnik maŋŋuqaqłutiŋ, aglaqaqtuanik qulit malġuŋnik atiŋiññik qulit malġuk tiliraŋisa Imnaiyaam."
7996, The angel who spoke to me had a golden measuring rod with which to measure the city and its foundation stones and wall. ,Tavra taamna isaġulik uqaqtuaq uvamnun piqaŋaruq uuktuunmik maniŋmiñ kaviqsuamiñ piḷiamik uuktuġukługu iniqpak upkuaqpaŋiḷu katchiŋiḷu. 
7997," Now the city is laid out as a square, its length and width the same. He measured the city with the measuring rod at fourteen hundred miles (its length and width and height are equal). ","Tavra iniqpak iññaqaŋaruq sisamanik kaŋiġalluqaqłuni, taktilaaŋa ativluni iraqtutilaaŋanun.

7998," He also measured its wall, one hundred forty-four cubits according to human measurement, which is also the angel’s. ","Ilaan suli uuktuŋagai katchiŋi, aasii 216 isagniqtun qutchiksigivluni, iñuum uuktuusiagun, taavruma isaġulgum uuktuġniŋagun. "
7999," The city’s wall is made of jasper and the city is pure gold, like transparent glass. ","Katchich savaaguŋarut qivliqtuamiñ isiŋnamiñ. Iniqpak savaaguŋaruq qivliqtuamiñ maniŋmiñ kaviqsuamiñ, tapiglakługu qiñiġnaqtuatun igalauratun. "
8000," The foundations of the city’s wall are decorated with every kind of precious stone. The first foundation is jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, ","Maŋŋuŋi katchiŋisa iniqpaum qiñiyunaqusiqsuqtauŋarut qanusipayaanik akisuruanik uyaġaŋnik.

","tallimaŋat kavviġipiaqtuatun kaviqsuatun qivliqtuatun uyaġaktun, itchaksraŋat aasii kaviqsuatun qivliqtuatun uyaġaktun, tallimat malġuat quqsuqtuatun uyaġaktun, tallimat piŋayuat taġium suŋauraaġniŋatun uyaġaktun, quliŋŋuġutaiḷaŋat siḷaliŋaruatun suŋaaqtuatun qivliqtuatun uyaġaktun, quliŋŋuġutaat aasii siḷaliŋałhaaqtuatun suŋaaqtuatun qivliqtuatun uyaġaktun, qulit atausiŋŋuġuutaat piqaluyaum suŋauraaġniŋatun qivliqtuatun uyaġaktun, qulit malġuŋŋuġuutaat suŋauraammaġiksuatun qivliqtuatun uyaġaktun. "
8002," And the twelve gates are twelve pearls – each one of the gates is made from just one pearl! The main street of the city is pure gold, like transparent glass.","Aasii qulit malġuk upkuaqpaich qulit malġuuŋarut qatiqtut uyaġaich akisuruat, ilimikkullaa upkuaqpaich savaaguvlutiŋ suġaitchuamiñ atautchimiñ qatiqtuamiñ akisuruamiñ uyaġaŋmiñ, suli apqutiŋi iniqpaum qivliqtuaq kaviqsuaq manik, tapiglakługu qiñiġnaqłuni igalauratun."
8003," Now I saw no temple in the city, because the Lord God – the All-Powerful – and the Lamb are its temple. ","Uvaŋa John tautuŋaitchuŋa aŋaiyyuvikpaŋmik iniqpaŋmi, qanuq aŋiayyuvikpauruq Ataniq God Sapiġñaqtuaq Imnaiyaaġlu. "
8004," The city does not need the sun or the moon to shine on it, because the glory of God lights it up, and its lamp is the Lamb. ","Suli iniqpak siqiñiqtuŋitchuq naaggaunnii tatqimik qaummatiksraŋanik, qanuq qaumanġa God-im qaummatigigaa, suli qulliġivlugu Imnaiyaaq. "
8005, The nations will walk by its light and the kings of the earth will bring their grandeur into it. ,"Nunauruat iñuuniaqtut qaumaniŋani, suli umialiŋi nunam qaġġirriñiaqtut suġaliġmiŋnik tavruŋa. "
8006, Its gates will never be closed during the day (and there will be no night there). ,Suli upkuaqpaŋi aŋmaniaqtut uvluqtutilaaŋatun. Umiŋniaŋitkaich sumikunnii qanuq unnuagiññiaqtuq.

8008," but nothing ritually unclean will ever enter into it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or practices falsehood, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb’s book of life. ",Aglaan sunapayaaq salumaitchuaq isiġumiñaitchuq iniqpaŋmun naaggaunnii kiñaliqaa piḷġusiqaqtuaq naġġunapiaġataqtuanik naagga saglunmik.
