1436,mrk.4.19,"But they start worrying about the needs of this life. They are fooled by the desire to get rich and to have all kinds of other things.

7039,heb.9.4," The gold altar for burning incense was in this holy place. The gold-covered sacred chest was also there, and inside it were three things. First, there was a gold jar filled with manna.  Then there was Aaron's walking stick that sprouted.  Finally, there were the flat stones with the Ten Commandments written on them.

7040,heb.9.5, On top of the chest were the glorious creatures with wings  opened out above the place of mercy. Now isn't the time to go into detail about these things. ,heb.9.5,Qaaŋaniinŋaruk matuam isaġullak qaummaġiksuak qulaŋiqsimavlugu nagliktuusiannagvik God-miñ. Taapkua paŋmapak uqautiginiaŋitkivut qanupiaq sivuniqaqtilaaŋat.
7041,heb.9.6, But this is how everything was when the priests went each day into the first part of the tent to do their duties. ,heb.9.6,"Tamatkua itqanaiganigataġmata tainna, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich ataramik uglaġaġniqsut siḷalliġmun tupiġmun, savaaġiugaqługich piraksrautitiŋ."
7042,heb.9.7," However, only the high priest could go into the second part of the tent, and he went in only once a year. Each time he carried blood to offer for his sins and for any sins that the people had committed without meaning to.",heb.9.7,"Aglaan iḷuanun kaŋiḷḷium aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat kisimi isiġuuniqsuq atausiaqsiññaqługu ukiuq, augutiligaaqłuni piḷuutaiġutiksramiñik iñuiḷḷu piḷuutiŋisa piiġutiksraŋannik."
7043,heb.9.8,All of this is the Holy Spirit's way of saying no one could enter the most holy place while the tent was still the place of worship. ,heb.9.8,"Taavrumuuna Ilitqusiġiksuam kaŋiqsipkaŋagaatigut taamna apqun inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamun God-mun aŋmaŋaisilaaŋanik-suli iñuich piḷḷasiḷugich tavruŋa, siḷallium tupqum napaniqtutilaaŋatun. "
7044,heb.9.9,This also has a meaning for today. It shows we cannot make our consciences clear by offering gifts and sacrifices. ,heb.9.9,Taamna siḷalliq tupiq qiñiġaaġimmatun itkaa paŋmapak piraġautchim.

7045,heb.9.10,These rules are merely about such things as eating and drinking and ceremonies for washing ourselves. And rules about physical things will last only until the time comes to change them for something better.,heb.9.10,Aglaan tamatkua piraġautchich aŋalatchirut aŋaiyyuliqiniġmi niqiłhiñaniglu imiłhiñamiglu qanusiḷimaaniglu aŋaiyyuliqinikun salummaksautinik timimun.

7046,heb.9.11, Christ came as the high priest of the good things that are now here.  He also went into a much better tent that wasn't made by humans and that doesn't belong to this world. ,heb.9.11,"Tavra paŋmapak Christ qaiganiŋaruq, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiat nakuuruanun sunun paŋmapak ittuanun.

7047,heb.9.12,Then Christ went once for all into the most holy place and freed us from sin forever. He did this by offering his own blood instead of the blood of goats and bulls.,heb.9.12,"Aasii aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiatitun Christ isiŋaruq pitqigaksraiqł̣ugu inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtauŋaruamun God-mun, augutiqaqłuni auŋił̣aaŋiññik niġrutit ikipkautausuuruat, aglaan ilaan auŋmiñik.

7048,heb.9.13," According to the Law of Moses, those people who become unclean are not fit to worship God. Yet they will be considered clean, if they are sprinkled with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a sacrificed calf. ",heb.9.13,Qanuq taimani iñuk piḷuksiruaq salummaqtaugayuktuq God-im sivuġaani qivsaliktaukami niġrutit ikipkautausuuruat auŋiññik.
7049,heb.9.14,"But Christ was sinless, and he offered himself as an eternal and spiritual sacrifice to God. This is why his blood is much more powerful and makes our  consciences clear. Now we can serve the living God and no longer do things that lead to death.",heb.9.14,"Taamna tainnainŋakpan, qanutułhaaq auŋata Christ salummaqtigivagich ilitqutchisi tuqunaqtuaniñ piḷġutchiñiñ savautiyumiñaqsivḷugu God iñuuruaq.

7050,heb.9.15,Christ died to rescue those who had sinned and broken the old agreement. Now he brings his chosen ones a new agreement with its guarantee of God's eternal blessings! ,heb.9.15,"Taamna pisigivlugu Christ atisipkaiñiaqtiġuŋaruq aitchuqłuta nutauruamik sivunniuġutaanik God-im, tamatkua ququaqtauruat aitchuusiaqaquvlugich isuitchuamik kiŋuvaaksramik God-im unniqsuqłiisaanik. Christ tuqukami tasuġumiñaqsiŋagai iñuich kamaksriŋitchuat God-im pitquraŋiñik sivulliġmi sivunniuġunmi. "
7051,heb.9.16,"In fact, making an agreement of this kind is like writing a will. This is because the one who makes the will must die before it is of any use. ",heb.9.16,"Kiñaliqaa sivunniqpan aitchuutigisukługich suġauttani kiŋuvaannaktuksrautinun aasii tuquvluni, taavruma iñuum tuquniŋa nalupqinaigaksrauruq kiŋuvaannaktuksrautit suġauttannaŋaiñŋaisa. "

7054,heb.9.19, Moses told the people all the Law said they must do. Then he used red wool and a hyssop plant to sprinkle the people and the book of the Law with the blood of bulls and goats  and with water. ,heb.9.19,"Qanuq Moses uqautigianiŋmagich pitqurapayaurat sivunniuġunmiittuat iluqaiññun iñuŋnun, ilaa tigusiŋaruq auŋiññik niġrutit ikipkautausuuruat, imiġmiglu, kavviġiksuamiglu imnaim mitquanik, piġuaqtiġunmiglu aasii qivsaliŋagai auŋmik makpiġaat, iluqaisalu iñuich,"

7056,heb.9.21, Moses also sprinkled blood on the tent and on everything else used in worship. ,heb.9.21,Tainnatun suli ilaan qivsalgutigiŋagaa auk tupiġmullu aŋaiyyuviŋmun utkusipayaanullu allallu supayaurat atuġuukkaŋi aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaum aŋaiyyuniġmi.

7058,heb.9.23,"These things are only copies of what is in heaven, and so they had to be made holy by these ceremonies. But the real things in heaven must be made holy by something better.

Aglaan qiḷaŋmiittuat ilaaguagaksrauŋarut auŋanik Christ nakuułhaaqtuamik aitchuunmik tamatkunaŋŋa. "
7059,heb.9.24,"This is why Christ did not go into a tent made by humans and was only a copy of the real one. Instead, he went into heaven and is now there with God to help us.",heb.9.24,"Qanuq Christ isianiŋaruq qiḷaŋmun sivuġaanun God-im uvagut pisivluta.

7060,heb.9.25,Christ did not have to offer himself many times. He wasn't like a high priest who goes into the most holy place each year to offer the blood of an animal. ,heb.9.25,"Naaggaunnii Christ aitchuutigitqigaġluni inmiñik piŋitchuq, aŋaiyyuliqsiqpaich qaukłiŋisun inimun ilaaguaqtaułhamaaqtuamun ukiutuaġman isiġuuruatun saagaqłuni auŋmik, ilaan augiŋisamiñik. "
7061,heb.9.26,"If he had offered himself every year, he would have suffered many times since the creation of the world. But instead, near the end of time he offered himself once and for all, so he could be a sacrifice that does away with sin.",heb.9.26,"Qanuq tainna Christ aitchuutigitqigaaġuugumi, nagliksaatqigaqtuksrauniaġaluaqtuq akulaitchuami nunaqaŋa savaagumman.

7063,heb.9.28," So Christ died only once to take away the sins of many people. But when he comes again, it will not be to take away sin. He will come to save everyone who is waiting for him.",heb.9.28,"Tainnatulli Christ, tuqutauganiŋavluni atausiaqłuni piiġiaqługich piḷuutiŋich iñugiaktuat, niptatqigñiaġmiuq, piḷuun piiġiasuŋaġnagu aglaan annautiyaqtuġlugich niġiupiaqtuat inmiñik."
7064,heb.10.1,"The Law of Moses is like a shadow of the good things to come.
